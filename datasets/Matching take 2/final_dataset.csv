4,2hb,600-15-7,1148.0,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): 2-Hydroxybutyric acid (alpha-hydroxybutyrate) is an organic acid derived from alpha-ketobutyrate. Alpha-ketobutyrate is produced by amino acid catabolism (threonine and methionine) and glutathione anabolism (cysteine formation pathway) and is metabolized to propionyl-CoA and carbon dioxide (PMID: 20526369 ). 2-Hydroxybutyric acid is formed as a by-product during the formation of Alpha-ketobutyrate via a reaction catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) or alpha–hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (alpha–HBDH). Alpha-hydroxybutyric acid is primarily produced in mammalian hepatic tissues that catabolize L-threonine or synthesize glutathione. Oxidative stress or detoxification of xenobiotics in the liver can dramatically increase the rate of hepatic glutathione synthesis. Under such metabolic stress conditions, supplies of L-cysteine for glutathione synthesis become limiting, so homocysteine is diverted from the transmethylation pathway (which forms methionine) into the transsulfuration pathway (which forms cystathionine). 2-Hydroxybutyrate is released as a byproduct when cystathionine is cleaved to cysteine that is incorporated into glutathione. Chronic shifts in the rate of glutathione synthesis may be reflected by urinary excretion of 2-hydroxybutyrate. 2-hydroxybutyrate is an early marker for both insulin resistance and impaired glucose regulation that appears to arise due to increased lipid oxidation and oxidative stress (PMID: 20526369 ). 2-Hydroxybutyric acid is often found in the urine of patients suffering from lactic acidosis and ketoacidosis. 2-Hydroxybutyric acid generally appears at high concentrations in situations related to deficient energy metabolism (e.g., birth asphyxia) and also in inherited metabolic diseases such as pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency and in those affecting the central nervous system during neonatal development, such as ""cerebral"" lactic acidosis, glutaric aciduria type II, dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3) deficiency, and propionic acidemia. More recently it has been noted that elevated levels of alpha-hydroxybutyrate in the plasma is a good marker for early stage type II diabetes (PMID:19166731 ). It was concluded from studies done in the mid 1970's that an increased NADH2/NAD ratio was the most important factor for the production of 2-hydroxybutyric acid (PMID:168632 ).",2-Hydroxybutyric acid,HMDB0000008,AFENDNXGAFYKQO-UHFFFAOYSA-M,"InChI=1S/C4H8O3/c1-2-3(5)4(6)7/h3,5H,2H2,1H3,(H,6,7)/p-1",C05984,CPD-3564,FDB021867,2hb,[H]OC([H])(C([O-])=O)C([H])([H])C([H])([H])[H],"2-Hydroxybutanoic acid***alpha-Hydroxybutanoic acid***alpha-Hydroxybutyric acid***2-Hydroxybutanoate***2-Hydroxybutyrate***a-Hydroxybutanoate***a-Hydroxybutanoic acid***alpha-Hydroxybutanoate***α-hydroxybutanoate***α-hydroxybutanoic acid***a-Hydroxybutyrate***a-Hydroxybutyric acid***alpha-Hydroxybutyrate***α-hydroxybutyrate***α-hydroxybutyric acid***(RS)-2-Hydroxybutyrate***(RS)-2-Hydroxybutyric acid***2-Hydroxy-butanoate***2-Hydroxy-butanoic acid***2-Hydroxy-DL-butyrate***2-Hydroxy-DL-butyric acid***2-Hydroxy-N-butyrate***2-Hydroxy-N-butyric acid***a-Hydroxy-N-butyrate***a-Hydroxy-N-butyric acid***alpha-Hydroxy-N-butyrate***alpha-Hydroxy-N-butyric acid***DL-2-Hydroxybutanoate***DL-2-Hydroxybutanoic acid***DL-a-Hydroxybutyrate***DL-a-Hydroxybutyric acid***DL-alpha-Hydroxybutyrate***DL-alpha-Hydroxybutyric acid***2-Hydroxybutyric acid, (R)-isomer***2-Hydroxybutyric acid, monosodium salt***2-Hydroxybutyric acid, (+-)-isomer***2-Hydroxybutyric acid, monosodium salt, (+-)-isomer",64552,2-hydroxybutyrate,"A hydroxy fatty acid anion that is the conjugate base of 2-hydroxybutyric acid, obtained by deprotonation of the carboxy group.","InChI=1S/C4H8O3/c1-2-3(5)4(6)7/h3,5H,2H2,1H3,(H,6,7)/p-1",alpha-hydroxybutanoate,Reaxys Registry Number,3661492

The peroxisomal beta-oxidation system contains two sets of enzymes, one of which is involved in the oxidation of branched chain fatty acids and intermediates in the hepatic bile acid biosynthetic pathway and consists of one or two branched-chain acyl-CoA oxidase(s), a D-specific bifunctional protein and the sterol carrier-like protein x (SCPx). Peroxisomes are cellular organelles present in all eukaryotic cells. They play an indispensable role in the metabolism of a variety of lipids including very long-chain fatty acids, dicarboxylic fatty acids, bile acids, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, thromboxanes, pristanic acid, and xenobiotic fatty acids. (S)-3-Hydroxyhexadecanoyl-CoA may accumulate intracellularly in certain long-chain fatty acid/j-oxidation deficiencies.

23,5aptn,660-88-8,15887.0,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): 5-aminovalerate (or 5-aminopentanoic acid) is a lysine degradation product.  It can be produced both endogenously or through bacterial catabolism of lysine.  5-aminovalerate is formed via the following multi-step reaction: L-lysine leads to cadverine leads to L-piperideine leads 5-aminovalerate (PMID: 405455).  In other words it is a metabolite of cadaverine which is formed via the intermediate, 1-piperideine (PMID: 6436440).  Cadaverine is a foul-smelling diamine compound produced by protein hydrolysis during putrefaction of animal tissue. High levels of 5-aminovalerate in biofluids may indicate bacterial overgrowth or endogenous tissue necrosis.  In most cases  endogenous 5-aminovalerate is thought to be primarily a microbial metabolite produced by the gut or oral microflora, although it can be produced endogenously.  5-aminovalerate is a normal metabolite present in human saliva, with a tendency to elevated concentration in patients with chronic periodontitis. Bacterial contamination and decomposition of salivary proteins is primarily responsible for elevated salivary levels (PMID 3481959). Beyond being a general waste product, 5-aminovalerate is also believed to act as a methylene homologue of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and functions as a weak GABA agonist (PMID: 4031870). It is also known as an antifibrinolytic amino acid analog and so it functions as a weak inhibitor of the blood clotting pathway (PMID: 6703712). 5-aminopentanoic acid is an in vivo substrate of 4-aminobutyrate:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase (PMID: 4031870).",5-Aminopentanoic acid,HMDB0003355,JJMDCOVWQOJGCB-UHFFFAOYSA-N,"InChI=1S/C5H11NO2/c6-4-2-1-3-5(7)8/h1-4,6H2,(H,7,8)",C00431,5-AMINOPENTANOATE,FDB023151,,,5-amino-N-Valeric acid***5-Aminopentanoate***5-Aminovaleric acid***DANVA***delta-amino-N-Valeric acid***delta-Aminovaleric acid***5-amino-N-Valerate***5-Aminovalerate***delta-amino-N-Valerate***δ-amino-N-valerate***δ-amino-N-valeric acid***delta-Aminovalerate***δ-aminovalerate***δ-aminovaleric acid***5-Aminovaleric acid hydrochloride,356010,5-aminopentanoic acid zwitterion,Zwitterionic form of 5-aminopentanoic acid having an anionic carboxy group and a protonated amino group.,"InChI=1S/C5H11NO2/c6-4-2-1-3-5(7)8/h1-4,6H2,(H,7,8)",5-ammoniopentanoate,Gmelin Registry Number,1042689

Favorable conditions include high moisture content (at least 7%) and high temperature. Aflatoxins B1 (AFB1) are contaminants of improperly stored foods; they are potent genotoxic and carcinogenic compounds, exerting their effects through damage to DNA. They can also induce mutations that increase oxidative damage. (PMID: 17214555).

34,btamp,4130-20-5,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): 5'-biotinyl-AMP (B-AMP) is the active form of biotin in mammals. In human cells, biotin is essential to maintain metabolic homeostasis and as regulator of gene expression. The vitamin biotin plays an essential role in gluconeogenesis, fatty acid synthesis, and carbohydrate metabolism because of its role as cofactor of five carboxylases; pyruvate carboxylase (PC), propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC), methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase, and two forms of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC-1 and ACC-2). Carboxylase biotinylation is catalyzed by the enzyme holocarboxylase synthetase (HCS) through a reaction that involves the transformation of biotin into B-AMP and its subsequent attachment to a specific lysine residue in the carboxylases. B-AMP is also required to activate a signal transduction cascade that includes a soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) and cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG). The regulatory role of biotin in the biotin cycle seems to be limited to the expression of proteins involved in the transport and utilization of exogenous vitamin while having no effect on biotinidase mRNA levels, enzyme responsible for biotin recycling during carboxylase turnover. Multiple carboxylase deficiency (MCD) is a life-threatening disease characterized by the lack of carboxylase activities because of deficiency of HCS activity.

Because it induces production of white blood cells and platelets, 5-androstenediol is being developed as a radiation countermeasure as Neumune (HE2100). An intermediate in testosterone biosynthesis, found in the testis or the adrenal glands. 5-Androstenediol, derived from dehydroepiandrosterone by the reduction of the 17-keto group (17-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases), is converted to testosterone by the oxidation of the 3-beta hydroxyl group to a 3-keto group (3-fydroxysteroid dehydrogenase).",5-Androstenediol,HMDB0003818,QADHLRWLCPCEKT-LOVVWNRFSA-N,"InChI=1S/C19H30O2/c1-18-9-7-13(20)11-12(18)3-4-14-15-5-6-17(21)19(15,2)10-8-16(14)18/h3,13-17,20-21H,4-11H2,1-2H3/t13-,14-,15-,16-,17-,18-,19-/m0/s1",C04295,,FDB023228,,[H]O[C@@]1([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])[C@@]2([H])[C@]3([H])C([H])([H])C([H])=C4C([H])([H])[C@@]([H])(O[H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])[C@]4(C([H])([H])[H])[C@@]3([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])[C@]12C([H])([H])[H],"(3beta,17beta)-Androst-5-ene-3,17-diol***3beta,17beta-Dihydroxy-5-androstene***3beta,17beta-Dihydroxyandrost-5-ene***Androst-5-en-3beta,17beta-diol***Androst-5-enediol***Androstenediol***Hermaphrodiol***(3b,17b)-Androst-5-ene-3,17-diol***(3β,17β)-androst-5-ene-3,17-diol***3b,17b-Dihydroxy-5-androstene***3β,17β-dihydroxy-5-androstene***3b,17b-Dihydroxyandrost-5-ene***3β,17β-dihydroxyandrost-5-ene***Androst-5-en-3b,17b-diol***Androst-5-en-3β,17β-diol***Androst-5-ene-3,17-diol***Androst-5-ene-3b,17b-diol***Androst-5-ene-3beta,17beta-diol***b,17b-Diol***delta-5-Androstenediol***Delta5-Androstenediol***Tetrabol***5 Androstene 3,17 diol***Delta 5-Androstenediol***Parke davis brand OF androstenediol***delta 5-Androstene-3 beta,17 beta-diol***5 Androstene 3beta 17beta diol***Androst 5 ene 3 beta,17 beta diol***Androst-5-ene-3 beta,17 beta-diol***5-Androstene-3beta-17beta-diol***Bisexovister***Delta 5 Androstenediol***5-Androstene-3,17-diol***Androst 5 ene 3,17 diol***delta 5 Androstene 3 beta,17 beta diol",2710,"androst-5-ene-3beta,17beta-diol",A 3beta-hydroxy steroid that is 3beta-hydroxyandrost-5-ene carrying an additional hydroxy group at position 17beta.,"InChI=1S/C19H30O2/c1-18-9-7-13(20)11-12(18)3-4-14-15-5-6-17(21)19(15,2)10-8-16(14)18/h3,13-17,20-21H,4-11H2,1-2H3/t13-,14-,15-,16-,17-,18-,19-/m0/s1","Androst-5-ene-3beta,17beta-diol",CAS Registry Number,521-17-5

41,C11695,94421-68-8,2700.0,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Anandamide is a highly potent endogenous agonist of the cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors. CB1 receptors are predominantly found in the central nervous system (CNS) where they mainly mediate the psychotropic effects of Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and endocannabinoids, whereas the expression of the CB2 receptor is thought to be restricted to cells of the immune system. It was suggested that AEA might inhibit tumor cell proliferation or induce apoptosis independently of CB1 and CB2 receptors, via interaction with the type 1 vanilloid receptor (VR1). VR1 is an ion channel expressed almost exclusively by sensory neurons, activated by pH, noxious heat (>48 degree centigrade) and plant toxins and is thought to play an important role in nociception. Cervical cancer cells are sensitive to AEA-induced apoptosis via VR1 that is aberrantly expressed in vitro and in vivo while CB1 and CB2 receptors play a protective role. (PMID 15047233). Novel prostaglandins (prostaglandin glycerol esters and prostaglandin ethanolamides) are COX-2 oxidative metabolites of endogenous cannabinoids (such as Anandamide).

Isobutyrylglycine is identified in large amount in urine of patients with isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. Isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency is a disorder caused by the deficiency of isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase that is involved in the catabolism of the branched-chain amino acid valine (PMID 15505379).

Normally, the cellular dITP concentration is very low. The inability to demonstrate the synthesis of dITP in cellular preparations has been attributed to the presence in the cytoplasm of an inosine triphosphatase pyrophosphatase (ITPase, EC 3.6.1.19), an enzyme that does not permit accumulation of these nucleotides. dITP can be incorporated into DNA by polymerases. The deoxyribonucleotide dITP behaves as a dGTP analogue and is incorporated opposite cytosine with about 50% efficiency. Both isolated nuclei and purified DNA polymerases rapidly incorporated dITP into DNA. In the presence of ATP, dITP is stabilized in extracts of nuclei. dITP exist in all cells and is potentially mutagenic, and the levels of these nucleotides are controlled by ITPase. The function of this ubiquitous protein family is proposed to be the elimination of minor potentially mutagenic or clastogenic purine nucleoside triphosphates from the cell.

62,dutp,1173-82-6,17625.0,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP) is a deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) that is chemically similar to uridine triphosphate (UTP) except that it has a deoxyribose sugar instead of a ribose sugar. DNA synthesis requires the availability of deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dTTP, dATP, dGTP, dCTP), whereas RNA synthesis requires the availability of nucleotide triphosphates (NTPs) such as TTP, ATP, GTP, and UTP. The conversion of nucleotide triphosphates (NTPs) into dNTPs can only be done in the diphosphate form. Typically, an NTP has one phosphate removed to become an NDP. This is then converted into a dNDP by an enzyme called ribonucleotide reductase and followed by the re-addition of phosphate to give a dNTP. dUTP is a substrate for several enzymes, including inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase, deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase (mitochondrial), uridine-cytidine kinase 1, nucleoside diphosphate kinase 3, nucleoside diphosphate kinase B, nucleoside diphosphate kinase 6, nucleoside diphosphate kinase (mitochondrial), nucleoside diphosphate kinase homolog 5, nucleoside diphosphate kinase A, and nucleoside diphosphate kinase 7. While UTP is routinely incorporated into RNA, dUTP is not normally incorporated into DNA. Instead, if dUTP is misincorporated into DNA, it can cause DNA damage. Therefore, dUTP can be considered as a teratogen or a mutagen. The extent of DNA damage caused by dUTP is highly dependent on the levels of the dUTP pyrophosphatase (dUTPase) and uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG), which limits the intracellular accumulation of dUTP. Additionally, loss of viability following thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibition occurs as a consequence of the accumulation of dUTP in some cell lines and subsequent misincorporation of uracil into DNA (PMID: 11487279).",Deoxyuridine triphosphate,HMDB0001191,AHCYMLUZIRLXAA-SHYZEUOFSA-J,"InChI=1S/C9H15N2O14P3/c12-5-3-8(11-2-1-7(13)10-9(11)14)23-6(5)4-22-27(18,19)25-28(20,21)24-26(15,16)17/h1-2,5-6,8,12H,3-4H2,(H,18,19)(H,20,21)(H,10,13,14)(H2,15,16,17)/p-4/t5-,6+,8+/m0/s1",C00460,DUTP,FDB022478,dutp,[H]O[C@@]1([H])C([H])([H])[C@@]([H])(O[C@]1([H])C([H])([H])OP([O-])(=O)OP([O-])(=O)OP([O-])([O-])=O)N1C([H])=C([H])C(=O)N([H])C1=O,2'-Deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate***2'-Deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphoric acid***Deoxyuridine triphosphoric acid***2'-Deoxyuridine-5'-triphosphorate***2'-Deoxyuridine-5'-triphosphoric acid***2'-Deoxyuridine-5'-triphosphoric acid = dUTP***Deoxy-UTP***Deoxyuridine-5'-triphosphate***dUTP,61555,dUTP(4-),A 2'-deoxyribonucleoside 5'-triphosphate(4-) resulting from deprotonation of the triphosphate OH groups of 2'-deoxyuridine-5'-triphosphate (dUTP); major species at pH 7.3.,"InChI=1S/C9H15N2O14P3/c12-5-3-8(11-2-1-7(13)10-9(11)14)23-6(5)4-22-27(18,19)25-28(20,21)24-26(15,16)17/h1-2,5-6,8,12H,3-4H2,(H,18,19)(H,20,21)(H,10,13,14)(H2,15,16,17)/p-4/t5-,6+,8+/m0/s1",deoxy-UTP(4-),MetaCyc accession,DUTP

Human platelets metabolize 8,11,14,17-eicosatetraenoic acid primarily into 12-hydroxy-8,10,14,17-eicosatetraenoic acid. The eicosanoids are a diverse family of molecules that have powerful effects on cell function. They are best known as intercellular messengers, having autocrine and paracrine effects following their secretion from the cells that synthesize them. The diversity of possible products that can be synthesized from eicosatrienoic acid is due, in part to the variety of enzymes that can act on it. Studies have placed many, but not all, of these enzymes at or inside the nucleus. In some cases, the nuclear import or export of eicosatrienoic acid-processing enzymes is highly regulated. Furthermore, nuclear receptors that are activated by specific eicosanoids are known to exist. Taken together, these findings indicate that the enzymatic conversion of eicosatrienoic acid to specific signaling molecules can occur in the nucleus, that it is regulated, and that the synthesized products may act within the nucleus.

66,fuc_L,2438-80-4,2181.0,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Fucose is a hexose deoxy sugar with the chemical formula C6H12O5. L-fucose (6-deoxy-L-galactose) is a monosaccharide that is a common component of many N- and O-linked glycans and glycolipids produced by mammalian cells. It is the fundamental sub-unit of the fucoidan polysaccharide. As a free sugar, L-fucose is normally found at very low levels in mammals. It is unique in that it is the only levorotatory sugar synthesized and utilized by mammals. Fucose polymers are synthesized by fucosyltransferases.  All fucosyltransferases utilize a nucleotide-activated form of fucose, GDP-fucose, as a fucose donor in the construction of fucosylated oligosaccharides. The ABO blood group antigens are among the most well known fucosylated glycans. The alpha-1->3 linked core fucose is a suspected carbohydrate antigen for IgE-mediated allergy. Two structural features distinguish fucose from other six-carbon sugars present in mammals: the lack of a hydroxyl group on the carbon at the 6-position (C-6) and the L-configuration. In fucose-containing glycan structures, fucosylated glycans, fucose can exist as a terminal modification or serve as an attachment point for adding other sugars. Fucose is metabolized by an enzyme called alpha-fucosidase. Fucose is secreted in urine when the liver is damaged.  Free L-fucose in serum and urine can be used as a marker for cancer, cirrhosis, alcoholic liver disease and gastric ulcers (PMID: 2311216) (PMID: 8488966). Elevated levels of serum fucose have been reported in breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, liver cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

The glucose molecule can exist in an open-chain (acyclic) and ring (cyclic) form, the latter being the result of an intramolecular reaction between the aldehyde C atom and the C-5 hydroxyl group to form an intramolecular hemiacetal. In water solution both forms are in equilibrium and at pH 7 the cyclic one is the predominant. Glucose is a primary source of energy for living organisms. It is naturally occurring and is found in fruits and other parts of plants in its free state. In animals glucose arises from the breakdown of glycogen in a process known as glycogenolysis. Glucose is synthesized in the liver and kidneys from non-carbohydrate intermediates, such as pyruvate and glycerol, by a process known as gluconeogenesis.

Mutations have been described in the GLDC (OMIM 238300), AMT (OMIM 238310), and GCSH (OMIM 238330) genes encoding the P-, T-, and H-proteins respectively. The glycine cleavage system catalyses the oxidative conversion of glycine into carbon dioxide and ammonia, with the remaining one-carbon unit transferred to folate as methylenetetrahydrofolate. It is the main catabolic pathway for glycine and it also contributes to one-carbon metabolism. Patients with a deficiency of this enzyme system have increased glycine in plasma, urine and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with an increased CSF: plasma glycine ratio.

77,HC02020,601-34-3,3663.0,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Cholesteryl palmitic acid is a cholesteryl ester. A cholesteryl ester is an ester of cholesterol. Fatty acid esters of cholesterol constitute about two-thirds of the cholesterol in the plasma. Cholesterol is a sterol (a combination steroid and alcohol) and a lipid found in the cell membranes of all body tissues, and transported in the blood plasma of all animals. The accumulation of cholesterol esters in the arterial intima (the innermost layer of an artery, in direct contact with the flowing blood) is a characteristic feature of atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a disease affecting arterial blood vessels. It is a chronic inflammatory response in the walls of arteries, in large part to the deposition of lipoproteins (plasma proteins that carry cholesterol and triglycerides). CE(16:0) may also accumulate in hereditary hypercholesterolemia, an inborn error of metabolism. Cholesteryl palmitate is one of the four important lipids found in the tear film.

Fatty acid esters of cholesterol constitute about two-thirds of the cholesterol in the plasma. Cholesterol is a sterol (a combination steroid and alcohol) and a lipid found in the cell membranes of all body tissues, and transported in the blood plasma of all animals. The accumulation of cholesterol esters in the arterial intima (the innermost layer of an artery, in direct contact with the flowing blood) is a characteristic feature of atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a disease affecting arterial blood vessels. It is a chronic inflammatory response in the walls of arteries, in large part to the deposition of lipoproteins (plasma proteins that carry cholesterol and triglycerides). Cholesteryl linoleate is contained in low density lipoprotein and atherosclerotic lesions. The oxidation products of cholesteryl linoleate may cause chronic inflammatory processes.

81,HC02196,64480-66-6,542261.0,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Glycoursodeoxycholic acid is an acyl glycine and a bile acid-glycine conjugate. It is a secondary bile acid produced by the action of enzymes existing in the microbial flora of the colonic environment. In hepatocytes, both primary and secondary bile acids undergo amino acid conjugation at the C-24 carboxylic acid on the side chain, and almost all bile acids in the bile duct therefore exist in a glycine conjugated form (PMID:16949895). Bile acids are steroid acids found predominantly in bile of mammals. The distinction between different bile acids is minute, depends only on presence or absence of hydroxyl groups on positions 3, 7, and 12. Bile acids are physiological detergents that facilitate excretion, absorption, and transport of fats and sterols in the intestine and liver. Bile acids are also steroidal amphipathic molecules derived from the catabolism of cholesterol. They modulate bile flow and lipid secretion, are essential for the absorption of dietary fats and vitamins, and have been implicated in the regulation of all the key enzymes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Bile acids recirculate through the liver, bile ducts, small intestine and portal vein to form an enterohepatic circuit. They exist as anions at physiological pH and, consequently, require a carrier for transport across the membranes of the enterohepatic tissues. The unique detergent properties of bile acids are essential for the digestion and intestinal absorption of hydrophobic nutrients. Bile acids have potent toxic properties (e.g., membrane disruption) and there are a plethora of mechanisms to limit their accumulation in blood and tissues.

82,hdcoa,18198-76-0,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Palmitoleyl coenzyme A is a monounsaturated fatty acid, the product of palmitoyl-CoA from a reaction catalyzed by stearoyl-CoA desaturase (EC 1.14.99.5, SCD) in the endoplasmic reticulum, an enzyme that catalyzes the delta9-cis desaturation of saturated fatty acyl-CoAs. These monounsaturated fatty acids are used as substrates for the synthesis of triglycerides, wax esters, cholesteryl esters and membrane phospholipids. The saturated to monounsaturated fatty acid ratio affects membrane phospholipid composition and alteration in this ratio has been implicated in a variety of disease states including cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, neurological disease, skin disorders and cancer. Thus, the expression of SCD is of physiological importance in normal and disease states. Unsaturated fatty acids are the most abundant form of stored fat in the human body and are vital for all living organisms.

84,pmeth,544-31-0,147261.0,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): N-Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is present in the tissues of most mammals. It was initially described as an agonist of the type 2 cannabinoid receptor (CB2), although it is now universally recognized that PEA is in fact incapable of binding to cannabinoid receptors, or at least not to the known receptors. In addition to its anti-inflammatory activity, PEA also produces analgesia, neuroprotection, and possesses anti-epileptic properties. It also reduces gastrointestinal motility and cancer cell proliferation, as well as protecting the vascular endothelium in the ischemic heart. The physiological stimuli that regulate PEA levels in mammalian tissues are largely unknown, however, multiple studies indicate that this lipid accumulates during cellular stress, particularly following tissue injury. For example, PEA increases post-mortem in the pig brain. Similar elevations in PEA levels have been observed in the ischemic brain and PEA is also up-regulated in response to ultraviolet-B irradiation in mouse epidermal cells. Adipose tissue is highly implicated in the systemic secretion of IL-6 and leptin, and human mature adipocytes are able to secrete large quantity of PEA. Human adipose tissue can be subjected to modulation of its inflammatory state by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS strongly inhibits adipose cell leptin release, with PEA acting as a potentiator of this inhibitory effect. These actions are not linked to a reduction in leptin gene transcription. Thus, PEA does not have an anti-inflammatory role in the secretion of IL-6 via NFkappaB at the adipocyte level, but instead seems to act at the heart of the LPS-stimulated pathway, which, independently of NFkappaB, inhibits the secretion of leptin.

89,hpdcacrn,106182-29-0,131887.0,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Heptadecanoyl carnitine is an acylcarnitine. Numerous disorders have been described that lead to disturbances in energy production and in intermediary metabolism in the organism which are characterized by the production and excretion of unusual acylcarnitines. A mutation in the gene coding for carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase or the OCTN2 transporter aetiologically causes a carnitine deficiency that results in poor intestinal absorption of dietary L-carnitine, its impaired reabsorption by the kidney and, consequently, in increased urinary loss of L-carnitine. Determination of the qualitative pattern of acylcarnitines can be of diagnostic and therapeutic importance. The betaine structure of carnitine requires special analytical procedures for recording. The ionic nature of L-carnitine causes a high water solubility which decreases with increasing chain length of the ester group in the acylcarnitines. Therefore, the distribution of L-carnitine and acylcarnitines in various organs is defined by their function and their physico-chemical properties as well.

91,hx2coa,10018-93-6,28706.0,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): trans-Hexenoyl-CoA is an intermediate in fatty acid metabolism. Beta-oxidation occurs in both mitochondria and peroxisomes. Mitochondria catalyze the beta-oxidation of the bulk of short-, medium-, and long-chain fatty acids derived from diet, and this pathway constitutes the major process by which fatty acids are oxidized to generate energy. Peroxisomes are involved in the beta-oxidation chain shortening of long-chain and very-long-chain fatty acyl-coenzyme (CoAs), long-chain dicarboxylyl-CoAs, the CoA esters of eicosanoids, 2-methyl-branched fatty acyl-CoAs, and the CoA esters of the bile acid intermediates di- and trihydroxycoprostanoic acids, and in the process they generate H2O2. Long-chain and very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) are also metabolized by the cytochrome P450 CYP4A omega-oxidation system to dicarboxylic acids that serve as substrates for peroxisomal beta-oxidation. The peroxisomal beta-oxidation system consists of (a) a classical peroxisome proliferator-inducible pathway capable of catalyzing straight-chain acyl-CoAs by fatty acyl-CoA oxidase, L-bifunctional protein, and thiolase, and (b) a second noninducible pathway catalyzing the oxidation of 2-methyl-branched fatty acyl-CoAs by branched-chain acyl-CoA oxidase (pristanoyl-CoA oxidase/trihydroxycoprostanoyl-CoA oxidase), D-bifunctional protein, and sterol carrier protein (SCP)x.  trans-Hexenoyl-CoA is the substrate of the enzymes enoyl-coenzyme A reductase, acyl-CoA oxidase [EC 1.3.99.2-1.3.3.6], acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, long-chain-acyl-CoA dehydrogenase [EC 1.3.99.3-1.3.99.13], and Oxidoreductases [EC 1.3.99.-]; trans-Hexenoyl-CoA is an intermediate in fatty acid elongation in mitochondria, being the substrate of the enzymes enoyl-CoA hydratase and long-chain-enoyl-CoA hydratase [EC 4.2.1.17-4.2.1.74].

93,hyochol,547-75-1,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Hyocholic acid is a bile acid. Bile acids are steroid acids found predominantly in bile of mammals. The distinction between different bile acids is minute, depends only on presence or absence of hydroxyl groups on positions 3, 7, and 12. Bile acids are physiological detergents that facilitate excretion, absorption, and transport of fats and sterols in the intestine and liver. Bile acids are also steroidal amphipathic molecules derived from the catabolism of cholesterol. They modulate bile flow and lipid secretion, are essential for the absorption of dietary fats and vitamins, and have been implicated in the regulation of all the key enzymes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Bile acids recirculate through the liver, bile ducts, small intestine and portal vein to form an enterohepatic circuit. They exist as anions at physiological pH and, consequently, require a carrier for transport across the membranes of the enterohepatic tissues. The unique detergent properties of bile acids are essential for the digestion and intestinal absorption of hydrophobic nutrients. Bile acids have potent toxic properties (e.g., membrane disruption) and there are a plethora of mechanisms to limit their accumulation in blood and tissues.

Relatively high levels of ITP in red cells are found in individuals as result of deficiency of inosine triphosphatase (EC 3.1.3.56, ITPase) ITPase is a cytosolic nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase specific for ITP catalysis to inosine monophosphate (IMP) and deoxy-inosine triphosphate (dITP) to deoxy-inosine monophosphate. ITPase deficiency is not associated with any defined pathology other than the characteristic and abnormal accumulation of ITP in red blood cells. Nevertheless, ITPase deficiency may have pharmacogenomic implications, and the abnormal metabolism of 6-mercaptopurine in ITPase-deficient patients may lead to thiopurine drug toxicity. ITPase's function is not clearly understood but possible roles for ITPase could be to prevent the accumulation of rogue nucleotides which would be otherwise incorporated into DNA and RNA, or compete with nucleotides such as GTP in signalling processes.

126,M02107,,37283.0,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Heptanoyl-CoA is an acyl-CoA with the C-7 fatty acid Acyl chain moiety. Acyl-CoA (or formyl-CoA) is a coenzyme involved in the metabolism of fatty acids. It is a temporary compound formed when coenzyme A (CoA) attaches to the end of a long-chain fatty acid, inside living cells. The CoA is then removed from the chain, carrying two carbons from the chain with it, forming acetyl-CoA. This is then used in the citric acid cycle to start a chain of reactions, eventually forming many adenosine triphosphates. To be oxidatively degraded, a fatty acid must first be activated in a two-step reaction catalyzed by acyl-CoA synthetase. First, the fatty acid displaces the diphosphate group of ATP, then coenzyme A (HSCoA) displaces the AMP group to form an Acyl-CoA. The acyladenylate product of the first step has a large free energy of hydrolysis and conserves the free energy of the cleaved phosphoanhydride bond in ATP. The second step, transfer of the acyl group to CoA (the same molecule that carries acetyl groups as acetyl-CoA), conserves free energy in the formation of a thioester bond. Consequently, the overall reaction Fatty acid + CoA + ATP <=> Acyl-CoA + AMP + PPi has a free energy change near zero.

128,M02669,50-56-6,7872.0,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Oxytocin is a mammalian hormone that also acts as a neurotransmitter in the brain. In women, it is released mainly after distention of the cervix and vagina during labor, and after stimulation of the nipples, facilitating birth and breastfeeding, respectively. Oxytocin is released during orgasm in both sexes. In the brain, oxytocin is involved in social recognition and bonding, and might be involved in the formation of trust between people. -- Wikipedia; In the pituitary gland, oxytocin is packaged in large, dense-core vesicles, where it is bound to neurophysin as shown in the inset of the figure; neurophysin is a large peptide fragment of the giant precursor protein molecule from which oxytocin is derived by enzymatic cleavage. -- Wikipedia; Oxytocin is a peptide of nine amino acids (a nonapeptide). The sequence is cysteine - tyrosine - isoleucine - glutamine - asparagine - cysteine - proline - leucine - glycine (CYIQNCPLG). The cysteine residues form a sulfur bridge. Oxytocin has a molecular mass of 1007 daltons. One international unit (IU) of oxytocin is the equivalent of about 2 micrograms of pure peptide. -- Wikipedia; Oxytocin has peripheral (hormonal) actions, and also has actions in the brain. The actions of oxytocin are mediated by specific, high affinity oxytocin receptors. The oxytocin receptor is a G-protein-coupled receptor which requires Mg2+ and cholesterol.

Several intracellular proteins, such as lectins, chaperones and glycan-processing enzymes, are involved in this process. These include calnexin/calreticulin, UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGGT), cargo receptors (such as VIP36 and ERGIC-53), mannosidase-like proteins (e.g. EDEM and Htm1p) and ubiquitin ligase (Fbs). They are thought to recognize high-mannose-type glycans with subtly different structures. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is an important constituent of the innate immune system. This protein binds through multiple lectin domains to the repeating sugar arrays that decorate many microbial surfaces, and is then able to activate the complement system through a specific protease called MBL-associated protease-2. The primary pathway for the formation of L-fucose in procaryotic and eucaryotic cells is from D-mannose via an internal oxidation reduction and then epimerization of GDP-D-mannose to produce GDP-L-fucose.

139,oleth,111-58-0,116103.0,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): N-Oleoylethanolamine (NOE or OEA) is a N-acylethanolamine. N-acylethanolamines (NAEs) constitute a class of lipid compounds naturally present in both animal and plant membranes as constituents of the membrane-bound phospholipid, N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE). NAPE is composed of a third fatty acid moiety linked to the amino head group of the commonly occurring membrane phospholipid, phosphatidylethanolamine. NAEs are released from NAPE by phospholipase D-type hydrolases in response to a variety of stimuli. Transient NAE release and accumulation has been attributed a variety of biological activities, including neurotransmission, membrane protection, and immunomodulation in animals. N-oleoylethanolamine is an inhibitor of the sphingolipid signaling pathway, via specific ceramidase inhibition (ceramidase converts ceramide to sphingosine). N-oleoylethanolamine blocks the effects of TNF- and arachidonic acid on intracellular Ca concentration. (PMID: 12692337, 12056855, 12560208, 11997249). N-oleoyl ethanolamine is related to the endocannabinoid anandamide. Endocannabinoids signal through cannabinoid receptors (also stimulated by the active ingredient of cannabis) but although related in structure, synthesis and degradation to anandamide, NOE cannot be considered an endocannabinoid as it does not activate the cannabinoid receptors. Most of the reported responses to NOE can be attributed to activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha). Administration of NOE inhibits body weight gain in rats. In adipocytes and hepatocytes, NOE inhibits mitogenic and metabolic signaling by the insulin receptor and produces glucose intolerance. It also inhibits gastric emptying, which might act together with the sensory neuronal signals to achieve satiety. NOE is permanently elevated in diabetic obese patients. NOE also reduces visceral and inflammatory responses through a PPAR-alpha-activation independent mechanism (PMID: 17449181). NOE has been shown to be an antagonist of TRVP1 (the transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 receptor). Overall, NOE has beneficial effects on health by inducing food intake control, lipid beta-oxidation, body weight loss and analgesic effects (PMID: 18704536).",N-Oleoylethanolamine,HMDB0002088,BOWVQLFMWHZBEF-KTKRTIGZSA-N,"InChI=1S/C20H39NO2/c1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-11-12-13-14-15-16-17-20(23)21-18-19-22/h9-10,22H,2-8,11-19H2,1H3,(H,21,23)/b10-9-",,,FDB022839,oleth,[H]OC([H])([H])C([H])([H])N([H])C(=O)C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C(\[H])=C(\[H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])[H],"N-(2-Hydroxyethyl)-9-octadecenamide***N-(2-Hydroxyethyl)oleamide***N-(9Z-Octadecenoyl) ethanolamine***N-(9Z-Octadecenoyl)-ethanolamine***N-(cis-9-Octadecenoyl) ethanolamine***N-(Hydroxyethyl)oleamide***N-Oleoyl ethanolamine***OEA***Oleamide mea***Oleoyl 1-ethanolamide***Oleoyl monoethanolamide***Oleoylethanolamide***N-Oleoyl ethanolamine, oleoyl monoethanolamide, oleoylethanolamide***N-Oleoyl-2-aminoethanol***NOE***Oleic acid ethanolamide***Oleic acid monoethanolamide***N-OEA",71466,oleoyl ethanolamide,An N-(long-chain-acyl)ethanolamine that is the ethanolamide of oleic acid.

142,peamn,64-04-0,18397.0,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Phenethylamine (PEA) is an aromatic amine, which is a colorless liquid at room temperature. It is soluble in water, ethanol, and ether. Similar to other low-molecular-weight amines, it has a fishy odor. Upon exposure to air, it forms a solid carbonate salt with carbon dioxide. Phenethylamine is strongly basic and forms a stable crystalline hydrochloride salt with a melting point of 217 oC. Phenethylamine is also a skin irritant and possible sensitizer. Phenethylamine also has a constitutional isomer (+)-phenylethylamine (1-phenylethylamine), which has two stereoisomers: (R)-(+)-1-phenylethylamine and (S)-(-)-1-phenylethylamine. In the human brain, 2-phenethylamine is believed to function as a neuromodulator or neurotransmitter (a trace amine). Phenethylamine can be biosynthesized from the amino acid phenylalanine by enzymatic decarboxylation. It is also found in many foods such as chocolate, especially after microbial fermentation. However trace amounts from food are quickly metabolized by the enzyme MAO-B (into phenylacetic acid), preventing significant concentrations from reaching the brain. Phenylethylamine is a precursor to the neurotransmitter phenylethanolamine. High levels of PEA have been found in the urine of schizophrenics but it is not significantly elevated in the serum or CSF of schizophrenics (PMID: 7906896, PMID: 7360842).  Urinary levels of PEA are significantly lower in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (PMID: 12205654).  It has been found that PEA is the primary compound found in carnivore (especially cat) urine that leads to rodent (mouse and rat) avoidance. In other words, phenylethylamine is useful for scaring off rodent pests.  Quantitative HPLC analysis across 38 mammalian species has shown that PEA production in urine is especially enhanced in carnivores, with some producing >3,000-fold more than herbivores (PMID: 21690383).",Phenylethylamine,HMDB0012275,BHHGXPLMPWCGHP-UHFFFAOYSA-O,"InChI=1S/C8H11N/c9-7-6-8-4-2-1-3-5-8/h1-5H,6-7,9H2/p+1",C05332,PHENYLETHYLAMINE,FDB010580,peamn,[H]C1=C([H])C([H])=C(C([H])=C1[H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])[N+]([H])([H])[H],"Benzeneethanamine***beta-Aminoethylbenzene***beta-Phenethylamine***beta-Phenylethylamine***Phenethylamine***b-Aminoethylbenzene***β-aminoethylbenzene***b-Phenethylamine***β-phenethylamine***b-Phenylethylamine***β-phenylethylamine***(2-Aminoethyl)benzene***(2-Aminoethyl)polystyrene***1-amino-2-Phenylethane***1-Phenethylamine***1-Phenyl-2-amino-athan***1-Phenyl-2-aminoethane***1TNJ***1Utm***1Uto***2-amino-1-Phenylethane***2-amino-Fenylethan***2-Fenylethylamin***2-Phenethylamine***2-Phenyl-ethanamine***2-Phenylethanamine***2-Phenylethanamine (acd/name 4.0)***2-Phenylethylamine***2-Phenylethylamine (acd/name 4.0)***b-Phenylaethylamin***Benzeneethanamine hydrochloride***beta Phenethylamine***beta-Phenylaethylamin***Omega-phenylethylamine***PEA***Phenethylamine hydrochloride***Polystyrene a-NH2***Phenethylamine hydrobromide***Phenethylamine tosylate***Phenethylamine conjugate acid***Phenethylamine sulfate***Phenethylamine, monolithium salt***2-Phenylethylammonium chloride***Phenethylamine sulfate (2:1)***Phenethylamine, 15N-labeled CPD***Phenethylamine mesylate***Phenethylamine perchlorate***Phenethylamine, beta-(14)C-labeled CPD",225237,2-phenylethanaminium,The cation obtained by protonation of the amino group of 2-phenylethylamine.,"InChI=1S/C8H11N/c9-7-6-8-4-2-1-3-5-8/h1-5H,6-7,9H2/p+1",Phenethyl-ammonium,PDBeChem accession,PEA

159,xol24oh,474-73-7,34310.0,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): 24-Hydroxycholesterol (24OHC) is almost exclusively formed in the brain. The enzymatic conversion of CNS cholesterol to 24OHC, which readily crosses the blood-brain barrier, is the major pathway for brain cholesterol elimination and brain cholesterol homeostasis maintenance. The enzyme mediating this conversion has been characterized at the molecular level as cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.13.98, CYP46) and is mainly located in neurons. Like other oxysterols, 24OHC is efficiently converted into normal bile acids or excreted in bile in its sulfated and glucuronidated form. Levels of 24OHC in the circulation decrease with age in infants and children. In adults, however, the levels appear to be stable. There is accumulating evidence pointing toward a potentially important link between cholesterol, beta-amyloid, and Alzheimer's disease. Patients with active demyelinating diseases had increased levels of 24OHC in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Patients with Alzheimer's disease have slightly increased levels of 24OHC in CSF. Patients with multiple sclerosis have a tendency to have higher levels of 24OHC during active periods.

4,2hb,600-15-7,1148.0,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): 2-Hydroxybutyric acid (alpha-hydroxybutyrate) is an organic acid derived from alpha-ketobutyrate. Alpha-ketobutyrate is produced by amino acid catabolism (threonine and methionine) and glutathione anabolism (cysteine formation pathway) and is metabolized to propionyl-CoA and carbon dioxide (PMID: 20526369 ). 2-Hydroxybutyric acid is formed as a by-product during the formation of Alpha-ketobutyrate via a reaction catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) or alpha–hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (alpha–HBDH). Alpha-hydroxybutyric acid is primarily produced in mammalian hepatic tissues that catabolize L-threonine or synthesize glutathione. Oxidative stress or detoxification of xenobiotics in the liver can dramatically increase the rate of hepatic glutathione synthesis. Under such metabolic stress conditions, supplies of L-cysteine for glutathione synthesis become limiting, so homocysteine is diverted from the transmethylation pathway (which forms methionine) into the transsulfuration pathway (which forms cystathionine). 2-Hydroxybutyrate is released as a byproduct when cystathionine is cleaved to cysteine that is incorporated into glutathione. Chronic shifts in the rate of glutathione synthesis may be reflected by urinary excretion of 2-hydroxybutyrate. 2-hydroxybutyrate is an early marker for both insulin resistance and impaired glucose regulation that appears to arise due to increased lipid oxidation and oxidative stress (PMID: 20526369 ). 2-Hydroxybutyric acid is often found in the urine of patients suffering from lactic acidosis and ketoacidosis. 2-Hydroxybutyric acid generally appears at high concentrations in situations related to deficient energy metabolism (e.g., birth asphyxia) and also in inherited metabolic diseases such as pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency and in those affecting the central nervous system during neonatal development, such as ""cerebral"" lactic acidosis, glutaric aciduria type II, dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3) deficiency, and propionic acidemia. More recently it has been noted that elevated levels of alpha-hydroxybutyrate in the plasma is a good marker for early stage type II diabetes (PMID:19166731 ). It was concluded from studies done in the mid 1970's that an increased NADH2/NAD ratio was the most important factor for the production of 2-hydroxybutyric acid (PMID:168632 ).",2-Hydroxybutyric acid,HMDB0000008,AFENDNXGAFYKQO-UHFFFAOYSA-M,"InChI=1S/C4H8O3/c1-2-3(5)4(6)7/h3,5H,2H2,1H3,(H,6,7)/p-1",C05984,CPD-3564,FDB021867,2hb,[H]OC([H])(C([O-])=O)C([H])([H])C([H])([H])[H],"2-Hydroxybutanoic acid***alpha-Hydroxybutanoic acid***alpha-Hydroxybutyric acid***2-Hydroxybutanoate***2-Hydroxybutyrate***a-Hydroxybutanoate***a-Hydroxybutanoic acid***alpha-Hydroxybutanoate***α-hydroxybutanoate***α-hydroxybutanoic acid***a-Hydroxybutyrate***a-Hydroxybutyric acid***alpha-Hydroxybutyrate***α-hydroxybutyrate***α-hydroxybutyric acid***(RS)-2-Hydroxybutyrate***(RS)-2-Hydroxybutyric acid***2-Hydroxy-butanoate***2-Hydroxy-butanoic acid***2-Hydroxy-DL-butyrate***2-Hydroxy-DL-butyric acid***2-Hydroxy-N-butyrate***2-Hydroxy-N-butyric acid***a-Hydroxy-N-butyrate***a-Hydroxy-N-butyric acid***alpha-Hydroxy-N-butyrate***alpha-Hydroxy-N-butyric acid***DL-2-Hydroxybutanoate***DL-2-Hydroxybutanoic acid***DL-a-Hydroxybutyrate***DL-a-Hydroxybutyric acid***DL-alpha-Hydroxybutyrate***DL-alpha-Hydroxybutyric acid***2-Hydroxybutyric acid, (R)-isomer***2-Hydroxybutyric acid, monosodium salt***2-Hydroxybutyric acid, (+-)-isomer***2-Hydroxybutyric acid, monosodium salt, (+-)-isomer",1148,2-hydroxybutyric acid,A hydroxybutyric acid having a single hydroxyl group located at position 2; urinary secretion of 2-hydroxybutyric acid is increased with alcohol ingestion or vigorous physical exercise and is associated with lactic acidosis and ketoacidosis in humans and diabetes in animals.,"InChI=1S/C4H8O3/c1-2-3(5)4(6)7/h3,5H,2H2,1H3,(H,6,7)",2-Hydroxybutyric acid,KEGG COMPOUND accession,C05984

8,3mlda,2625-49-2,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Methylimidazoleacetic acid is the main metabolite of histamine.

From studies is known that as much as 70 to 80 percent of the histamine metabolized in the body is excreted in the urine as Methylimidazoleacetic acid. Thus, urinary Methylimidazoleacetic acid being the major and specific histamine metabolite is a clear marker of any changes in histamine metabolism in the body. The urinary excretion of methylimidazoleacetic acid is considered a reliable indicator of histamine turnover rate in the body. The excretion of Methylimidazoleacetic acid is higher in men than women however; this gender difference is abolished when corrected for creatinine excretion. A possible explanation is that basal histamine turnover is related to body size. There is no significant difference in Methylimidazoleacetic acid excretion between smokers and non-smokers when analysing absolute values (mg/24 h). When using Methylimidazoleacetic acid values corrected for creatinine excretion female smokers have significantly higher Methylimidazoleacetic acid excretion compared to nonsmokers.

23,btamp,4130-20-5,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): 5'-biotinyl-AMP (B-AMP) is the active form of biotin in mammals. In human cells, biotin is essential to maintain metabolic homeostasis and as regulator of gene expression. The vitamin biotin plays an essential role in gluconeogenesis, fatty acid synthesis, and carbohydrate metabolism because of its role as cofactor of five carboxylases; pyruvate carboxylase (PC), propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC), methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase, and two forms of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC-1 and ACC-2). Carboxylase biotinylation is catalyzed by the enzyme holocarboxylase synthetase (HCS) through a reaction that involves the transformation of biotin into B-AMP and its subsequent attachment to a specific lysine residue in the carboxylases. B-AMP is also required to activate a signal transduction cascade that includes a soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) and cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG). The regulatory role of biotin in the biotin cycle seems to be limited to the expression of proteins involved in the transport and utilization of exogenous vitamin while having no effect on biotinidase mRNA levels, enzyme responsible for biotin recycling during carboxylase turnover. Multiple carboxylase deficiency (MCD) is a life-threatening disease characterized by the lack of carboxylase activities because of deficiency of HCS activity.

25,C06314,89663-86-5,6498.0,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Lipoxin A4 (LXA4) was first identified in 1984 by Serhan and colleagues as 5-lipoxygenase interaction product of activated leukocytes. Endogenous transcellular biosynthesis of LXA4 occurs via interaction of leukocytes with epithelium, endothelium or platelets. Lipoxins (LXs) or the lipoxygenase interaction products are generated from arachidonic acid via sequential actions of lipoxygenases and subsequent reactions to give specific trihydroxytetraene-containing eicosanoids. These unique structures are formed during cell-cell interactions and appear to act at both temporal and spatially distinct sites from other eicosanoids produced during the course of inflammatory responses and to stimulate natural resolution. Lipoxin A4 (LXA4) and lipoxin B4 (LXB4) are positional isomers that each possesses potent cellular and in vivo actions. These LX structures are conserved across species. The results of numerous studies reviewed in this work now confirm that they are the first recognized eicosanoid chemical mediators that display both potent anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving actions in vivo in disease models that include rabbit, rat, and mouse systems. LXs act at specific GPCRs as agonists to regulate cellular responses of interest in inflammation and resolution. Aspirin has a direct impact in the LX circuit by triggering the biosynthesis of endogenous epimers of LX, termed the aspirin-triggered 15-epi-LX, that share the potent anti-inflammatory actions of LX.

26,C06315,98049-69-5,6499.0,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Lipoxins (LXs) and aspirin-triggered Lipoxin (ATL) are trihydroxytetraene-containing eicosanoids generated from arachidonic acid that are distinct in structure, formation, and function from the many other proinflammatory lipid-derived mediators. These endogenous eicosanoids have now emerged as founding members of the first class of lipid/chemical mediators involved in the resolution of the inflammatory response. Lipoxin A4 (LXA4), ATL, and their metabolic stable analogs elicit cellular responses and regulate leukocyte trafficking in vivo by activating the specific receptor, ALX. Many of the eicosanoids derived from arachidonic acid (AA2), including prostaglandins (PGs) and leukotrienes (LTs), play important roles as local mediators exerting a wide range of actions relevant in immune hypersensitivity and inflammation. However, recent observations indicate that other agents derived from the lipoxygenase (LO) pathways are formed and play a key role in initiating the resolution of acute inflammation. This phenomenon is an active process that is governed by specific lipid mediators and involves a series of well-orchestrated temporal events. Thus, potent locally released mediators serve as checkpoint controllers of inflammation. In addition to the well-appreciated ability of aspirin to inhibit PGs, aspirin also acetylates cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, triggering the formation of a 15-epimeric form of lipoxins, termed aspirin-triggered LXA4 (ATL).

30,C14770,81276-02-0,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): 11,12-Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid is an epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET). Induction of CYP2C8 in native coronary artery endothelial cells by beta-naphthoflavone enhances the formation of 11,12-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid, as well as endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor-mediated hyperpolarization and relaxation. Transfection of coronary arteries with CYP2C8 antisense oligonucleotides resulted in decreased levels of CYP2C and attenuated the endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor-mediated vascular responses. Thus, a CYP-epoxygenase product is an essential component of the endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor-mediated relaxation in the porcine coronary artery, and CYP2C8 fulfills the criteria for the coronary endothelium-derived hyperpolarization factor synthase. The role of EETs in regulation of the cerebral circulation has become more important, since it was realized that EETs are produced in another specialized cell type of the brain, the astrocytes. It has become evident that EETs released from astrocytes may mediate cerebral functional hyperemia. Molecular and pharmacological evidence hve shown that neurotransmitter release and spillover onto astrocytes can generate EETs. Since these EETs may reach the vasculature via astrocyte foot-processes, they have the same potential as their endothelial counterparts to hyperpolarize and dilate cerebral vessels. P450 enzymes contain heme in their catalytic domain and nitric oxide (NO) appears to bind to these heme moieties and block formation of P450 products, including EETs. Thus, there appears to be crosstalk between P450 enzymes and NO/NO synthase. The role of fatty acid metabolites and cerebral blood flow becomes even more complex in light of data demonstrating that cyclooxygenase products can act as substrates for P450 enzymes.

49,debrisoquine,1131-64-2,34665.0,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Debrisoquine is an adrenergic neuron-blocking drug. Genetic and environmental factors are determinants of the interindividual and interethnic variability in drug metabolism. Thus, interethnic differences in debrisoquine hydroxylation polymorphism (Cytochrome p450, subfamily IID, polypeptide 6, CYP2D6) might be partly responsible for the variation in haloperidol disposition between races. The influence of tobacco, ethanol, caffeine, gender, and oral contraceptive use on the debrisoquine metabolic ratio (MR) has been analyzed in panels of healthy volunteers. About 5-10% of European white population has a genetically determinant defect of the CYP2D6, one of the enzymes of cytochrome P-450. This defect leads to the impaired metabolism of many drugs including various psychopharmacological agents. The measurement of the hydroxylation of debrisoquine is a laboratory test which allows identifying such an individual. Patients who show an impaired hydroxylation of debrisoquine usually demonstrate severe side effects and poor outcome of psychopharmacotherapy. In practice, knowledge of a patient's debrisoquine metabolic phenotype is an advantage when prescribing tricyclic antidepressants and neuroleptics, as the drug concentration will be considerably higher in slow metabolisers than in the average patient.

51,dmantipyrine,89-25-8,31530.0,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Demethylated antipyrine is a novel potent free radical scavenger that has been clinically used to reduce the neuronal damage following ischemic stroke. Demethylated antipyrine exerts neuroprotective effects by inhibiting endothelial injury and by ameliorating neuronal damage in brain ischemia. Demethylated antipyrine provides the desirable features of NOS: it increases eNOS (beneficial NOS for rescuing ischemic stroke) and decreases nNOS and iNOS (detrimental NOS). Post- reperfusion brain edema and hemorrhagic events induced by thrombolytic therapy may be reduced by demethylated antipyrine pretreatment. Increased productions of superoxide and NO in the brain after reperfusion and a concomitant surge in oxygen free radicals with increased NO during recirculation lead to formation of peroxynitrite, a super potent radical. Demethylated antipyrine, which inhibits oxidation and enhances NO production derived from increased eNOS expression, may improve and conserve cerebral blood flow without peroxynitrite generation during reperfusion. Clinical experience with demethylated antipyrine suggests that this drug has a wide therapeutic time window. Demethylated antipyrine can exert a wide range of inhibitory effects on water-soluble and lipid soluble peroxyl radical-induced peroxidation systems, and appears to display combined properties of both, vitamin C and E. Demethylated antipyrine can scavenge not only hydroxyl radicals but also other free radicals, although it has no major effect on superoxide anion radicals. Demethylated antipyrine apparently traps hydroxyl radicals and inhibits OH-dependent lipid peroxidation or tyrosine nitration induced by peroxynitrite (ONOO-). Lipid peroxidation starts with lipid radical (L) production after free radical-mediated extraction of proton from unsaturated fatty acid. Subsequently lipid peroxyl radical (LOO) is generated by addition of oxygen atom, and a further L is produced by LOO-mediated extraction of proton from another unsaturated fatty acid. Demethylated antipyrine can inhibit lipid peroxidation by scavenging not only hydroxyl radicals but also other free radicals including LOO. Under physiological conditions, 50% of demethylated antipyrine is present as an anion form, and electrons released from demethylated antipyrine anion exert radical scavenging. Subsequently, demethylated antipyrine radicals are generated. They react readily with oxygen atoms, and form peroxyl radical of demethylated antipyrine, and eventually 2-oxo-3-(phenylhydrazone)- butanoic acid (OPB).

Prostanoids are a subclass of the lipid mediator group known as eicosanoids. They derive from C-20 polyunsaturated fatty acids, mainly dihomo-gamma-linoleic (20:3n-6), arachidonic (20:4n-6), and eicosapentaenoic (20:5n-3) acids, through the action of cyclooxygenases-1 and -2 (COX-1 and COX-2). The reaction product of COX is the unstable endoperoxide prostaglandin H (PGH) that is further transformed into the individual prostanoids by a series of specific prostanoid synthases. Prostanoids are local-acting mediators formed and inactivated within the same or neighbouring cells prior to their release into circulation as inactive metabolites (15-keto- and 13,14-dihydroketo metabolites). Non-enzymatic peroxidation of arachidonic acid and other fatty acids in vivo can result in prostaglandin-like substances isomeric to the COX-derived prostaglandins that are termed isoprostanes. Prostanoids take part in many physiological and pathophysiological processes in practically every organ, tissue and cell, including the vascular, renal, gastrointestinal and reproductive systems. Their activities are mediated through prostanoid-specific receptors and intracellular signalling pathways, whilst their biosynthesis and action are blocked by nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID). Isoprostanes are considered to be reliable markers of oxidant stress status and have been linked to inflammation, ischaemia-reperfusion, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, reproductive disorders and diabetes. (PMID: 16986207, 6252026, 6952267, 4019112, 6945633Prostaglandins are eicosanoids. The eicosanoids consist of the prostaglandins (PGs), thromboxanes (TXs), leukotrienes (LTs) and lipoxins (LXs). The PGs and TXs are collectively identified as prostanoids. Prostaglandins were originally shown to be synthesized in the prostate gland, thromboxanes from platelets (thrombocytes) and leukotrienes from leukocytes, hence the derivation of their names. All mammalian cells except erythrocytes synthesize eicosanoids. These molecules are extremely potent, able to cause profound physiological effects at very dilute concentrations.

It is used for relief of symptoms of arthritis, primary dysmenorrhoea, and fever; Ibuprofen is an NSAID which is believed to work through inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX), thus inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis. There are at least 2 variations of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2), ibuprofen inhibits both COX-1 and COX-2. It appears that its analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory activity are achieved principally through COX-2 inhibition; whereas COX-1 inhibition is responsible for its unwanted effects on platelet aggregation and the GI mucosa. As with other NSAIDs, ibuprofen inhibits platelet aggregation, but is not used therapeutically for this action since it is a minor and reversible effect. -- Wikipedia.",Ibuprofen-R,HMDB0001925,,,C01588,,,,,"(+-)-2-(P-Isobutylphenyl)propionic acid***(+-)-alpha-Methyl-4-(2-methylpropyl)benzeneacetic acid***(+-)-Ibuprofen***(+-)-P-Isobutylhydratropic acid***(4-Isobutylphenyl)-alpha-methylacetic acid***(RS)-Ibuprofen***2-(4-Isobutylphenyl)propanoic acid***4-Isobutylhydratropic acid***Adran***Advil***alpha-(4-Isobutylphenyl)propionic acid***alpha-(P-Isobutylphenyl)propionic acid***Amibufen***Anco***Anflagen***Apsifen***Bluton***Brufen***Brufort***Buburone***Butylenin***Dolgin***Dolgirid***Dolgit***dolo-Dolgit***Ebufac***Epobron***Femadon***Haltran***Ibu-attritin***Ibumetin***Ibuprocin***Ibutid***Inabrin***Inoven***Lamidon***Lebrufen***Liptan***Medipren***Motrin***Mynosedin***Nobfen***Nobgen***Nuprin***Nurofen***Pediaprofen***Roidenin***Rufen***Seclodin***Suspren***Tabalon***Trendar***Urem***(+-)-2-(P-Isobutylphenyl)propionate***(+-)-a-Methyl-4-(2-methylpropyl)benzeneacetate***(+-)-a-Methyl-4-(2-methylpropyl)benzeneacetic acid***(+-)-alpha-Methyl-4-(2-methylpropyl)benzeneacetate***(+-)-α-methyl-4-(2-methylpropyl)benzeneacetate***(+-)-α-methyl-4-(2-methylpropyl)benzeneacetic acid***(+-)-P-Isobutylhydratropate***(4-Isobutylphenyl)-a-methylacetate***(4-Isobutylphenyl)-a-methylacetic acid***(4-Isobutylphenyl)-alpha-methylacetate***(4-Isobutylphenyl)-α-methylacetate***(4-Isobutylphenyl)-α-methylacetic acid***2-(4-Isobutylphenyl)propanoate***4-Isobutylhydratropate***a-(4-Isobutylphenyl)propionate***a-(4-Isobutylphenyl)propionic acid***alpha-(4-Isobutylphenyl)propionate***α-(4-isobutylphenyl)propionate***α-(4-isobutylphenyl)propionic acid***a-(P-Isobutylphenyl)propionate***a-(P-Isobutylphenyl)propionic acid***alpha-(P-Isobutylphenyl)propionate***α-(P-isobutylphenyl)propionate***α-(P-isobutylphenyl)propionic acid***alpha-P-Isobutylphenylpropionate***alpha-P-Isobutylphenylpropionic acid***Duralbuprofen***P-Isobutyl-2-phenylpropionate***P-Isobutyl-2-phenylpropionic acid***P-Isobutylhydratropate***P-Isobutylhydratropic acid***Calcium salt ibuprofen***Ibuprofen, copper (2+) salt***Ibuprofen, magnesium salt***Ibuprofen, zinc salt***Trauma dolgit gel***Aluminum salt ibuprofen***IP 82***Ibuprofen, aluminum salt***Ibuprofen-zinc***Magnesium salt ibuprofen***Salt ibuprofen, magnesium***Sodium salt ibuprofen***Zinc salt ibuprofen***I.V. solution, ibuprofen***IP-82***Ibuprofen i.v. solution***Ibuprofen, (+-)-isomer***Ibuprofen, (R)-isomer***Ibuprofen, (S)-isomer***Ibuprofen, calcium salt***Potassium salt ibuprofen***Salprofen***Salt ibuprofen, sodium***Salt ibuprofen, zinc***alpha-Methyl-4-(2-methylpropyl)benzeneacetic acid***Ibuprofen zinc***Ibuprofen, potassium salt***Ibuprofen, sodium salt***Trauma-dolgit gel***TraumaDolgit gel",5855,ibuprofen,A monocarboxylic acid that is propionic acid in which one of the hydrogens at position 2 is substituted by a 4-(2-methylpropyl)phenyl group.,"InChI=1S/C13H18O2/c1-9(2)8-11-4-6-12(7-5-11)10(3)13(14)15/h4-7,9-10H,8H2,1-3H3,(H,14,15)",Ibuprofen,KEGG COMPOUND accession,C01588

More specifically it is the C1-donor in the reactions catalyzed by thymidylate synthase and thymidylate synthase (FAD). It also acts as a coenzyme in the synthesis of serine from glycine via the enzyme serine hydroxymethyl transferase. 5,10-Methylene-THF is a substrate for Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase. This enzyme converts 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. This reaction is required for the multistep process that converts the amino acid homocysteine to methionine. The body uses methionine to make proteins and other important compounds. 5,10-CH2-THF is a substrate for many enzymes including Bifunctional methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase/cyclohydrolase (mitochondrial), Aminomethyltransferase (mitochondrial), Serine hydroxymethyltransferase (mitochondrial), Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, C-1-tetrahydrofolate synthase (cytoplasmic), Serine hydroxymethyltransferase (cytosolic) and Thymidylate synthase.","5,10-Methylene-THF",HMDB0001533,QYNUQALWYRSVHF-UEWDXFNNSA-L,"InChI=1S/C20H23N7O6/c21-20-24-16-15(18(31)25-20)27-9-26(8-12(27)7-22-16)11-3-1-10(2-4-11)17(30)23-13(19(32)33)5-6-14(28)29/h1-4,12-13H,5-9H2,(H,23,30)(H,28,29)(H,32,33)(H4,21,22,24,25,31)/p-2/t12-,13?/m0/s1",C00143,METHYLENE-THF,FDB022675,mlthf,[H]OC1=NC(=NC2=C1N1C([H])([H])N(C3=C([H])C([H])=C(C([H])=C3[H])C(=O)N([H])C([H])(C([O-])=O)C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([O-])=O)C([H])([H])[C@@]1([H])C([H])([H])N2[H])N([H])[H],"(6R)-5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate***(6R)-5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolic acid***5,10-Methenyltetrahydropteroylglutamate***5,10-Methylene-6-hydrofolate***5,10-Methylene-6-hydrofolic acid***5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate***5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolic acid***N5>,N10-methylenetetrahydrofolate***5,10-Methylene-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate***Tetrahydromethylenefolate***5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate, (D-glu)-isomer***CH2H4Folate***5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate monohydrochloride, (L-glu)-isomer***5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate, (L-glu)-(S)-isomer",1989,"(6R)-5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolic acid","The (6R)-stereoisomer of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolic acid.","InChI=1S/C20H23N7O6/c21-20-24-16-15(18(31)25-20)27-9-26(8-12(27)7-22-16)11-3-1-10(2-4-11)17(30)23-13(19(32)33)5-6-14(28)29/h1-4,12-13H,5-9H2,(H,23,30)(H,28,29)(H,32,33)(H4,21,22,24,25,31)/t12-,13+/m1/s1","5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate",KEGG COMPOUND accession,C00143

109,thf,135-16-0,20506.0,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Tetrahydrofolate is a soluble coenzyme (vitamin B9) that is synthesized de novo by plants and microorganisms, and absorbed from the diet by animals. It is composed of three distinct parts: a pterin ring, a p-ABA (p-aminobenzoic acid) and a polyglutamate chain with a number of residues varying between 1 and 8. Only the tetra-reduced form of the molecule serves as a coenzyme for C1 transfer reactions. In biological systems, the C1-units exist under various oxidation states and the different tetrahydrofolate derivatives constitute a family of related molecules named indistinctly under the generic term folate. (PMID 16042593). Folate is important for cells and tissues that rapidly divide. Cancer cells divide rapidly, and drugs that interfere with folate metabolism are used to treat cancer. Methotrexate is a drug often used to treat cancer because it inhibits the production of the active form, tetrahydrofolate. Unfortunately, methotrexate can be toxic, producing side effects such as inflammation in the digestive tract that make it difficult to eat normally. -- Wikipedia; Signs of folic acid deficiency are often subtle. Diarrhea, loss of appetite, and weight loss can occur. Additional signs are weakness, sore tongue, headaches, heart palpitations, irritability, and behavioral disorders. Women with folate deficiency who become pregnant are more likely to give birth to low birth weight and premature infants, and infants with neural tube defects. In adults, anemia is a sign of advanced folate deficiency. In infants and children, folate deficiency can slow growth rate. Some of these symptoms can also result from a variety of medical conditions other than folate deficiency. It is important to have a physician evaluate these symptoms so that appropriate medical care can be given. -- Wikipedia; Folinic acid is a form of folate that can help 'rescue' or reverse the toxic effects of methotrexate. Folinic acid is not the same as folic acid. Folic acid supplements have little established role in cancer chemotherapy. There have been cases of severe adverse effects of accidental substitution of folic acid for folinic acid in patients receiving methotrexate cancer chemotherapy. It is important for anyone receiving methotrexate to follow medical advice on the use of folic or folinic acid supplements. -- Wikipedia. Low concentrations of folate, vitamin B12, or vitamin B6 may increase the level of homocysteine, an amino acid normally found in blood. There is evidence that an elevated homocysteine level is an independent risk factor for heart disease and stroke. The evidence suggests that high levels of homocysteine may damage coronary arteries or make it easier for blood clotting cells called platelets to clump together and form a clot.

111,thmpp,154-87-0,9532.0,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Thiamine pyrophosphate is the active form of thiamine, and it serves as a cofactor for several enzymes involved primarily in carbohydrate catabolism. The enzymes are important in the biosynthesis of a number of cell constituents, including neurotransmitters, and for the production of reducing equivalents used in oxidant stress defenses and in biosyntheses and for synthesis of pentoses used as nucleic acid precursors. The chemical structure of TPP is that of an aromatic methylaminopyrimidine ring, linked via a methylene bridge to a methylthiazolium ring with a pyrophosphate group attached to a hydroxyethyl side chain. In non-enzymatic model studies it has been demonstrated that the thiazolium ring can catalyse reactions which are similar to those of TPP-dependent enzymes but several orders of magnitude slower. Using infrared and NMR spectrophotometry it has been shown that the dissociation of the proton from C2 of the thiazolium ring is necessary for catalysis; the abstraction of the proton leads to the formation of a carbanion (ylid) with the potential for a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl group of the substrate. In all TPP-dependent enzymes the abstraction of the proton from the C2 atom is the first step in catalysis, which is followed by a nucleophilic attack of this carbanion on the substrate. Subsequent cleavage of a C-C bond releases the first product with formation of a second carbanion (2-greek small letter alpha-carbanion or enamine). The formation of this 2-greek small letter alpha-carbanion is the second feature of TPP catalysis common to all TPP-dependent enzymes. Depending on the enzyme and the substrate(s), the reaction intermediates and products differ. Methyl-branched fatty acids, as phytanic acid, undergo peroxisomal beta-oxidation in which they are shortened by 1 carbon atom. This process includes four steps: activation, 2-hydroxylation, thiamine pyrophosphate dependent cleavage and aldehyde dehydrogenation. In the third step, 2-hydroxy-3-methylacyl-CoA is cleaved in the peroxisomal matrix by 2-hydroxyphytanoyl-CoA lyase (2-HPCL), which uses thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) as cofactor. The thiamine pyrophosphate dependence of the third step is unique in peroxisomal mammalian enzymology. Human pathology due to a deficient alpha-oxidation is mostly linked to mutations in the gene coding for the second enzyme of the sequence, phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase (EC 1.14.11.18).

6,HC02086,7091-44-3,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): PA(16:0/16:0) is a phosphatidic acid. It is a glycerophospholipid in which a phosphate moiety occupies a glycerol substitution site. As is the case with diacylglycerols, phosphatidic acids can have many different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached at the C-1 and C-2 positions. Fatty acids containing 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. PA(16:0/16:0), in particular, consists of one chain of palmitic acid at the C-1 position and one chain of palmitic acid at the C-2 position. The palmitic acid moiety is derived from fish oils, milk fats, vegetable oils and animal fats, while the palmitic acid moiety is derived from fish oils, milk fats, vegetable oils and animal fats. Phosphatidic acids are quite rare but are extremely important as intermediates in the biosynthesis of triacylglycerols and phospholipids. Indeed, the concentration of phosphatidic acids is often over-estimated in tissues and biofluids as it can arise by inadvertent enzymatic hydrolysis during inappropriate storage or extraction conditions during analysis. The main biosynthetic route of phosphatidic acid in animal tissues involves sequential acylation of alpha-glycerophosphate by acyl-CoA derivatives of fatty acids. PAs are biologically active lipids that can stimulate a large range of responses in many different cell types, such as platelet aggregation, smooth muscle contraction, in vivo vasoactive effects, chemotaxis, expression of adhesion molecules, increased tight junction permeability of endothelial cells, induction of stress fibres, modulation of cardiac contractility, and many others. Diacylglycerols (DAGs) can be converted to PAs by DAG kinases and indirect evidence supports the notion that PAs alter the excitability of neurons. Phospholipase Ds (PLDs), which catalyze the conversion of glycerolphospholipids, particularly phosphatidylcholine, to PAs and the conversion of N-arachidonoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE) to anandamide and PAs are activated by several inflammatory mediators including bradykinin, ATP and glutamate. PAs activate downstream signaling pathways such as PKCs and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), which are linked to an increase in sensitivity of sensory neurons either during inflammation or in chronic pain models.

9,M03116,,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Undecanoyl CoA is an acyl-CoA with the C-11 Acyl chain. Acyl-CoA (or formyl-CoA) is a coenzyme involved in the metabolism of fatty acids. It is a temporary compound formed when coenzyme A (CoA) attaches to the end of a long-chain fatty acid, inside living cells. The CoA is then removed from the chain, carrying two carbons from the chain with it, forming acetyl-CoA. This is then used in the citric acid cycle to start a chain of reactions, eventually forming many adenosine triphosphates. To be oxidatively degraded, a fatty acid must first be activated in a two-step reaction catalyzed by acyl-CoA synthetase. First, the fatty acid displaces the diphosphate group of ATP, then coenzyme A (HSCoA) displaces the AMP group to form an Acyl-CoA. The acyladenylate product of the first step has a large free energy of hydrolysis and conserves the free energy of the cleaved phosphoanhydride bond in ATP. The second step, transfer of the acyl group to CoA (the same molecule that carries acetyl groups as acetyl-CoA), conserves free energy in the formation of a thioester bond. Consequently, the overall reaction Fatty acid + CoA + ATP <=> Acyl-CoA + AMP + PPi has a free energy change near zero. Subsequent hydrolysis of the product PPi (by the enzyme inorganic pyrophosphatase) is highly exergonic, and this reaction makes the formation of acyl-CoA spontaneous and irreversible. Fatty acids are activated in the cytosol, but oxidation occurs in the mitochondria. Because there is no transport protein for CoA adducts, acyl groups must enter the mitochondria via a shuttle system involving the small molecule carnitine.",Undecanoyl-CoA,HMDB0013114,IZWCGXGZGYKDHR-WMMBNDHFSA-N,"InChI=1S/C32H56N7O17P3S/c1-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-11-12-23(41)60-16-15-34-22(40)13-14-35-30(44)27(43)32(2,3)18-53-59(50,51)56-58(48,49)52-17-21-26(55-57(45,46)47)25(42)31(54-21)39-20-38-24-28(33)36-19-37-29(24)39/h19-21,25-27,31,42-43H,4-18H2,1-3H3,(H,34,40)(H,35,44)(H,48,49)(H,50,51)(H2,33,36,37)(H2,45,46,47)/t21-,25-,26-,27?,31-/m1/s1",,,FDB029290,M03116,[H]OC([H])(C(=O)N([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C(=O)N([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])SC(=O)C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])[H])C(C([H])([H])[H])(C([H])([H])[H])C([H])([H])OP(=O)(O[H])OP(=O)(O[H])OC([H])([H])[C@@]1([H])O[C@@]([H])(N2C([H])=NC3=C2N=C([H])N=C3N([H])[H])[C@]([H])(O[H])[C@]1([H])OP(=O)(O[H])O[H],"2-Methyloctanoyl CoA, 21***2-Methyloctanoyl coenzyme A, 21",78176,undecanoyl-CoA,A medium-chain fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of undecanoic acid.,"InChI=1S/C32H56N7O17P3S/c1-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-11-12-23(41)60-16-15-34-22(40)13-14-35-30(44)27(43)32(2,3)18-53-59(50,51)56-58(48,49)52-17-21-26(55-57(45,46)47)25(42)31(54-21)39-20-38-24-28(33)36-19-37-29(24)39/h19-21,25-27,31,42-43H,4-18H2,1-3H3,(H,34,40)(H,35,44)(H,48,49)(H,50,51)(H2,33,36,37)(H2,45,46,47)/t21-,25-,26-,27+,31-/m1/s1",undecanoyl-coenzyme A,HMDB accession,HMDB0013114

10,g6p,56-73-5,4170.0,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Glucose 6 phosphate (alpha-D-glucose 6 phosphate or G6P) is the alpha-anomer of glucose-6-phosphate. There are two anomers of glucose 6 phosphate, the alpha anomer and the beta anomer. Glucose 6 phosphate is an ester of glucose with phosphoric acid, made in the course of glucose metabolism by mammalian and other cells. It is a normal constituent of resting muscle and probably is in constant equilibrium with fructose-6-phosphate. (Stedman, 26th ed). Glucose-6-phosphate is a phosphorylated glucose molecule on carbon 6. When glucose enters a cell, it is immediately phosphorylated to G6P. This is catalyzed with hexokinase enzymes, thus consuming one ATP. A major reason for immediate phosphorylation of the glucose is so that it cannot diffuse out of the cell. The phosphorylation adds a charged group so the G6P cannot easily cross cell membranes. G6P can travel down two metabolic pathways, glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway. In addition to the metabolic pathways, G6P can also be stored as glycogen in the liver if blood glucose levels are high. If the body needs energy or carbon skeletons for syntheses, G6P can be isomerized to Fructose-6-phosphate and then phosphorylated to Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. Note, the molecule now has 2 phosphoryl groups attached. The addition of the 2nd phosphoryl group is an irreversible step, so once this happens G6P will enter glycolysis and be turned into pyruvate (ATP production occurs). If blood glucose levels are high, the body needs a way to store the excess glucose. After being converted to G6P, phosphoglucose mutase (isomerase) can turn the molecule into glucose-1-phosphate. Glucose-1-phosphate can then be combined with uridine triphosphate (UTP) to form UDP-glucose. This reaction is driven by the hydrolysis of pyrophosphate that is released in the reaction. Now, the activated UDP-glucose can add to a growing glycogen molecule with the help of glycogen synthase. This is a very efficient storage mechanism for glucose since it costs the body only 1 ATP to store the 1 glucose molecule and virtually no energy to remove it from storage. It is important to note that glucose-6-phosphate is an allosteric activator of glycogen synthase, which makes sense because when the level of glucose is high the body should store the excess glucose as glycogen. On the other hand, glycogen synthase is inhibited when it is phosphorylated by protein kinase a during times of high stress or low blood glucose levels. -- Wikipedia.",Glucose 6-phosphate,HMDB0001401,NBSCHQHZLSJFNQ-GASJEMHNSA-L,"InChI=1S/C6H13O9P/c7-3-2(1-14-16(11,12)13)15-6(10)5(9)4(3)8/h2-10H,1H2,(H2,11,12,13)/p-2/t2-,3-,4+,5-,6?/m1/s1",C00092,GLC-6-P,FDB021818,g6p,[H]OC1([H])O[C@]([H])(C([H])([H])OP([O-])([O-])=O)[C@@]([H])(O[H])[C@]([H])(O[H])[C@@]1([H])O[H],6-O-phosphono-D-Glucopyranose***D-Glucose 6-phosphate***GLC6p***Robison ester***Glucose 6-phosphoric acid***D-Glucose 6-phosphoric acid***a-D-Glucose 6- phosphate***alpha-D-Glucose 6- phosphate***alpha-D-Glucose 6-phosphate***alpha-D-Hexose 6-phosphate***D(+)-Glucopyranose 6-phosphate***D-Glucose-6-dihydrogen phosphate***D-Hexose 6-phosphate***Glucose-6-phosphate,4170,D-glucopyranose 6-phosphate,A glucopyranose ring with a phosphate replacing the hydroxy in the hydroxymethyl group at position 6.,"InChI=1S/C6H13O9P/c7-3-2(1-14-16(11,12)13)15-6(10)5(9)4(3)8/h2-10H,1H2,(H2,11,12,13)/t2-,3-,4+,5-,6?/m1/s1",D-Glucose 6-phosphate,CAS Registry Number,56-73-5

13,lac_L,79-33-4,422.0,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Lactic acid is an organic acid. It is a chiral molecule, consisting of two optical isomers, L-lactic acid and D-lactic acid, with the L-isomer being the most common in living organisms. Lactic acid plays a role in several biochemical processes and is produced in the muscles during intense activity. In animals, L-lactate is constantly produced from pyruvate via the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in a process of fermentation during normal metabolism and exercise. It does not increase in concentration until the rate of lactate production exceeds the rate of lactate removal. This is governed by a number of factors, including monocarboxylate transporters, lactate concentration, the isoform of LDH, and oxidative capacity of tissues. The concentration of blood lactate is usually 1-2 mmol/L at rest, but can rise to over 20 mmol/L during intense exertion. There are some indications that lactate, and not glucose, is preferentially metabolized by neurons in the brain of several mammalian species, including mice, rats, and humans. Glial cells, using the lactate shuttle, are responsible for transforming glucose into lactate, and for providing lactate to the neurons. Lactate measurement in critically ill patients has been traditionally used to stratify patients with poor outcomes. However, plasma lactate levels are the result of a finely tuned interplay of factors that affect the balance between its production and its clearance. When the oxygen supply does not match its consumption, organisms adapt in many different ways, up to the point when energy failure occurs. Lactate, being part of the adaptive response, may then be used to assess the severity of the supply/demand imbalance. In such a scenario, the time to intervention becomes relevant: early and effective treatment may allow tissues and cells to revert to a normal state, as long as the oxygen machinery (i.e. mitochondria) is intact. Conversely, once the mitochondria are deranged, energy failure occurs even in the presence of normoxia. The lactate increase in critically ill patients may, therefore, be viewed as an early marker of a potentially reversible state (PMID: 16356243). When present in sufficiently high levels, lactic acid can act as an oncometabolite, an immunosuppressant, an acidogen, and a metabotoxin. An oncometabolite is a compound that promotes tumor growth and survival. An immunosuppressant reduces or arrests the activity of the immune system. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of lactic acid are associated with at least a dozen inborn errors of metabolism, including 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyryl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, biotinidase deficiency, fructose-1,6-diphosphatase deficiency, glycogen storage disease type 1A (GSD1A) or Von Gierke disease, glycogenosis type IB, glycogenosis type IC, glycogenosis type VI, Hers disease, lactic acidemia, Leigh syndrome, methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency, pyruvate decarboxylase E1 component deficiency, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency, pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, and short chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (SCAD deficiency). Locally high concentrations of lactic acid or lactate are found near many tumors due to the upregulation of lactate dehydrogenase (PMID: 15279558). Lactic acid produced by tumors through aerobic glycolysis acts as an immunosuppressant and tumor promoter (PMID: 23729358). Indeed, lactic acid has been found to be a key player or regulator in the development and malignant progression of a variety of cancers (PMID: 22084445). A number of studies have demonstrated that malignant transformation is associated with an increase in aerobic cellular lactate excretion. Lactate concentrations in various carcinomas (e.g. uterine cervix, head and neck, colorectal region) at first diagnosis of the disease, can be relatively low or extremely high (up to 40 µmol/g) in different individual tumors or within the same lesion (PMID: 15279558). High molar concentrations of lactate are correlated with a high incidence of distant metastasis. Low lactate tumors (< median of approximately 8 µmol/g) are associated with both an overall longer and disease-free survival compared to high lactate lesions (lactate > approximately 8 µmol/g). Lactate-induced secretion of hyaluronan by tumor-associated fibroblasts creates a milieu favourable for cell migration and metastases (PMID: 22084445). An acidic environment (pH 6-6.5), which is common in many tumors, allows tumor cells to evade the immune response, and therefore allows them to grow unchecked. Locally high concentrations of lactic acid are known to markedly impede the function of normal immune cells and will lead to a loss of T-cell function of human tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (PMID: 22084445). Lactic acid is also an organic acid and acts as a general acidogen. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart abnormalities, kidney abnormalities, liver damage, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of the untreated IEMs mentioned above.

20,Nacasp,997-55-7,21547.0,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): N-Acetylaspartic acid is a derivative of aspartic acid. It is the second most concentrated molecule in the brain after the amino acid glutamate. It is synthesized in neurons from the amino acid aspartate and acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl CoA). The various functions served by N-acetylaspartic acid are still under investigation, but the primary proposed functions include (1) acting as a neuronal osmolyte that is involved in fluid balance in the brain, (2) serving as a source of acetate for lipid and myelin synthesis in oligodendrocytes (the glial cells that myelinate neuronal axons), (3) serving as a precursor for the synthesis of the important dipeptide neurotransmitter N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG), and (4) playing a potential role in energy production from the amino acid glutamate in neuronal mitochondria. High neurotransmitter levels can lead to abnormal neural signaling, delayed or arrested intellectual development, and difficulties with general motor skills. When present in sufficiently high levels, N-acetylaspartic acid can be a neurotoxin, an acidogen, and a metabotoxin. A neurotoxin is a compound that disrupts or attacks neural tissue. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of N-acetylaspartic acid are associated with Canavan disease. N-acetylaspartic acid is an organic acid. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis.

Cytochrome P450 enzymes of the 4A and 4F families catalyze the omega-hydroxylation of arachidonic acid and produce 20-HETE. 20-HETE is a potent constrictor or renal, cerebral and mesenteric arteries. The vasoconstrictor response to 20-HETE is associated with activation of protein kinase, Rho kinase and the mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway C. 20-HETE also increases intracellular Ca2+ by causing the depolarization of vascular smooth muscle membrane secondary to blocking the large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+-channels and by a direct effect on L-type Ca channels. Elevations in the production of 20-HETE mediate the myogenic response of skeletal, renal and cerebral arteries to elevations in transmural pressure. There is an important interaction between nitric oxide (NO) and the formation of 20-HETE production. NO inhibits the formation of 20-HETE formation in renal and cerebral arteries and that a fall in levels of 20-HETE contributes the cyclic GMP-independent dilator effect of NO to activate the large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+-channels and to dilate the cerebral arteries.
