Thiamine triphosphate (ThTP) was previously considered to be a specific neuroactive form of thiamine. However, it was recently shown that ThTP exists in bacteria, fungi, plants and animals suggesting a much more general cellular role. In particular, it seems to play a role in response to amino acid starvation. In mammals, ThTP is hydrolyzed by a specific thiamine triphosphatase. In Leigh's disease, this compound is present in decreased amounts in the brain due to a metabolic block in its formation.",Thiamine triphosphate,HMDB0001512,b,b,C03028,CPD-611,FDB022666,thmtp,[H]N([H])C1=C(C([H])=NC(=N1)C([H])([H])[H])C([H])([H])[N+]1=C([H])SC(=C1C([H])([H])[H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])OP([O-])(=O)OP([O-])(=O)OP([O-])([O-])=O,IWLROWZYZPNOFC-UHFFFAOYSA-K,"InChI=1S/C12H19N4O10P3S/c1-8-11(30-7-16(8)6-10-5-14-9(2)15-12(10)13)3-4-24-28(20,21)26-29(22,23)25-27(17,18)19/h5,7H,3-4,6H2,1-2H3,(H5-,13,14,15,17,18,19,20,21,22,23)/p-3"
