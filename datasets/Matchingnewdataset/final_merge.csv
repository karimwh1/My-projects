It is a highly potent endogenous agonist of the cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors. CB1 receptors are predominantly found in the central nervous system (CNS) where they mainly mediate the psychotropic effects of Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and endocannabinoids, whereas the expression of the CB2 receptor is thought to be restricted to cells of the immune system. Anandamide plays a role in the regulation of feeding behavior, and the neural generation of motivation and pleasure. Interestingly anandamide is also found in chocolate, which may help to explain some of its pleasurable effects (PMID: 8751435). Anandamide is also important for implantation of the early stage embryo in its blastocyst form into the uterus. As a result, anandamide has been proposed as a biomarker of infertility, but so far lacks any predictive values in order to be used clinically. High fat diets increase the level of anandamide in the liver and so ananamide may also play a role in the development of obesity Endogenous anandamide is present at very low levels and has a very short half-life due to the action of the enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), which breaks AEA down into free arachidonic acid and ethanolamine. The analgesic effects of acetaminophen may be explained by anandamide. Acetaminophen is metabolically combined with arachidonic acid by FAAH to form AM404 (PMID 15987694). This metabolite of acetaminophen is a potent agonist for the TRPV1 vanilloid receptor, a weak agonist at both CB1 and CB2 receptors, and an inhibitor of anandamide reuptake. As a result, anandamide levels in the body and brain are elevated. In effect, acetaminophen acts as a pro-drug for a cannabimimetic metabolite. AEA has been shown to inhibit breast cell cancer proliferation (PMID 9653194). It might inhibit tumor cell proliferation or induce apoptosis via interaction with the type 1 vanilloid receptor (TRPV1). TRPV1 is an ion channel expressed almost exclusively by sensory neurons, activated by pH, noxious heat (>48 degrees centigrade) and plant toxins and is thought to play an important role in nociception. Cervical cancer cells are sensitive to AEA-induced apoptosis via TRPV1 that is aberrantly expressed in vitro and in vivo while CB1 and CB2 receptors play a protective role.

Therefore it is referred to as an aldohexose. The glucose molecule can exist in an open-chain (acyclic) and ring (cyclic) form, the latter being the result of an intramolecular reaction between the aldehyde C atom and the C-5 hydroxyl group to form an intramolecular hemiacetal. In water solution both forms are in equilibrium and at pH 7 the cyclic one is the predominant. Glucose is the primary source of energy for living organisms. It is naturally occurring and is found in fruits and other parts of plants in its free state. Glucose is mainly made by plants and most algae during photosynthesis from water and carbon dioxide, using energy from sunlight, where it is used to make cellulose in cell walls. However, most glucose does not occur in its free form, but in the form of its polymers, i.e. lactose, sucrose, starch and glycogen which are energy reserve substances, and cellulose and chitin, which are components of the cell wall in plants or fungi and arthropods, respectively. In animals, glucose arises from the breakdown of glycogen in a process known as glycogenolysis. Glucose can be synthesized in the liver and kidneys from non-carbohydrate intermediates, such as pyruvate and glycerol, by a process known as gluconeogenesis. Ingested glucose initially binds to the receptor for sweet taste on the tongue in humans. This complex of the proteins T1R2 and T1R3 makes it possible to identify glucose-containing food sources. Glucose mainly comes from food - about 300 g per day are produced by conversion of carbohydrates to glucose. In order to get into or out of cell membranes of cells and membranes of cell compartments, glucose requires special transport proteins including GLUT1, GLUT2 and GLUT3 which are expressed in different cells and tissues. In humans, glucose is metabolised by glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway. It can also be fermented by bacteria in the gut. Glucose is a ubiquitous fuel in biology. It is used as an energy source in organisms, from bacteria to humans, through either aerobic respiration, anaerobic respiration (in bacteria), or fermentation. Glucose is the human body's key source of energy, through aerobic respiration, providing about 3.75 kilocalories (16 kilojoules) of food energy per gram. Glucose supplies almost all the energy for the brain. The blood sugar content of a healthy person in the short-time fasting state, e.g. after overnight fasting, is about 70 to 100 mg/dL of blood (4 to 5.5 mM). In blood plasma, the measured values are about 10–15% higher.  Dysregulated metabolism of glucose can lead to a number of diseases including diabetes. Diabetes is a metabolic disorder where the body is unable to regulate levels of glucose in the blood either because of a lack of insulin in the body or the failure, by cells in the body, to respond properly to insulin. Each of these situations can be caused by persistently high elevations of blood glucose levels, through pancreatic burnout and insulin resistance.",MDB00000074,,

Oxytocin and vasopressin are the only known hormones released by the human posterior pituitary gland to act at a distance. In women, it is released mainly after distention of the cervix and vagina during labor, and after stimulation of the nipples, facilitating birth and breastfeeding, respectively. Oxytocin is released during orgasm in both sexes. In the brain, oxytocin is involved in social recognition and bonding, and might be involved in the formation of trust between people. In the pituitary gland, oxytocin is packaged in large, dense-core vesicles, where it is bound to neurophysin as shown in the inset of the figure; neurophysin is a large peptide fragment of the giant precursor protein molecule from which oxytocin is derived by enzymatic cleavage. One international unit (IU) of oxytocin is the equivalent of about 2 micrograms of pure peptide. The actions of oxytocin are mediated by specific, high affinity oxytocin receptors. The oxytocin receptor is a G-protein-coupled receptor which requires Mg2+ and cholesterol. It belongs to the rhodopsin-type (class I) group of G-protein-coupled receptors. Synthetic oxytocin is sold as medication under the trade names Pitocin and Syntocinon and also as generic oxytocin.

Liothyronine is the manufactured form of T3. Triiodothyronine is a thyroid hormone normally synthesized and secreted by the thyroid gland in much smaller quantities than thyroxine (T4). Most T3 is derived from peripheral monodeiodination of T4 at the 5' position of the outer ring of the iodothyronine nucleus.  Triiodothyronine or T3 is one of two major hormones derived from the thyroid gland, the other being thyroxine (T4). The major form of thyroid hormone in the blood is thyroxine (T4), which has a longer half-life than T3. In humans, the ratio of T4 to T3 released into the blood is approximately 14:1. T4 is converted to the active T3 (three to four times more potent than T4) within cells by deiodinases (5′-iodinase). Thyroid hormones function via a well-studied set of nuclear receptors, termed the thyroid hormone receptors. They act on nearly every cell in the body. In particular, thyroid hormones act to increase the basal metabolic rate, affect protein synthesis, help regulate long bone growth (synergy with growth hormone) and neural maturation, and increase the body's sensitivity to catecholamines (such as adrenaline) by permissiveness.

It was first identified in 1984 by Serhan and colleagues as 5-lipoxygenase interaction product (a lipoxin) of activated leukocytes. Initially, two lipoxins were identified, lipoxin A4 (LXA4) and LXB4, but more recent studies have identified epimers of these two LXs: the epi-lipoxins, 15-epi-LXA4 and 15-epi-LXB4 respectively. Endogenous transcellular biosynthesis of LXA4 occurs via interaction of leukocytes with epithelium, endothelium or platelets. Lipoxins (LXs) or the lipoxygenase interaction products are generated from arachidonic acid via sequential actions of lipoxygenases and subsequent reactions to give specific trihydroxytetraene-containing eicosanoids. These unique structures are formed during cell-cell interactions and appear to act at both temporal and spatially distinct sites from other eicosanoids produced during the course of inflammatory responses and to stimulate natural resolution. Lipoxin A4 (LXA4) and lipoxin B4 (LXB4) are positional isomers that each possesses potent cellular and in vivo actions. These LX structures are conserved across species. The results of numerous studies confirm that they are the first recognized eicosanoid chemical mediators that display both potent anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving actions in vivo in disease models that include rabbit, rat, and mouse systems. LXs act at specific GPCRs as agonists to regulate cellular responses of interest in inflammation and resolution. Aspirin has a direct impact in the LX circuit by triggering the biosynthesis of endogenous epimers of LX, termed the aspirin-triggered 15-epi-LX, that share the potent anti-inflammatory actions of LX.

Primary and secondary bile acids help the body digest fats. Ursodeoxycholic acid, which is a secondary bile acid helps regulate cholesterol by reducing the rate at which the intestine absorbs cholesterol molecules while breaking up micelles containing cholesterol. UDCA was first found in bear bile and is apparently either a precursor or a product of chenodeoxycholate. UDCA is used as a drug. Its administration changes the composition of bile and may dissolve gallstones. It is used as a cholagogue and choleretic.

It is a chiral molecule, consisting of two optical isomers, L-lactic acid and D-lactic acid, with the L-isomer being the most common in living organisms. Lactic acid plays a role in several biochemical processes and is produced in the muscles during intense activity. In animals, L-lactate is constantly produced from pyruvate via the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in a process of fermentation during normal metabolism and exercise. It does not increase in concentration until the rate of lactate production exceeds the rate of lactate removal. This is governed by a number of factors, including monocarboxylate transporters, lactate concentration, the isoform of LDH, and oxidative capacity of tissues. The concentration of blood lactate is usually 1000-2000 μM at rest, but can rise to over 20000 μM  during intense exertion. There are some indications that lactate, and not glucose, is preferentially metabolized by neurons in the brain of several mammalian species, including mice, rats, and humans. Glial cells, using the lactate shuttle, are responsible for transforming glucose into lactate, and for providing lactate to the neurons. Lactate measurement in critically ill patients has been traditionally used to stratify patients with poor outcomes. However, plasma lactate levels are the result of a finely tuned interplay of factors that affect the balance between its production and its clearance. When the oxygen supply does not match its consumption, organisms adapt in many different ways, up to the point when energy failure occurs. Lactate, being part of the adaptive response, may then be used to assess the severity of the supply/demand imbalance. In such a scenario, the time to intervention becomes relevant: early and effective treatment may allow tissues and cells to revert to a normal state, as long as the oxygen machinery (i.e. mitochondria) is intact. Conversely, once the mitochondria are deranged, energy failure occurs even in the presence of normoxia. The lactate increase in critically ill patients may, therefore, be viewed as an early marker of a potentially reversible state (PMID: 16356243 ). When present in sufficiently high levels, lactic acid can act as an oncometabolite, an immunosuppressant, an acidogen, and a metabotoxin. An oncometabolite is a compound that promotes tumor growth and survival. An immunosuppressant reduces or arrests the activity of the immune system. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of lactic acid are associated with at least a dozen inborn errors of metabolism, including 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyryl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, biotinidase deficiency, fructose-1,6-diphosphatase deficiency, glycogen storage disease type 1A (GSD1A) or Von Gierke disease, glycogenosis type IB, glycogenosis type IC, glycogenosis type VI, Hers disease, lactic acidemia, Leigh syndrome, methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency, pyruvate decarboxylase E1 component deficiency, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency, pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, and short chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (SCAD deficiency). Locally high concentrations of lactic acid or lactate are found near many tumors due to the upregulation of lactate dehydrogenase (PMID: 15279558 ). Lactic acid produced by tumors through aerobic glycolysis acts as an immunosuppressant and tumor promoter (PMID: 23729358 ). Indeed, lactic acid has been found to be a key player or regulator in the development and malignant progression of a variety of cancers (PMID: 22084445 ). A number of studies have demonstrated that malignant transformation is associated with an increase in aerobic cellular lactate excretion. Lactate concentrations in various carcinomas (e.g. uterine cervix, head and neck, colorectal region) at first diagnosis of the disease, can be relatively low or extremely high (up to 40 µmol/g) in different individual tumors or within the same lesion (PMID: 15279558 ). High molar concentrations of lactate are correlated with a high incidence of distant metastasis. Low lactate tumors (< median of approximately 8 µmol/g) are associated with both an overall longer and disease-free survival compared to high lactate lesions (lactate > approximately 8 µmol/g). Lactate-induced secretion of hyaluronan by tumor-associated fibroblasts creates a milieu favorable for cell migration and metastases (PMID: 22084445 ). An acidic environment (pH 6-6.5), which is common in many tumors, allows tumor cells to evade the immune response, and therefore allows them to grow unchecked. Locally high concentrations of lactic acid are known to markedly impede the function of normal immune cells and will lead to a loss of T-cell function of human tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (PMID: 22084445 ). Lactic acid is also an organic acid and acts as a general acidogen. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart abnormalities, kidney abnormalities, liver damage, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of the untreated IEMs mentioned above. Many affected children with organic acidemias experience intellectual disability or delayed development. Lactic acid is also a microbial metabolite, urinary lactic acid is produced by Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Enterobacter, Acinetobacter, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter frundii, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus group B, Staphylococcus saprophyticus (PMID: 22292465 ), Bacillus, Corynebacterium, Rhizopus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (PMID: 26360870).",MDB00000118,,

It is a highly potent endogenous agonist of the cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors. CB1 receptors are predominantly found in the central nervous system (CNS) where they mainly mediate the psychotropic effects of Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and endocannabinoids, whereas the expression of the CB2 receptor is thought to be restricted to cells of the immune system. Anandamide plays a role in the regulation of feeding behavior, and the neural generation of motivation and pleasure. Interestingly anandamide is also found in chocolate, which may help to explain some of its pleasurable effects (PMID: 8751435). Anandamide is also important for implantation of the early stage embryo in its blastocyst form into the uterus. As a result, anandamide has been proposed as a biomarker of infertility, but so far lacks any predictive values in order to be used clinically. High fat diets increase the level of anandamide in the liver and so ananamide may also play a role in the development of obesity Endogenous anandamide is present at very low levels and has a very short half-life due to the action of the enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), which breaks AEA down into free arachidonic acid and ethanolamine. The analgesic effects of acetaminophen may be explained by anandamide. Acetaminophen is metabolically combined with arachidonic acid by FAAH to form AM404 (PMID 15987694). This metabolite of acetaminophen is a potent agonist for the TRPV1 vanilloid receptor, a weak agonist at both CB1 and CB2 receptors, and an inhibitor of anandamide reuptake. As a result, anandamide levels in the body and brain are elevated. In effect, acetaminophen acts as a pro-drug for a cannabimimetic metabolite. AEA has been shown to inhibit breast cell cancer proliferation (PMID 9653194). It might inhibit tumor cell proliferation or induce apoptosis via interaction with the type 1 vanilloid receptor (TRPV1). TRPV1 is an ion channel expressed almost exclusively by sensory neurons, activated by pH, noxious heat (>48 degrees centigrade) and plant toxins and is thought to play an important role in nociception. Cervical cancer cells are sensitive to AEA-induced apoptosis via TRPV1 that is aberrantly expressed in vitro and in vivo while CB1 and CB2 receptors play a protective role.

Therefore it is referred to as an aldohexose. The glucose molecule can exist in an open-chain (acyclic) and ring (cyclic) form, the latter being the result of an intramolecular reaction between the aldehyde C atom and the C-5 hydroxyl group to form an intramolecular hemiacetal. In water solution both forms are in equilibrium and at pH 7 the cyclic one is the predominant. Glucose is the primary source of energy for living organisms. It is naturally occurring and is found in fruits and other parts of plants in its free state. Glucose is mainly made by plants and most algae during photosynthesis from water and carbon dioxide, using energy from sunlight, where it is used to make cellulose in cell walls. However, most glucose does not occur in its free form, but in the form of its polymers, i.e. lactose, sucrose, starch and glycogen which are energy reserve substances, and cellulose and chitin, which are components of the cell wall in plants or fungi and arthropods, respectively. In animals, glucose arises from the breakdown of glycogen in a process known as glycogenolysis. Glucose can be synthesized in the liver and kidneys from non-carbohydrate intermediates, such as pyruvate and glycerol, by a process known as gluconeogenesis. Ingested glucose initially binds to the receptor for sweet taste on the tongue in humans. This complex of the proteins T1R2 and T1R3 makes it possible to identify glucose-containing food sources. Glucose mainly comes from food - about 300 g per day are produced by conversion of carbohydrates to glucose. In order to get into or out of cell membranes of cells and membranes of cell compartments, glucose requires special transport proteins including GLUT1, GLUT2 and GLUT3 which are expressed in different cells and tissues. In humans, glucose is metabolised by glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway. It can also be fermented by bacteria in the gut. Glucose is a ubiquitous fuel in biology. It is used as an energy source in organisms, from bacteria to humans, through either aerobic respiration, anaerobic respiration (in bacteria), or fermentation. Glucose is the human body's key source of energy, through aerobic respiration, providing about 3.75 kilocalories (16 kilojoules) of food energy per gram. Glucose supplies almost all the energy for the brain. The blood sugar content of a healthy person in the short-time fasting state, e.g. after overnight fasting, is about 70 to 100 mg/dL of blood (4 to 5.5 mM). In blood plasma, the measured values are about 10–15% higher.  Dysregulated metabolism of glucose can lead to a number of diseases including diabetes. Diabetes is a metabolic disorder where the body is unable to regulate levels of glucose in the blood either because of a lack of insulin in the body or the failure, by cells in the body, to respond properly to insulin. Each of these situations can be caused by persistently high elevations of blood glucose levels, through pancreatic burnout and insulin resistance.",MDB00000074,"1S/C6H12O6/c7-1-2-3(8)4(9)5(10)6(11)12-2/h2-11H,1H2/t2-,3-,4+,5-,6?/m1/s1",WQZGKKKJIJFFOK-GASJEMHNSA-N

Most T3 is derived from peripheral monodeiodination of T4 at the 5' position of the outer ring of the iodothyronine nucleus.  Triiodothyronine or T3 is one of two major hormones derived from the thyroid gland, the other being thyroxine (T4). The major form of thyroid hormone in the blood is thyroxine (T4), which has a longer half-life than T3. In humans, the ratio of T4 to T3 released into the blood is approximately 14:1. T4 is converted to the active T3 (three to four times more potent than T4) within cells by deiodinases (5′-iodinase). Thyroid hormones function via a well-studied set of nuclear receptors, termed the thyroid hormone receptors. They act on nearly every cell in the body. In particular, thyroid hormones act to increase the basal metabolic rate, affect protein synthesis, help regulate long bone growth (synergy with growth hormone) and neural maturation, and increase the body's sensitivity to catecholamines (such as adrenaline) by permissiveness.
