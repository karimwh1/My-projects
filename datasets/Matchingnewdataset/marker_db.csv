0,1-Methylhistidine,"1-Methylhistidine, also known as 1-MHis or 1MH, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as histidine and derivatives. 1MH is also classified as a methylamino acid. Methylamino acids are primarily proteogenic amino acids (found in proteins) which have been methylated (in situ) on their side chains by various methyltransferase enzymes. Histidine can be methylated at either the N1 or N3 position of its imidazole ring, yielding the isomers 1-methylhistidine (1MH; also referred to as pi-methylhistidine) or 3-methylhistidine (3MH; tau-methylhistidine), respectively. There is considerable confusion with regard to the nomenclature of the methylated nitrogen atoms on the imidazole ring of histidine and other histidine-containing peptides such as anserine. In particular, older literature (mostly prior to the year 2000) designated anserine (Npi methylated) as beta-alanyl-N1-methyl-histidine, whereas according to standard IUPAC nomenclature, anserine is correctly named as beta-alanyl-N3-methyl-histidine. As a result, many papers published prior to the year 2000 incorrectly identified 1MH as a specific marker for dietary consumption or various pathophysiological effects when they really were referring to 3MH (PMID: 24137022 ). Recent discoveries have shown that 1MH is produced in essentially all mammals (and other vertebrates) via the enzyme known as METTL9 (PMID: 33563959 ). METTL9 is a broad-specific methyltransferase that mediates the formation of the majority of 1MH present in mammalian proteomes. METTL9-catalyzed methylation requires a His-x-His (HxH) motif, where ""x"" is a small amino acid. This HxH motif is found in a number of abundant mammalian proteins such as ARMC6, S100A9, and NDUFV3 (PMID: 33563959 ). Because of its abundance in many muscle-related proteins, 1MH has been found to be a good biomarker for the consumption of meat (PMID: 21527577 ). Dietary studies have shown that poultry consumption (p-trend = 0.0006) and chicken consumption (p-trend = 0.0003) are associated with increased levels of 1MH in human plasma (PMID: 30018457 ). The consumption of fish, especially salmon and cod, has also been shown to increase the levels of 1MH in serum and urine (PMID: 31401679 ). As a general rule, urinary 1MH is associated with white meat intake (p< 0.001), whereas urinary 3MH is associated with red meat intake (p< 0.001) (PMID: 34091671 ). 1-Methylhistidine as been found to be associated with chronic kidney disease where higher the N-acetyl-1-methylhistidine levels, the lower the estimated glomerular filtration rate and this is seen at a concentration of 85.5 (17.7-153.8) umol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 10838467). It is also an indicator of early-onset preeclampsia in the first-trimester in pregnant women (PMID: 22494326) and this is seen as a significant increase in its concentration in blood from a normal concentration of 12.7 (9.8-15.6) uM to an abnormal concentration of 50.0 (44.2-55.8) uM. 1-Methylhistidine is also involved in other conditions such as late-onset preeclampsia (PMID: 23159745), obesity (PMID: 15899597) and Alzheimer’s disease (PMID : 17031479) where it is found to be elevated in blood in individuats with late-onset preeclampsia and Alzheimer’s disease and elevated in urine in obese individuals.",HMDB0000001,CN1C=NC(C[C@H](N)C(O)=O)=C1,C7H11N3O2,"1S/C7H11N3O2/c1-10-3-5(9-4-10)2-6(8)7(11)12/h3-4,6H,2,8H2,1H3,(H,11,12)/t6-/m0/s1",BRMWTNUJHUMWMS-LURJTMIESA-N,2-amino-3-(1-methyl-1H-imidazol-4-yl)propanoic acid hydrate,-3.0704187479965057,,169.1811,169.085126611,6.93e+00 g/l,-2.95,-1.39,4,2,3,81.14,42.39,17.096998267038032,4-methyl-histidine hydrate,0,0,9.2503166513801,1.9645875066516765,1,1,1,0,0,0,MDB00000001,"5184,5199,5206,5236,5288,5291,5313,5338,5440,5441"

It is a polyamine that is normally quite toxic if swallowed, inhaled or absorbed through the skin. It is a catabolic byproduct of spermidine. It is also a precursor in the enzymatic synthesis of beta-alanine. 1,3-Diaminopropane is involved in the arginine/proline metabolic pathways and the beta-alanine metabolic pathway. 1,3-Diaminopropane was first detected in the urine of patients suffering from cystinuria and cystinlysinuria in 1971 (PMID: 5096953).",HMDB0000002,NCCCN,C3H10N2,1S/C3H10N2/c4-2-1-3-5/h1-5H2,XFNJVJPLKCPIBV-UHFFFAOYSA-N,"propane-1,3-diamine",-1.362482935,,74.1249,74.08439833,4.37e+02 g/l,-1.41,0.77,2,2,2,52.04,22.734,9.059383875573538,"α,ω-propanediamine",0,2,10.169241483553524,,1,0,1,0,0,0,MDB00000002,5300
2,2-Hydroxybutyric acid,"2-Hydroxybutyric acid (CAS: 600-15-7), also known as alpha-hydroxybutyrate, is an organic acid derived from alpha-ketobutyrate. alpha-Ketobutyrate is produced by amino acid catabolism (threonine and methionine) and glutathione anabolism (cysteine formation pathway) and is metabolized into propionyl-CoA and carbon dioxide (PMID: 20526369 ). 2-Hydroxybutyric acid is formed as a byproduct from the formation of alpha-ketobutyrate via a reaction catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) or alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (alphaHBDH). alpha-Hydroxybutyric acid is primarily produced in mammalian hepatic tissues that catabolize L-threonine or synthesize glutathione. Oxidative stress or detoxification of xenobiotics in the liver can dramatically increase the rate of hepatic glutathione synthesis. Under such metabolic stress conditions, supplies of L-cysteine for glutathione synthesis become limiting, so homocysteine is diverted from the transmethylation pathway (which forms methionine) into the transsulfuration pathway (which forms cystathionine). alpha-Ketobutyrate is released as a byproduct when cystathionine is cleaved into cysteine that is incorporated into glutathione. Chronic shifts in the rate of glutathione synthesis may be reflected by urinary excretion of 2-hydroxybutyrate. 2-Hydroxybutyrate is an early marker for both insulin resistance and impaired glucose regulation that appears to arise due to increased lipid oxidation and oxidative stress (PMID: 20526369 ). 2-Hydroxybutyric acid is often found in the urine of patients suffering from lactic acidosis and ketoacidosis. 2-Hydroxybutyric acid generally appears at high concentrations in situations related to deficient energy metabolism (e.g. birth asphyxia) and also in inherited metabolic diseases affecting the central nervous system during neonatal development, such as ""cerebral"" lactic acidosis, glutaric aciduria type II, dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3) deficiency, and propionic acidemia. More recently it has been noted that elevated levels of alpha-hydroxybutyrate in the plasma is a good marker for early-stage type II diabetes (PMID: 19166731 ). It was concluded from studies done in the mid-1970s that an increased NADH2/NAD ratio was the most important factor for the production of 2-hydroxybutyric acid (PMID: 168632 ).",HMDB0000008,CCC(O)C(O)=O,C4H8O3,"1S/C4H8O3/c1-2-3(5)4(6)7/h3,5H,2H2,1H3,(H,6,7)",AFENDNXGAFYKQO-UHFFFAOYSA-N,(2S)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid,0.050692876999999914,14.293154365104638,104.1045,104.047344122,4.84e+02 g/l,-0.16,0.67,3,2,2,57.53,23.3638,9.984831454501116,(S)-2-hydroxybutyric acid,0,-1,-3.7935876935907205,3.989998858113875,1,0,1,0,0,0,MDB00000004,"5338,5440,5497"

4,(R)-3-Hydroxybutyric acid,"(R)-3-Hydroxybutyric acid is a butyric acid substituted with a hydroxyl group in the beta or 3 position. It is involved in the synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies. Like the other ketone bodies (acetoacetate and acetone), levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate are raised in the blood and urine in ketosis. Beta-hydroxybutyrate is a typical partial-degradation product of branched-chain amino acids (primarily valine) released from muscle for hepatic and renal gluconeogenesis This acid is metabolized by 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (catalyzes the oxidation of D-3-hydroxybutyrate to form acetoacetate, using NAD+ as an electron acceptor). The enzyme functions in nervous tissues and muscles, enabling the use of circulating hydroxybutyrate as a fuel. In the liver mitochondrial matrix, the enzyme can also catalyze the reverse reaction, a step in ketogenesis. 3-Hydroxybutyric acid is a chiral compound having two enantiomers, D-3-hydroxybutyric acid and L-3-hydroxybutyric acid. In humans, beta-hydroxybutyrate is synthesized in the liver from acetyl-CoA, and can be used as an energy source by the brain when blood glucose is low. It can also be used for the synthesis of biodegradable plastics (Wikipedia).↵",HMDB0000011,C[C@@H](O)CC(O)=O,C4H8O3,"1S/C4H8O3/c1-3(5)2-4(6)7/h3,5H,2H2,1H3,(H,6,7)/t3-/m1/s1",WHBMMWSBFZVSSR-GSVOUGTGSA-N,(3R)-3-hydroxybutanoic acid,-0.38700599933333335,15.695695082377142,104.1045,104.047344122,5.39e+02 g/l,-0.50,0.71,3,2,2,57.53,23.464100000000002,9.959788970081753,(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid,0,-1,-2.6205133689113183,4.406291419798768,1,0,1,0,0,0,MDB00000006,"5173,5179,5183,5199,5200,5212,5237,5269,5305,5313,5321,5338,5360,5361,5421,5438,5440,5441,5446,5452,5465,5546"
5,Deoxyuridine,"2'-Deoxyuridine is a naturally occurring nucleoside. It is similar in chemical structure to uridine, but without the 2'-hydroxyl group. It is considered to be an antimetabolite that is converted to deoxyuridine triphosphate during DNA synthesis. Laboratory suppression of deoxyuridine is used to diagnose megaloblastic anemia due to vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies. Deoxyuridine exists in all living organisms and can become part of DNA in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells through two mechanisms. The first is the removal of an amino group from cytosine to result in uracil and the second is through the non-intentional incorporation of pyrimidine where thymine belongs in the DNA, resulting in deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP).",HMDB0000012,OC[C@H]1O[C@H](C[C@@H]1O)N1C=CC(=O)NC1=O,C9H12N2O5,"1S/C9H12N2O5/c12-4-6-5(13)3-8(16-6)11-2-1-7(14)10-9(11)15/h1-2,5-6,8,12-13H,3-4H2,(H,10,14,15)/t5-,6+,8+/m0/s1",MXHRCPNRJAMMIM-SHYZEUOFSA-N,"1-[(2R,4S,5R)-4-hydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)oxolan-2-yl]-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrimidine-2,4-dione",-1.514604078666666,13.907903439872065,228.202,228.074621504,9.06e+01 g/l,-1.49,-0.40,5,3,2,99.1,51.05490000000001,21.061427774885466,2'-deoxyuridine,0,0,-2.9780835884997945,9.705729612726527,1,2,1,0,0,0,MDB00000007,"5313,5548"
6,Cortexolone,"Cortexolone, also known as cortodoxone or 11-deoxycortisol, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 21-hydroxysteroids. These are steroids carrying a hydroxyl group at the 21-position of the steroid backbone. Thus, cortexolone is considered to be a steroid molecule. Cortexolone is an endogenous glucocorticoid steroid hormone, and a metabolic intermediate in the synthesis of cortisol. It was first described by Tadeusz Reichstein in 1938 and named as Substance S. It has also been referred to as Reichstein's Substance S or Compound S. Cortexolone acts as a glucocorticoid, though it is less potent than cortisol. Cortexolone is synthesized from 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone by 21-hydroxylase and is converted to cortisol by 11beta-hydroxylase. As a result, the level of cortexolone is often measured in patients to diagnose impaired cortisol synthesis, to identify any enzyme deficiency that may be causing impairment along the pathway to cortisol, and to differentiate adrenal disorders. Cortexolone in mammals has limited biological activity and mainly acts as metabolic intermediate within the glucocorticoid pathway, leading to cortisol. On the other hand, in sea lampreys, cortexolone is the major glucocorticoid, with mineralocorticoid activity. Cortexolone in sea lampreys binds to specific corticosteroid receptors and is involved in intestinal osmoregulation and in sea lamprey at metamorphosis, a process in which they develop seawater tolerance before downstream migration. Accumulation of Cortexolone in humans can happen in a defect known as congenital adrenal hyperplasia, which is due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency, resulting in androgen excess, virilization, and hypertension (PMID: 2022736 ). Cortexolone has been associated with 11-beta-Hydroxylase deficiency in young humans where in 11-beta-Hydroxylase deficiency, shows an increased concentration of 1.8 uM compared to a 0.06 uM in normal condition infants.",HMDB0000015,[H]C12CC[C@](O)(C(=O)CO)[C@@]1(C)CCC1([H])[C@@]2([H])CCC2=CC(=O)CC[C@]12C,C21H30O4,"1S/C21H30O4/c1-19-8-5-14(23)11-13(19)3-4-15-16(19)6-9-20(2)17(15)7-10-21(20,25)18(24)12-22/h11,15-17,22,25H,3-10,12H2,1-2H3/t15-,16?,17?,19+,20+,21+/m1/s1",WHBHBVVOGNECLV-HMGFGKNBSA-N,"(1S,2R,10R,11S,14R,15S)-14-hydroxy-14-(2-hydroxyacetyl)-2,15-dimethyltetracyclo[8.7.0.0^{2,7}.0^{11,15}]heptadec-6-en-5-one",2.5839312316666665,13.905648730473413,346.4605,346.214409448,2.50e-02 g/l,2.79,-4.14,4,2,2,74.6,95.80749999999995,38.86084842151295,"(1S,2R,10R,11S,14R,15S)-14-hydroxy-14-(2-hydroxyacetyl)-2,15-dimethyltetracyclo[8.7.0.0^{2,7}.0^{11,15}]heptadec-6-en-5-one",0,0,-3.329982616090181,12.591037618857374,1,4,1,1,0,0,MDB00000009,"5355,5356"

Deoxycorticosterone is not a major secretory hormone. It is produced from progesterone by 21beta-hydroxylase and is converted to corticosterone by 11beta-hydroxylase. Corticosterone is then converted to aldosterone by aldosterone synthase. Deoxycorticosterone stimulates the collecting tubules in the kidney to continue to excrete potassium in much the same way that aldosterone does. Deoxycorticosterone has about 1/20 of the sodium retaining power of aldosterone and about 1/5 the potassium excreting power of aldosterone [Wikipedia]. Deoxycorticosterone can be used to treat adrenal insufficiency. In particular, desoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) is used as replacement therapy in Addison's disease.↵",HMDB0000016,[H][C@@]12CC[C@H](C(=O)CO)[C@@]1(C)CC[C@@]1([H])[C@@]2([H])CCC2=CC(=O)CC[C@]12C,C21H30O3,"1S/C21H30O3/c1-20-9-7-14(23)11-13(20)3-4-15-16-5-6-18(19(24)12-22)21(16,2)10-8-17(15)20/h11,15-18,22H,3-10,12H2,1-2H3/t15-,16-,17-,18+,20-,21-/m0/s1",ZESRJSPZRDMNHY-YFWFAHHUSA-N,"(1S,2R,10S,11S,14S,15S)-14-(2-hydroxyacetyl)-2,15-dimethyltetracyclo[8.7.0.0^{2,7}.0^{11,15}]heptadec-6-en-5-one",3.3313563546666676,19.087225406758208,330.4611,330.219494826,1.67e-02 g/l,3.10,-4.30,3,1,2,54.37,94.40749999999997,38.18996451471434,"(1S,2R,10S,11S,14S,15S)-14-(2-hydroxyacetyl)-2,15-dimethyltetracyclo[8.7.0.0^{2,7}.0^{11,15}]heptadec-6-en-5-one",0,0,-3.295317874239208,13.864723909946662,1,4,1,1,0,0,MDB00000010,5405
8,Alpha-ketoisovaleric acid,"alpha-Ketoisovaleric acid is an abnormal organic acid that arises from the incomplete breakdown of branched-chain amino acids. alpha-Ketoisovaleric acid is a neurotoxin, an acidogen, and a metabotoxin. A neurotoxin causes damage to nerve cells and nerve tissues. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of alpha-ketoisovaleric acid are associated with maple syrup urine disease. MSUD is a metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency of the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC), leading to a buildup of the branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) and their toxic by-products (ketoacids) in the blood and urine. The symptoms of MSUD often show in infancy and lead to severe brain damage if untreated. MSUD may also present later depending on the severity of the disease. If left untreated in older individuals, during times of metabolic crisis, symptoms of the condition include uncharacteristically inappropriate, extreme, or erratic behaviour and moods, hallucinations, anorexia, weight loss, anemia, diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, lethargy, oscillating hypertonia and hypotonia, ataxia, seizures, hypoglycemia, ketoacidosis, opisthotonus, pancreatitis, rapid neurological decline, and coma. In maple syrup urine disease, the brain concentration of branched-chain ketoacids can increase 10- to 20-fold. This leads to a depletion of glutamate and a consequent reduction in the concentration of brain glutamine, aspartate, alanine, and other amino acids. The result is a compromise of energy metabolism because of a failure of the malate-aspartate shuttle and a diminished rate of protein synthesis (PMID: 15930465 ). alpha-Ketoisovaleric acid is a keto-acid, which is a subclass of organic acids. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart, liver, and kidney abnormalities, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of untreated MSUD.

12,3-O-Sulfogalactosylceramide (d18:1/24:0),"3-O-Sulfogalactosylceramide is an acidic, sulfated glycosphingolipid, often known as sulfatide. This lipid occurs in membranes of various cell types, but is found in particularly high concentrations in myelin where it constitutes 3-4% of total membrane lipids. This lipid is synthesized primarily in the oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system. Accumulation of this lipid in the lysosomes is a characteristic of metachromatic leukodystrophy, a lysosomal storage disease caused by the deficiency of arylsulfatase A. Alterations in sulfatide metabolism, trafficking, and homeostasis are present in the earliest clinically recognizable stages of Alzheimer's disease. Cerebrosides are glycosphingolipids. There are four types of glycosphingolipids, the cerebrosides, sulfatides, globosides and gangliosides. Cerebrosides have a single sugar group linked to ceramide. The most common are galactocerebrosides (containing galactose), the least common are glucocerebrosides (containing glucose). Galactocerebrosides are found predominantly in neuronal cell membranes. In contrast glucocerebrosides are not normally found in membranes. Instead, they are typically intermediates in the synthesis or degradation of more complex glycosphingolipids. Galactocerebrosides are synthesized from ceramide and UDP-galactose. Excess lysosomal accumulation of glucocerebrosides is found in Gaucher disease. - Sulfatides are glycosphingolipids. There are four types of glycosphingolipids, the cerebrosides, sulfatides, globosides and gangliosides. Sulfatides are the sulfuric acid esters of galactocerebrosides.

14,Biotin,"Biotin is a heterocyclic, S-containing monocarboxylic acid consisting of two fused rings (a ureido and a tetrahydrothiophene ring). Biotin is an enzyme co-factor present in minute amounts in every living cell. It is also known as vitamin H or B7 or coenzyme R. It occurs mainly bound to proteins or polypeptides and is abundant in liver, kidney, pancreas, yeast, and milk. Biotin has been recognized as an essential nutrient. The normal human biotin requirement is fulfilled in part through diet, through endogenous reutilization of biotin and perhaps through capture of biotin generated in the intestinal flora. The utilization of biotin for covalent attachment to carboxylases and its reutilization through the release of carboxylase biotin after proteolytic degradation constitutes the 'biotin cycle'. Biotin deficiency is associated with neurological manifestations, skin rash, hair loss and metabolic disturbances that are thought to relate to the various carboxylase deficiencies (metabolic ketoacidosis with lactic acidosis). It has also been suggested that biotin deficiency is associated with protein malnutrition, and that marginal biotin deficiency in pregnant women may be teratogenic. Biotin acts as a carboxyl carrier in carboxylation reactions. There are four biotin-dependent carboxylases in mammals: those of propionyl-CoA (PCC), 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA (MCC), pyruvate (PC) and acetyl-CoA carboxylases (isoforms ACC-1 and ACC-2). All but ACC-2 are mitochondrial enzymes. The biotin moiety is covalently bound to the epsilon amino group of a Lysine residue in each of these carboxylases in a domain 60-80 amino acids long. The domain is structurally similar among carboxylases from bacteria to mammals. There are four biotin-dependent carboxylases in mammals: those of propionyl-CoA (PCC), 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA (MCC), pyruvate (PC) and acetyl-CoA carboxylases (isoforms ACC-1 and ACC-2). All but ACC-2 are mitochondrial enzymes. The biotin moiety is covalently bound to the epsilon amino group of a Lys residue in each of these carboxylases in a domain 60-80 amino acids long. The domain is structurally similar among carboxylases from bacteria to mammals. Evidence is emerging that biotin participates in processes other than classical carboxylation reactions. Specifically, novel roles for biotin in cell signaling, gene expression, and chromatin structure have been identified in recent years. Human cells accumulate biotin by using both the sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter and monocarboxylate transporter 1. These transporters and other biotin-binding proteins partition biotin to compartments involved in biotin signaling: cytoplasm, mitochondria, and nuclei. The activity of cell signals such as biotinyl-AMP, Sp1 and Sp3, nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, and receptor tyrosine kinases depends on biotin supply. Consistent with a role for biotin and its catabolites in modulating these cell signals, greater than 2000 biotin-dependent genes have been identified in various human tissues. Many biotin-dependent gene products play roles in signal transduction and localize to the cell nucleus, consistent with a role for biotin in cell signaling. Posttranscriptional events related to ribosomal activity and protein folding may further contribute to effects of biotin on gene expression. Finally, research has shown that biotinidase and holocarboxylase synthetase mediate covalent binding of biotin to histones (DNA-binding proteins), affecting chromatin structure; at least seven biotinylation sites have been identified in human histones. Biotinylation of histones appears to play a role in cell proliferation, gene silencing, and the cellular response to DNA repair. Roles for biotin in cell signaling and chromatin structure are consistent with the notion that biotin has a unique significance in cell biology.

15,Carnosine,"Carnosine, which is also known as beta-alanyl-L-histidine, is a dipeptide consisting of the amino acids beta-alanine and histidine. It is found exclusively in animal tissues and brain tissues and is naturally produced in the body by the liver. Carnosine has a pKa value of 6.83, making it a good buffer for the pH range of animal muscles. Since beta-alanine is a non-proteogenic amino acid and is not incorporated into proteins, carnosine can be stored at relatively high concentrations (millimolar) in muscles, with concentrations as high as 17-25 mmol/kg (dry muscle). Carnosine is also highly concentrated in brain tissues. Carnosine has been shown to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as alpha-beta unsaturated aldehydes formed from peroxidation of fatty acids during oxidative stress. The antioxidant mechanism of carnosine is attributed to its chelating effect against divalent metal ions, superoxide dismutase (SOD)-like activity, as well as its ROS and free radicals scavenging ability (PMID: 16406688). Carnosine also buffers muscle cells, and acts as a neurotransmitter in the brain. Carnosine has the potential to suppress many of the biochemical changes that accompany ageing (e.g. protein oxidation, glycation, AGE formation, and cross-linking) and associated pathologies (PMID: 16804013). Some autistic patients take carnosine as a dietary supplement and attribute an improvement in their condition to it. Supplemental carnosine may increase corticosterone levels. This may explain the ""hyperactivity"" seen in autistic subjects at higher doses. A positive association between muscle tissue carnosine concentration and exercise performance has been found. beta-Alanine supplementation is thought to increase exercise performance by promoting carnosine production in muscle. Exercise has conversely been found to increase muscle carnosine concentrations, and muscle carnosine content is higher in athletes engaging in anaerobic exercise. Carnosine is also a biomarker for the consumption of meat. Elevated levels of urinary and plasma carnosine are associated with carnosinuria (also known as carnosinemia), which is an inborn error of metabolism caused by a deficiency of the enzyme carnosinase (PMID: 2674258). Carnosinas cleaves carnosine into its constituent amino acids: beta-Alanine and histidine. Carnosinemia results in an excess of carnosine in the urine, cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and nervous tissue. A variety of neurological symptoms have been associated with carnosinemia. They include: hypotonia, developmental delay, mental retardation, degeneration of axons, sensory neuropathy, tremors, demyelination, gray matter anomalies, myoclonic seizures, and loss of purkinje fibres. Additionally, carnosine is identified as a biomarker for Alzheimer’s disease and its levels are significantly lower in probable Alzheimer’s Disease subjects (0.33 +/- 0.09 μM) than in control subjects’ plasma (0.65 +/- 0.1 μM) (PMID : 17031479).",HMDB0000033,NCCC(=O)N[C@@H](CC1=CN=CN1)C(O)=O,C9H14N4O3,"1S/C9H14N4O3/c10-2-1-8(14)13-7(9(15)16)3-6-4-11-5-12-6/h4-5,7H,1-3,10H2,(H,11,12)(H,13,14)(H,15,16)/t7-/m0/s1",CQOVPNPJLQNMDC-ZETCQYMHSA-N,(2S)-2-(3-aminopropanamido)-3-(1H-imidazol-5-yl)propanoic acid,-4.480241342175954,12.867210570530204,226.2325,226.106590334,1.11e+01 g/l,-2.96,-1.31,5,4,6,121.1,55.56190000000001,22.36612322974625,β-alanyl-L-histidine,0,1,9.12598191586239,3.371243802200665,1,1,1,0,0,0,MDB00000023,"5184,5313"
16,Adenine,"Adenine is a purine base. Adenine is found in both DNA and RNA and is a fundamental component of adenine nucleotides. Adenine forms adenosine, a nucleoside, when attached to ribose, and deoxyadenosine when attached to deoxyribose; it forms adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a nucleotide, when three phosphate groups are added to adenosine. Adenosine triphosphate is used in cellular metabolism as one of the basic methods of transferring chemical energy between chemical reactions. Adenine is derived from the nucleotide known is inosine monophosphate (IMP), which is synthesized from ribose phosphate. The pathway is called the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway. Adenine is degraded into uric acid. Historically, adenine was sometimes called Vitamin B4.  However, due to the fact that it can be synthesized by the body and is not required by diet, it does not meet the definition of vitamin and so adenine is no longer part of the Vitamin B complex. Purines, such as adenine and guanine are found in high concentration in meat and meat products, especially internal organs such as liver and kidney. A moderate amount of adenine is also contained in red meat, beef, pork, poultry, fish and seafood, asparagus, cauliflower, spinach, mushrooms, green peas, lentils, dried peas, beans, oatmeal, wheat bran, and wheat germ. Deficits in adenine production, transport and metabolism can have serious health consequences. Purine inborn errors of metabolism (IEM), such as Adenine phosphoribosyltransferase. Deficiency, Adenylosuccinate synthase deficiency, AICAR-transformylase/IMP-cyclohydrolase deficiency and Lesch-Nyhan disease are serious hereditary disorders.

19,Butyric acid,"Butyric acid, a four-carbon fatty acid, is formed in the human colon by bacterial fermentation of carbohydrates (including dietary fiber), and putatively suppresses colorectal cancer (CRC). Butyrate has diverse and apparently paradoxical effects on cellular proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation that may be either pro-neoplastic or anti-neoplastic, depending upon factors such as the level of exposure, availability of other metabolic substrates and the intracellular milieu. In humans, the relationship between luminal butyrate exposure and CRC has been examined only indirectly in case-control studies, by measuring fecal butyrate concentrations, although this may not accurately reflect effective butyrate exposure during carcinogenesis. Perhaps not surprisingly, results of these investigations have been mutually contradictory. The direct effect of butyrate on tumorigenesis has been assessed in a no. of in vivo animal models, which have also yielded conflicting results. In part, this may be explained by methodology: differences in the amount and route of butyrate administration, which are likely to significantly influence delivery of butyrate to the distal colon (PMID: 16460475). Butyric acid is a carboxylic acid found in rancid butter, parmesan cheese, and vomit, and has an unpleasant odor and acrid taste, with a sweetish aftertaste (similar to ether). Butyric acid is a fatty acid occurring in the form of esters in animal fats and plant oils. Interestingly, low-molecular-weight esters of butyric acid, such as methyl butyrate, have mostly pleasant aromas or tastes. As a consequence, they find use as food and perfume additives.

20,Acetic acid,"Acetic acid is one of the simplest carboxylic acids. It exists as a clear liquid with a sour taste and pungent odor. Acetic acid is produced naturally, in small amounts, in living organisms through oxidative and anaerobic fermentation of sugars and carbohydrates. Acetate is also derived from the hydrolysis of acetyl-CoA during periods of fasting and through the breakdown of ketone bodies such as acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate. Acetic acid is also produced industrially in large volumes through the carbonylation of methanol, and is an important chemical reagent and industrial chemical that is used in the production of plastic soft drink bottles, photographic film; and polyvinyl acetate for wood glue, as well as many synthetic fibres and fabrics. In households diluted acetic acid is often used as a cleaning agent. In the food industry acetic acid is used as an acidity regulator. Acetic acid plays a key role in biochemistry and is vital to many biochemical reactions related to carbohydrate, amino acid and fat metabolism as well as energy production. Acetic acid contributes to the acetyl group, which is fundamental to the biochemistry of virtually all forms of life. When bound to coenzyme A, to form acetyl-CoA, it is central to the metabolism of carbohydrates and fats. However, the concentration of free acetic acid in cells is kept at a low level to avoid disrupting the control of the pH of the cell contents. Acetic acid is produced and excreted by certain bacteria, notably the Acetobacter genus and Clostridium acetobutylicum. These bacteria are found universally in foodstuffs, water, and soil, and acetic acid is produced naturally as fruits and some other foods spoil. Acetic acid is also a component of the vaginal lubrication of humans and other primates, where it appears to serve as a mild antibacterial agent.",HMDB0000042,CC(O)=O,C2H4O2,"1S/C2H4O2/c1-2(3)4/h1H3,(H,3,4)",QTBSBXVTEAMEQO-UHFFFAOYSA-N,acetic acid,-0.2233457143333334,,60.052,60.021129372,3.23e+02 g/l,-0.12,0.73,2,1,0,37.3,12.643699999999999,5.338057886014139,acetic acid,0,-1,,4.543439679000835,1,0,1,0,1,0,MDB00000029,"5206,5223,5291,5338,5399,5440,5441"
21,Betaine,"Betaine or trimethylglycine is a methylated derivative of glycine. It functions as a methyl donor in that it carries and donates methyl functional groups to facilitate necessary chemical processes. The donation of methyl groups is important to proper liver function, cellular replication, and detoxification reactions. Betaine also plays a role in the manufacture of carnitine and serves to protect the kidneys from damage. Betaine has also been of interest for its role in osmoregulation. As a drug, betaine hydrochloride has been used as a source of hydrochloric acid in the treatment of hypochlorhydria. Betaine has also been used in the treatment of liver disorders, for hyperkalemia, for homocystinuria, and for gastrointestinal disturbances (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th Ed, p1341).↵",HMDB0000043,C[N+](C)(C)CC([O-])=O,C5H11NO2,"1S/C5H11NO2/c1-6(2,3)4-5(7)8/h4H2,1-3H3",KWIUHFFTVRNATP-UHFFFAOYSA-N,(carboxymethyl)trimethylazanium,-4.494183842471745,,117.1463,117.078978601,1.75e+00 g/l,-2.12,-1.94,2,1,2,37.3,41.9863,12.522298635930067,trimethyl glycine,1,0,,2.2595637800263866,1,0,1,0,1,0,MDB00000030,"5172,5177,5206,5223,5302,5304,5305,5338,5440,5441,5499,5500"
22,Ascorbic acid,"Ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) is an essential nutrient in the human diet, and is necessary to maintain connective tissue and bone. The biologically active form of ascorbic acid is vitamin C. Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin. Primates (including humans) and a few other species in all divisions of the animal kingdom, notably the guinea pig, have lost the ability to synthesize ascorbic acid and must obtain it in their food. Ascorbic acid is an electron donor for enzymes involved in collagen hydroxylation, biosynthesis of carnitine and norepinephrine, tyrosine metabolism, and amidation of peptide hormones. Ascrobic acid (vitamin C) deficiency causes scurvy. The amount of vitamin C necessary to prevent scurvy may not be adequate to maintain optimal health. The ability of vitamin C to donate electrons also makes it a potent water-soluble antioxidant that readily scavenges free radicals such as molecular oxygen, superoxide, hydroxyl radical, and hypochlorous acid. In this setting, several mechanisms could account for a link between vitamin C and heart disease. One is the relation between LDL oxidation and vitamins C and E. Vitamin C in vitro can recycle vitamin E, which can donate electrons to prevent LDL oxidation in vitro. As the lipid-phase vitamin E is oxidized, it can be regenerated by aqueous vitamin C. Other possibilities are that vitamin C could decrease cholesterol by mechanisms not well characterized, or could improve vasodilatation and vascular reactivity, perhaps by decreasing the interactions of nitric oxide with oxidants (PMID: 10799361).↵",HMDB0000044,[H][C@@]1(OC(=O)C(O)=C1O)[C@@H](O)CO,C6H8O6,"1S/C6H8O6/c7-1-2(8)5-3(9)4(10)6(11)12-5/h2,5,7-10H,1H2/t2-,5+/m0/s1",CIWBSHSKHKDKBQ-JLAZNSOCSA-N,"(5R)-5-[(1S)-1,2-dihydroxyethyl]-3,4-dihydroxy-2,5-dihydrofuran-2-one",-1.9135588756666668,11.181873536050066,176.1241,176.032087988,2.45e+02 g/l,-1.58,0.14,5,4,2,107.22,37.0321,14.932525092170716,vitamin C,0,-1,-2.979728932431362,4.359916949362066,1,1,1,0,0,0,MDB00000031,"5175,5179,5352"
23,Adenosine,"Adenosine is a nucleoside that is composed of adenine and D-ribose attached via a beta-N9-glycosidic bond. Adenosine or adenosine derivatives play many important biological roles in addition to being components of DNA and RNA. Adenosine is essential to all life. Adenosine is one of the four nucleoside bases used to assemble RNA, while deoxyadenosine (a derivative of adenosine) is used to assemble DNA. Additionally, adenosine plays an important role in energy transfer - as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). It also plays a role in signal transduction as cyclic adenosine monophosphate, cAMP. Adenosine itself is both a neurotransmitter and potent vasodilator. Cellular signaling by adenosine occurs through four known adenosine receptor subtypes (A1, A2A, A2B, and A3). The four receptor subtypes are further classified based on their ability to either stimulate or inhibit adenylate cyclase activity. When administered intravenously, adenosine causes transient heart block in the AV node. This is mediated via the A1 receptor, inhibiting adenylyl cyclase, reducing cAMP and so causing cell hyperpolarization by increasing K+ efflux via inward rectifier K+ channels, subsequently inhibiting Ca2+ current. Because of the effects of adenosine on AV node-dependent supraventricular tachycardia, adenosine is considered a class V antiarrhythmic agent. Adenosine exhibits anti-inflammatory activity through its action via the A2A receptor. Topical treatment of adenosine to foot wounds in diabetes mellitus has been shown in lab animals to drastically increase tissue repair and reconstruction. It also plays a role in regulation of blood flow to various organs through vasodilation.",HMDB0000050,NC1=C2N=CN([C@@H]3O[C@H](CO)[C@@H](O)[C@H]3O)C2=NC=N1,C10H13N5O4,"1S/C10H13N5O4/c11-8-5-9(13-2-12-8)15(3-14-5)10-7(18)6(17)4(1-16)19-10/h2-4,6-7,10,16-18H,1H2,(H2,11,12,13)/t4-,6-,7-,10-/m1/s1",OIRDTQYFTABQOQ-KQYNXXCUSA-N,"(2R,3R,4S,5R)-2-(6-amino-9H-purin-9-yl)-5-(hydroxymethyl)oxolane-3,4-diol",-2.0909638716666668,13.891216626641981,267.2413,267.096753929,1.40e+01 g/l,-1.21,-1.28,8,4,2,139.54,63.1956,25.28306076008305,adenosine,0,0,3.921276940416587,12.45400327595609,1,3,1,0,0,0,MDB00000034,"5240,5313,5364,5462"
24,Ammonia,"Ammonia is a colorless alkaline gas with a characteristic sharp smell. Ammonia is one of the most abundant nitrogen-containing compounds in the atmosphere. It is an irritant with a characteristic pungent odor, which is widely used in industry. Inasmuch as ammonia is highly soluble in water and, upon inhalation, is deposited in the upper airways, occupational exposures to ammonia have commonly been associated with sinusitis, upper airway irritation, and eye irritation. Acute exposures to high levels of ammonia have also been associated with diseases of the lower airways and interstitial lung. Ammonia has been shown to be a neurotoxin that predominantly affects astrocytes. Disturbed mitochondrial function and oxidative stress, factors implicated in the induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition, appear to be involved in the mechanism of ammonia neurotoxicity. Ammonia is formed in nearly all tissues and organs of the vertebrate organism; it is the most common endogenous neurotoxic compounds. Ammonia can affect the glutamatergic and GABAergic neuronal systems, the two prevailing neuronal systems of the cortical structures. Ammonia is well recognized to be central in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy and has been of importance to generations dating back to the early Egyptians. The gut produces ammonia which is metabolized in the liver and almost all organ systems are involved in ammonia metabolism. Colonic bacteria produce ammonia by splitting urea and other amino acids, however this does not explain hyperammonemia and hepatic encephalopathy. The alternative explanation is that hyperammonemia is the result of intestinal breakdown of amino acids, especially glutamine. The intestines have significant glutaminase activity, predominantly located in the enterocytes. On the other hand, this organ has only a little glutamine synthetase activity, making it a major glutamine-consuming organ. In addition to the intestine, the kidney is an important source of blood ammonia in patients with liver disease. Ammonia is also taken up by the muscle and brain in hepatic coma, and there is confirmation that ammonia is metabolized in muscle. The excessive formation of ammonia in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients has been demonstrated, and it has been shown that some Alzheimer's disease patients exhibit elevated blood ammonia concentrations. Ammonia is the most important natural modulator of lysosomal protein processing: there is evidence for the involvement of aberrant lysosomal processing of beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta-APP) in the formation of amyloid deposits. Inflammatory processes and activation of microglia are widely believed to be implicated in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. Ammonia is able to affect the characteristic functions of microglia, such as endocytosis, and cytokine production. Based on these facts, an ammonia-based hypothesis for Alzheimer's disease has been suggested (PMID: 17006913, 16167195, 15377862, 15369278, 12020619).↵",HMDB0000051,N,H3N,1S/H3N/h1H3,QGZKDVFQNNGYKY-UHFFFAOYSA-N,ammonia,-0.9779999999999999,,17.0305,17.026549101,,,,1,1,0,13.59,15.5149,1.9904529105652708,ammonia,0,1,8.861981369487705,,1,0,1,0,1,0,MDB00000035,"5224,5261,5286,5322,5360,5409,5413,5421,5427,5438,5455,5480,5489,5505,5524,5527,5529,5530,5536,5555"
25,Argininosuccinic acid,"Arginosuccinic acid is a basic, non-proteinogenic amino acid formed via the covalent linkage of arginine and succinic acid. Some cells synthesize it from citrulline, aspartic acid and use it as a precursor for arginine in the urea cycle or Citrulline-NO cycle. The enzyme that catalyzes the reaction is argininosuccinate synthetase. Argininosuccinic acid is a precursor to fumarate in the citric acid cycle via argininosuccinate lyase. Defects in the arginosuccinate lyase enzyme can lead to arginosuccinate lyase deficiency. Argininosuccinate (ASA) lyase deficiency results in defective cleavage of ASA. This leads to an accumulation of ASA in cells and an excessive excretion of ASA in urine (arginosuccinic aciduria). In virtually all respects, this disorder shares the characteristics of other urea cycle defects. The most important characteristic of ASA lyase deficiency is its propensity to cause hyperammonemia in affected individuals. ASA in affected individuals is excreted by the kidney at a rate practically equivalent to the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Whether ASA itself causes a degree of toxicity due to hepatocellular accumulation is unknown; such an effect could help explain hyperammonemia development in affected individuals. Regardless, the name of the disease is derived from the rapid clearance of ASA in urine, although elevated levels of ASA can be found in plasma. ASA lyase deficiency is associated with high mortality and morbidity rates. Symptoms of ASA lyase deficiency include anorexia, irritability rapid breathing, lethargy and vomiting. Extreme symptoms include coma and cerebral edema.↵",HMDB0000052,N[C@@H](CCCNC(=N)N[C@@H](CC(O)=O)C(O)=O)C(O)=O,C10H18N4O6,"1S/C10H18N4O6/c11-5(8(17)18)2-1-3-13-10(12)14-6(9(19)20)4-7(15)16/h5-6H,1-4,11H2,(H,15,16)(H,17,18)(H,19,20)(H3,12,13,14)/t5-,6-/m0/s1",KDZOASGQNOPSCU-WDSKDSINSA-N,(2S)-2-{N'-[(4S)-4-amino-4-carboxybutyl]carbamimidamido}butanedioic acid,-5.803854917241661,3.2332188556928654,290.2731,290.122634328,4.56e-01 g/l,-3.25,-2.80,10,7,9,185.82999999999998,75.3116,27.598868203245992,argininosuccinic acid,0,-1,12.386778734858158,2.1362975685976218,1,0,0,0,0,0,MDB00000036,"5223,5224,5315"
26,Androstenedione,"Androstenedione is a delta-4 19-carbon steroid that is produced not only in the testis, but also in the ovary and the adrenal cortex. Depending on the tissue type, androstenedione can serve as a precursor to testosterone as well as estrone and estradiol. It is the common precursor of male and female sex hormones and can be purchased as an oral supplement to increase testosterone levels (PMID: 34684800). Simply known as ""andro"" by athletes, it boosts testosterone levels and is believed to enhance athletic performance, build body muscles, reduce fats, increase energy, maintain healthy RBCs, and increase sexual performance. Androstenedione belongs to the class of organic compounds known as androgens and derivatives. These are 3-hydroxylated C19 steroid hormones. They are known to favour the development of masculine characteristics. They also show profound effects on scalp and body hair in humans. Some androstenedione is also secreted into the plasma and may be converted in peripheral tissues to testosterone and estrogens. Androstenedione originates either from the conversion of dehydroepiandrosterone or from 17-hydroxyprogesterone. It is further converted to either testosterone or estrone. The production of adrenal androstenedione is governed by the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), while the production of gonadal androstenedione is under control by gonadotropins. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a triad of anovulation, insulin resistance, and hyperandrogenism. Diagnostic criteria for PCOS have changed significantly in recent years but measuring androgen excess remains the primary clinical feature that defines the condition and may contribute in part to its adverse metabolic phenotype (PMID : 24423344). In specific, androstenedione is significantly elevated in the serum of PCOS women (0.014 ± 0.010 μM) (p = 0.02) compared to normal individuals (0.008 ± 0.0083 μM) (p = 0.02) (PMID: 32508549). Elevated levels of androstenedione is also found in Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) - the most common autosomal recessive inherited endocrine disease where the steroid 11β-hydroxylase deficiency (11β-OHD) is the second most common form of CAH. Biochemical abnormalities in children (1-13 years old) with 11β-OHD have shown to be consistent with elevated levels of androstenedione in serum (0.00360-0.0227 μM) compared to normal children (1-13 years old) (<0.00100 μM) (PMID: 8933406).",HMDB0000053,[H][C@@]12CCC(=O)[C@@]1(C)CC[C@@]1([H])[C@@]2([H])CCC2=CC(=O)CC[C@]12C,C19H26O2,"1S/C19H26O2/c1-18-9-7-13(20)11-12(18)3-4-14-15-5-6-17(21)19(15,2)10-8-16(14)18/h11,14-16H,3-10H2,1-2H3/t14-,15-,16-,18-,19-/m0/s1",AEMFNILZOJDQLW-QAGGRKNESA-N,"(1S,2R,10R,11S,15S)-2,15-dimethyltetracyclo[8.7.0.0^{2,7}.0^{11,15}]heptadec-6-ene-5,14-dione",3.9289510033333337,,286.4085,286.193280076,2.70e-02 g/l,2.93,-4.03,2,0,0,34.14,83.60749999999999,33.2052257389703,"(1S,2R,10R,11S,15S)-2,15-dimethyltetracyclo[8.7.0.0^{2,7}.0^{11,15}]heptadec-6-ene-5,14-dione",0,0,-4.816491550715536,19.028996560003517,1,4,1,1,1,0,MDB00000037,"5193,5194,5231,5314,5355,5356,5357,5403,5465,5466"

29,Cyclic AMP,"Cyclic AMP (cAMP) or cyclic adenosine monophosphate is an adenine nucleotide containing one phosphate group which is esterified to both the 3'- and 5'-positions of the sugar moiety. cAMP is found in all organisms ranging from bacteria to plants to animals. In humans and other mammals it is a second messenger and a key intracellular regulator, functioning as a mediator of activity for a number of hormones, including epinephrine, glucagon and ACTH. cAMP is synthesized from ATP by adenylate cyclase. Adenylate cyclase is located at the inner side of cell membranes. Adenylate cyclase is activated by the hormones glucagon and adrenaline and by G protein. Liver adenylate cyclase responds more strongly to glucagon, and muscle adenylate cyclase responds more strongly to adrenaline. cAMP decomposition into AMP is catalyzed by the enzyme phosphodiesterase. cAMP is primarily used for intracellular signal transduction, such as transferring into cells the effects of hormones like glucagon and adrenaline, which cannot pass through the plasma membrane. cAMP is also involved in the activation of protein kinases. In addition, cAMP binds to and regulates the function of ion channels such as the HCN channels. Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels are integral membrane proteins that serve as nonselective voltage-gated cation channels in the plasma membranes of heart and brain cells. HCN channels are sometimes referred to as pacemaker channels because they help to generate rhythmic activity within groups of heart and brain cells.90 , 1050990). cAMP levels have been found to be significantly elevated in serous meningitis (0.0338 +/- 0.012 5 µM) compared to normal individuals (0.020 2 +/- 0.040 µM) (PMID: 6326460). cAMP has also been identified as a marker for idiopathic polyneuritis where its concentration is significantly lower in the cerebrospinal fluid of disease individuals (0.01 +/- 0.003 µM) compared to normal individuals (0.020 2 +/- 0.040 µM) (PMID: 6326460).",HMDB0000058,NC1=NC=NC2=C1N=CN2[C@@H]1O[C@@H]2COP(O)(=O)O[C@H]2[C@H]1O,C10H12N5O6P,"1S/C10H12N5O6P/c11-8-5-9(13-2-12-8)15(3-14-5)10-6(16)7-4(20-10)1-19-22(17,18)21-7/h2-4,6-7,10,16H,1H2,(H,17,18)(H2,11,12,13)/t4-,6-,7-,10-/m1/s1",IVOMOUWHDPKRLL-KQYNXXCUSA-N,"(4aR,6R,7R,7aS)-6-(6-amino-9H-purin-9-yl)-2,7-dihydroxy-hexahydro-2lambda5-furo[3,2-d][1,3,2]dioxaphosphinin-2-one",-3.3924794780069596,12.588619397066793,329.2059,329.052519653,3.58e+00 g/l,-2.29,-1.96,8,3,1,154.84,70.2895,28.42295790219419,"(4aR,6R,7R,7aS)-6-(6-aminopurin-9-yl)-2,7-dihydroxy-tetrahydro-4H-2lambda5-furo[3,2-d][1,3,2]dioxaphosphinin-2-one",0,-1,3.9248049140967343,1.8292367774944256,1,4,1,0,0,0,MDB00000040,"5179,5383"
30,Acetoacetic acid,"Acetoacetic acid (AcAc) is a weak organic acid and can be produced in the human liver under certain conditions of poor metabolism leading to excessive fatty acid breakdown (diabetes mellitus leading to diabetic ketoacidosis), it is then partially converted to acetone by decarboxylation and excreted either in urine or through respiration. Acetoacetate is a ketone body. Ketone bodies are the water-soluble molecules (acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and the spontaneous breakdown product of acetoacetate, acetone) containing the ketone group that are produced by the liver from fatty acids during periods of low food intake (fasting), carbohydrate restrictive diets, starvation, prolonged intense exercise, alcoholism, or in untreated (or inadequately treated) type 1 diabetes mellitus. Persistent mild hyperketonemia with moderately high levels of acetoacetate is a common finding in newborns. Acetoacetate and other ketone bodies serve as an indispensable source of energy for extrahepatic tissues. Another important function of ketone bodies is to provide acetoacetyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA for synthesis of cholesterol, fatty acids, and complex lipids. During the early postnatal period, acetoacetate (AcAc) and beta-hydroxybutyrate are preferred over glucose as substrates for synthesis of phospholipids and sphingolipids in accord with requirements for brain growth and myelination. Thus, during the first 2 wk of postnatal development, when the accumulation of cholesterol and phospholipids accelerates, the proportion of ketone bodies incorporated into these lipids increases. On the other hand, an increased proportion of ketone bodies are utilized for cerebroside synthesis during the period of active myelination. In the lung, AcAc serves better than glucose as a precursor for the synthesis of lung phospholipids. The synthesized lipids, particularly dipalmityl phosphatidylcholine, are incorporated into surfactant, and thus have a potential role in supplying adequate surfactant lipids to maintain lung function during the early days of life (PMID 3884391). Acetoacetate is also present in the metabolism of those undergoing starvation or prolonged physical exertion as part of gluconeogenesis. When ketone bodies are measured by way of urine concentration, acetoacetic acid, along with beta-hydroxybutyric acid or acetone, is what is detected.↵",HMDB0000060,CC(=O)CC(O)=O,C4H6O3,"1S/C4H6O3/c1-3(5)2-4(6)7/h2H2,1H3,(H,6,7)",WDJHALXBUFZDSR-UHFFFAOYSA-N,3-oxobutanoic acid,-0.0014917456666668494,15.223356862546826,102.0886,102.031694058,2.40e+02 g/l,-0.47,0.37,3,1,2,54.37,22.5389,9.179267520270244,acetoacetic acid,0,-1,-7.473176600242656,4.024917062647246,1,0,1,0,0,0,MDB00000041,"5179,5199,5200,5212,5338,5346,5360,5416,5440,5441,5446"
31,L-Carnitine,"Carnitine is is a quaternary ammonium compound involved in fatty acid metabolism. It is also classified as an amino acid, but it is not an essential amino acid; it can be synthesized in the body. Because carnitine is particuarly important in providing energy to muscles including the heart-that some researchers are now recommending carnitine supplements in the diet, particularly for people who do not consume much red meat, the main food source for carnitine. Carnitine has been described as a vitamin, an amino acid, or a metabimin, i.e., an essential metabolite. Like the B vitamins, carnitine contains nitrogen and is very soluble in water. However, unlike other B vitamins, it can be synthesized in the body. Almost all animals, including humans, make their own carnitine. As a result carnitine is no longer considered a vitamin. Nevertheless, in certain circumstances-such as deficiencies of methionine, lysine or vitamin C or kidney dialysis--carnitine shortages develop. Under these conditions, carnitine must be absorbed from food, and for this reason it is sometimes referred to as a ""metabimin"" or a conditionally essential metabolite. Like the other amino acids used or manufactured by the body, carnitine is an amine. But like choline, carnitine is also an alcohol (specifically, a trimethylated carboxy-alcohol). Thus, carnitine is an unusual amino acid and has different functions than most other amino acids, which are most usually employed by the body in the synthesis of protein. Carnitine is an essential factor in fatty acid metabolism in mammals. Its most important known metabolic function is to transport fat into the mitochondria of muscle cells, including those in the heart, for oxidation. This is how the heart gets most of its energy. In humans, about 25% of carnitine is synthesized in the liver, kidney and brain via the amino acids, lysine and methionine. Most of the carnitine in the body comes from dietary sources such as red meat and dairy products. Inborn errors of carnitine metabolism can lead to brain deterioration like that of Reye's syndrome, gradually worsening muscle weakness, Duchenne-like muscular dystrophy and extreme muscle weakness with fat accumulation in muscles. Borurn et al. (1979) describe carnitine as an essential nutrient for pre-term babies, certain types (non-ketotic) of hypoglycemics, kidney dialysis patients, cirrhosis, and in kwashiorkor, type IV hyperlipidemia, heart muscle disease (cardiomyopathy), and propionic or organic aciduria (acid urine resulting from genetic or other anomalies). In all these conditions and the inborn errors of carnitine metabolism, carnitine is essential to life and carnitine supplements are valuable. carnitine therapy may also be useful in a wide variety of clinical conditions. carnitine supplementation has improved some patients who have angina secondary to coronary artery disease. It may be worth a trial in any form of hyperlipidemia or muscle weakness. carnitine supplements may be useful in many forms of toxic or metabolic liver disease and in cases of heart muscle disease. Hearts undergoing severe arrhythmia quickly deplete their stores of carnitine. Athletes, particularly in Europe, have used carnitine supplements for improved endurance. carnitine may improve muscle building by improving fat utilization and may even be useful in treating obesity. carnitine joins a long list of nutrients which may be of value in treating pregnant women, hypothyroid individuals, and male infertility due to low motility of sperm. Even the Physician's Desk Reference gives indication for carnitine supplements as ""improving the tolerance of ischemic heart disease, myocardial insufficiencies, and type IV hyperlipoproteinemia. carnitine deficiency is noted in abnormal liver function, renal dialysis patients, and severe to moderate muscular weakness with associated anorexia.""

32,Cortisol,"Cortisol is the main glucocorticoid secreted by the adrenal cortex and it is involved in the stress response. Its synthetic counterpart hydrocortisone is used, either as an injection or topically, in the treatment of inflammation, allergy, collagen diseases, asthma, adrenocortical deficiency, shock, and some neoplastic conditions. Synthetic cortisol known as hydrocortisone is synthesized from pregnenolone and is used as an immunosuppressive drug given by injection in the treatment of severe allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis and angioedema, in place of prednisolone in patients who need steroid treatment but cannot take oral medication, and peri-operatively in patients on long-term steroid treatment to prevent an Addisonian crisis. Cortisol inhibits production of interleukin (IL)-12, interferon (IFN)-gamma, IFN-alpha, and tumor-necrosis-factor (TNF)-alpha by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and T helper (Th)1 cells, but upregulates IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13 by Th2 cells. In addition to its immunosuppressive effects, cortisol increases glomerular filtration rate, and renal plasma flow from the kidneys thus increasing phosphate excretion, as well as increasing sodium and water retention and potassium excretion. Cortisol works with adrenaline to create memories of short-term emotional events. This is the proposed mechanism for the formation and storage of “flash bulb” memories. Cortisol increases blood pressure, blood sugar levels, may cause infertility in women, and suppresses the immune system. The amount of cortisol present in the serum undergoes diurnal variation, with the highest levels present in the early morning, in response to stress and low blood-glucose concentrations. In adults (>18 years old) undergoing a period of stress, cortisol is found to be significantly increased in the saliva at a concentration of 8.69 μM (PMID: 15257879) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 2.35 μM (PMID: 15257879). It is found in lower levels in the evening, several hours after the onset of sleep. Cortisol is found to be associated with ACTH deficiency and glucocorticoid deficiency, which are inborn errors of metabolism. Blood cortisol levels in children between 2-17 year old are found to be significantly decreased in those with ACTH deficiency at a concentration of 0.22 μM (p = 0.022) compared to normal individuals with a concentration of 0.46 μM (PMID : 23705938). In adult individuals with glucocorticoid deficiency, blood cortisol levels are found to be significantly elevated where disease individuals have cortisol concentrations of 0.84 (0.68 - 0.99) μM compared to normal individuals with a cortisol concentration of 0.14 (0 - 0.28) μM (PMID : 2165347). Cortisol binds to the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor. After binding the receptor, the newly formed receptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA-bound receptor then interacts with basic transcription factors, causing the increase in expression of specific target genes. The anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition of arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Specifically, glucocorticoids induce lipocortin-1 (annexin-1) synthesis, which then binds to cell membranes and prevents phospholipase A2 from coming into contact with its substrate arachidonic acid. This leads to diminished eicosanoid production. The cyclooxygenase (both COX-1 and COX-2) expression is also suppressed, potentiating the effect. In other words, the two main products of inflammation, prostaglandins and leukotrienes, are inhibited by the action of glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids also stimulate the escape of lipocortin-1 into the extracellular space, where it binds to the leukocyte membrane receptors and inhibits various inflammatory events: epithelial adhesion, emigration, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, respiratory burst, and the release of various inflammatory mediators (lysosomal enzymes, cytokines, tissue plasminogen activator, chemokines, etc.) from neutrophils, macrophages, and mastocytes. Additionally, the immune system is suppressed by corticosteroids due to a decrease in the function of the lymphatic system, a reduction in immunoglobulin and complement concentrations, the precipitation of lymphocytopenia, and interference with antigen-antibody binding.",HMDB0000063,[H][C@@]12CC[C@@](O)(C(=O)CO)[C@@]1(C)C[C@H](O)[C@@]1([H])[C@@]2([H])CCC2=CC(=O)CC[C@]12C,C21H30O5,"1S/C21H30O5/c1-19-7-5-13(23)9-12(19)3-4-14-15-6-8-21(26,17(25)11-22)20(15,2)10-16(24)18(14)19/h9,14-16,18,22,24,26H,3-8,10-11H2,1-2H3/t14-,15-,16-,18+,19-,20-,21+/m0/s1",JYGXADMDTFJGBT-CZFMHFDVSA-N,"(1S,2R,10S,11S,14R,15S,17S)-14,17-dihydroxy-14-(2-hydroxyacetyl)-2,15-dimethyltetracyclo[8.7.0.0^{2,7}.0^{11,15}]heptadec-6-en-5-one",1.2751664346666671,13.86524229374907,362.4599,362.20932407,1.99e-01 g/l,1.79,-3.26,5,3,2,94.83000000000001,97.39999999999998,39.44944821309214,"(1S,2R,10S,11S,14R,15S,17S)-14,17-dihydroxy-14-(2-hydroxyacetyl)-2,15-dimethyltetracyclo[8.7.0.0^{2,7}.0^{11,15}]heptadec-6-en-5-one",0,0,-2.846864231895191,12.58472695897974,1,4,1,1,0,0,MDB00000044,"5194,5257,5277,5328,5360,5369,5403,5404,5405,5406,5415,5438,5465,5466"
33,Creatine,"Creatine is an amino acid that occurs in vertebrate tissues and in urine. In muscle tissue, creatine generally occurs as phosphocreatine. Creatine is excreted as creatinine in the urine. Creatine functions as part of the cell's energy shuttle. The high energy phosphate group of ATP is transferred to creatine to form phosphocreatine in the following reaction: Cr + ATP <-> PCr + ADP. This reaction is reversibly catalyzed by creatine kinase. In the human body creatine is synthesized mainly in the liver by the use of parts from three different amino acids - arginine, glycine, and methionine. 95% of it is later stored in the skeletal muscles, with the rest in the brain, heart, testes.↵",HMDB0000064,CN(CC(O)=O)C(N)=N,C4H9N3O2,"1S/C4H9N3O2/c1-7(4(5)6)2-3(8)9/h2H2,1H3,(H3,5,6)(H,8,9)",CVSVTCORWBXHQV-UHFFFAOYSA-N,2-(N-methylcarbamimidamido)acetic acid,-2.8642238844128185,,131.1332,131.069476547,4.11e+00 g/l,-1.59,-1.50,5,3,2,90.41,42.0127,12.170880209535248,creatine,0,0,12.429771248504041,3.501029063602651,1,0,1,0,0,0,MDB00000045,"5244,5263,5304,5324,5338,5440,5478,5481,5482,5513"
34,Cholesterol,"Cholesterol is a sterol (a combination steroid and alcohol) and a lipid found in the cell membranes of all body tissues and transported in the blood plasma of all animals. The name originates from the Greek chole- (bile) and stereos (solid), and the chemical suffix -ol for an alcohol. This is because researchers first identified cholesterol in solid form in gallstones in 1784. In the body, cholesterol can exist in either the free form or as an ester with a single fatty acid (of 10-20 carbons in length) covalently attached to the hydroxyl group at position 3 of the cholesterol ring. Due to the mechanism of synthesis, plasma cholesterol esters tend to contain relatively high proportions of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Most of the cholesterol consumed as a dietary lipid exists as cholesterol esters. Cholesterol esters have a lower solubility in water than cholesterol and are more hydrophobic. They are hydrolyzed by the pancreatic enzyme cholesterol esterase to produce cholesterol and free fatty acids. Cholesterol has vital structural roles in membranes and in lipid metabolism in general. It is a biosynthetic precursor of bile acids, vitamin D, and steroid hormones (glucocorticoids, estrogens, progesterones, androgens and aldosterone). In addition, it contributes to the development and functioning of the central nervous system, and it has major functions in signal transduction and sperm development. Cholesterol is a ubiquitous component of all animal tissues where much of it is located in the membranes, although it is not evenly distributed. The highest proportion of unesterified cholesterol is in the plasma membrane (roughly 30-50% of the lipid in the membrane or 60-80% of the cholesterol in the cell), while mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum have very low cholesterol contents. Cholesterol is also enriched in early and recycling endosomes, but not in late endosomes. The brain contains more cholesterol than any other organ where it comprises roughly a quarter of the total free cholesterol in the human body. Of all the organic constituents of blood, only glucose is present in a higher molar concentration than cholesterol. Cholesterol esters appear to be the preferred form for transport in plasma and as a biologically inert storage (de-toxified) form. They do not contribute to membranes but are packed into intracellular lipid particles. Cholesterol molecules (i.e. cholesterol esters) are transported throughout the body via lipoprotein particles. The largest lipoproteins, which primarily transport fats from the intestinal mucosa to the liver, are called chylomicrons. They carry mostly triglyceride fats and cholesterol that are from food, especially internal cholesterol secreted by the liver into the bile. In the liver, chylomicron particles give up triglycerides and some cholesterol. They are then converted into low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, which carry triglycerides and cholesterol on to other body cells. In healthy individuals, the LDL particles are large and relatively few in number. In contrast, large numbers of small LDL particles are strongly associated with promoting atheromatous disease within the arteries. (Lack of information on LDL particle number and size is one of the major problems of conventional lipid tests.). In conditions with elevated concentrations of oxidized LDL particles, especially small LDL particles, cholesterol promotes atheroma plaque deposits in the walls of arteries, a condition known as atherosclerosis, which is a major contributor to coronary heart disease and other forms of cardiovascular disease. There is a worldwide trend to believe that lower total cholesterol levels tend to correlate with lower atherosclerosis event rates (though some studies refute this idea). As a result, cholesterol has become a very large focus for the scientific community trying to determine the proper amount of cholesterol needed in a healthy diet. However, the primary association of atherosclerosis with cholesterol has always been specifically with cholesterol transport patterns, not total cholesterol per se. For example, total cholesterol can be low, yet made up primarily of small LDL and small HDL particles and atheroma growth rates are high. In contrast, however, if LDL particle number is low (mostly large particles) and a large percentage of the HDL particles are large (HDL is actively reverse transporting cholesterol), then atheroma growth rates are usually low, even negative, for any given total cholesterol concentration. These effects are further complicated by the relative concentration of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) in the endothelium since ADMA down-regulates production of nitric oxide, a relaxant of the endothelium. Thus, high levels of ADMA, associated with highly oxidized levels of LDL, pose a heightened risk factor for vascular disease. Chronically high levels of cholesterol are associated with at least five inborn errors of metabolism, including cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, cholesteryl ester storage disease, congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia, hypercholesterolemia, and Zellweger syndrome. Blood cholesterol ester levels are significantly elevated in individuals with hypercholesterolemia at a concentration of 5700.0 (5200.0-6200.0) μM compared to normal individuals with blood cholesterol ester concentrations of 2596.6 (0 - 5193.3) μM (PMID: 3422148). Cholesterol ester levels are also significantly elevated in individuals with Gallstone disease at a concentration of 16700 (14100-19300) uM compared to normal individuals at a concentration of 11500(10000-13000) uM (PMID: 8462368). This is as a result of inability of bile to break up excess cholesterol (PMID: 9412968). In chronically high levels, cholesterol can function as an atherogen (causes atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease). Specifically, chronically high levels (from diet or from genetic predisposition or from diseases such as hyperlipidemia) of cholesterol and cholesterol esters lead to an excess of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles. In healthy individuals, the LDL particles are large and relatively few in number. In contrast, large numbers of small LDL particles are strongly associated with promoting atheromatous disease within the arteries. In conditions with elevated concentrations of oxidized LDL particles, especially small LDL particles, cholesterol promotes atheroma plaque deposits in the walls of arteries, a condition known as atherosclerosis, which is a major contributor to coronary heart disease and other forms of cardiovascular disease. Resistin, a protein secreted by fat tissue, has been shown to increase the production of LDL in human liver cells and also degrades LDL receptors in the liver. As a result, the liver is less able to clear cholesterol from the bloodstream. Resistin accelerates the accumulation of LDL in arteries, increasing the risk of heart disease. Cholesterol is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and basic.",HMDB0000067,[H][C@@]12CC[C@H]([C@H](C)CCCC(C)C)[C@@]1(C)CC[C@@]1([H])[C@@]2([H])CC=C2CC(O)CC[C@]12C,C27H46O,"1S/C27H46O/c1-18(2)7-6-8-19(3)23-11-12-24-22-10-9-20-17-21(28)13-15-26(20,4)25(22)14-16-27(23,24)5/h9,18-19,21-25,28H,6-8,10-17H2,1-5H3/t19-,21?,22+,23-,24+,25+,26+,27-/m1/s1",HVYWMOMLDIMFJA-FNOPAARDSA-N,"(1S,2R,5S,10S,11S,14R,15R)-2,15-dimethyl-14-[(2R)-6-methylheptan-2-yl]tetracyclo[8.7.0.0^{2,7}.0^{11,15}]heptadec-7-en-5-ol",7.112889030666665,,386.6535,386.354866094,2.79e-05 g/l,7.02,-7.14,1,1,5,20.23,120.61649999999993,50.641441246997644,"(1S,2R,5S,10S,11S,14R,15R)-2,15-dimethyl-14-[(2R)-6-methylheptan-2-yl]tetracyclo[8.7.0.0^{2,7}.0^{11,15}]heptadec-7-en-5-ol",0,0,-1.3972437702926293,18.20428950550382,1,4,0,0,1,0,MDB00000046,"5234,5262,5265,5347,5348,5358,5360,5398,5444,5525,5539"

36,Pipecolic acid,"Pipecolic acid is a metabolite of lysine found in human physiological fluids such as urine, plasma and CSF. However, it is uncertain if pipecolic acid originates directly from food intake or from mammalian or intestinal bacterial enzyme metabolism. Recent studies suggest that plasma pipecolic acid, particularly the D-isomer, originates mainly from the catabolism of dietary lysine by intestinal bacteria rather than by direct food intake. Pipecolic acid is a biomarker for the consumption of dried and cooked beans. In classic Zellweger syndrome (a cerebro-hepato-renal genetic disorder, (OMIM 214100) pipecolic acid accumulates in the plasma of the patients. Pipecolic acid is found to be elevated in the blood of newborns (aged 0-30 days old) at a concentration of 9.22 μM compared to normal newborns at a concentration ranging from 0.540-2.460 μM (PMID : 9818927). It is known that plasma pipecolic acid levels are also elevated in patients with chronic liver diseases. Pipecolic acid is moderately elevated in patients with pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy and is found in concentrations of 2.8-23  μM compared to normal individuals at concentrations of 0.4-4.9  μM (PMID: 17068770). Therefore, pipecolic acid may provide as a possible biochemical marker for selecting candidates for pyridoxine therapy (PMID: 10894227). Pipecolic acid was also elevated in CSF in these vitamin B6-responsive patients (PMID 12705501). Pipecolic acid is found to be associated with adrenoleukodystrophy, infantile Refsum disease, and peroxisomal biogenesis defect, which are also inborn errors of metabolism.

39,Dopamine,"Dopamine is a member of the catecholamine family of neurotransmitters in the brain and is a precursor to epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). Dopamine is synthesized in the body (mainly by nervous tissue and adrenal glands) first by the hydration of the amino acid tyrosine to DOPA by tyrosine hydroxylase and then by the decarboxylation of DOPA by aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase. Dopamine is a major transmitter in the extrapyramidal system of the brain, and important in regulating movement. A family of receptors (dopamine receptors) mediates its action, which plays a major role in reward-motivated behaviour. Dopamine has many other functions outside the brain. In blood vessels, dopamine inhibits norepinephrine release and acts as a vasodilator (at normal concentrations); in the kidneys, it increases sodium excretion and urine output; in the pancreas, it reduces insulin production; in the digestive system, it reduces gastrointestinal motility and protects intestinal mucosa; and in the immune system, it reduces the activity of lymphocytes. Parkinson's disease, a degenerative condition causing tremor and motor impairment, is caused by a loss of dopamine-secreting neurons in an area of the midbrain called the substantia nigra. There is evidence that schizophrenia involves altered levels of dopamine activity, and most antipsychotic drugs used to treat this are dopamine antagonists, which reduce dopamine activity. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, and addiction are also characterized by defects in dopamine production or metabolism. It has been suggested that animals derived their dopamine-synthesizing machinery from bacteria via horizontal gene transfer that may have occurred relatively late in evolutionary time. This is perhaps a result of the symbiotic incorporation of bacteria into eukaryotic cells that gave rise to mitochondria. Dopamine is elevated in the urine of people who consume bananas. When present in sufficiently high levels, dopamine can be a neurotoxin and a metabotoxin. A neurotoxin is a compound that disrupts or attacks neural tissue. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Dopamine has shown to be chronically elevated in urine of individuals with neuroblastoma, Costello syndrome, leukaemia, phaeochromocytoma, aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency, and Menkes disease (MNK) (PMID: 15949155). Dopamine has also been found to be significantly elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid and plasma of Alzheimer’s disease patients in older age groups (PMID: 10494443). A study has shown that urinary dopamine is produced by Bacillus and Serratia (PMID: 24621061). High levels of dopamine can lead to hyperactivity, insomnia, agitation and anxiety, depression, delusions, excessive salivation, nausea, and digestive problems (PMID: 32670493).",HMDB0000073,NCCC1=CC(O)=C(O)C=C1,C8H11NO2,"1S/C8H11NO2/c9-4-3-6-1-2-7(10)8(11)5-6/h1-2,5,10-11H,3-4,9H2",VYFYYTLLBUKUHU-UHFFFAOYSA-N,"4-(2-aminoethyl)benzene-1,2-diol",0.029550238796553753,12.925186084800895,153.1784,153.078978601,7.43e+00 g/l,-0.40,-1.31,3,3,2,66.48,43.248200000000004,16.210926868007363,dopamine,0,1,9.271456202535882,10.007776384659529,1,1,1,0,0,0,MDB00000051,"5179,5185,5218,5259,5313,5331,5342,5371,5501"

47,Cytidine,"Cytidine is a nucleoside that is composed of the base cytosine linked to the five-carbon sugar D-ribose via a beta-N1-glycosidic bond. Cytidine is a pyrimidine that besides being incorporated into nucleic acids, can serve as substrate for the salvage pathway of pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis; as precursor of the cytidine triphosphate (CTP) needed in the phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) biosynthetic pathway. These variations probably reflect the species differences in cytidine deaminase, the enzyme that converts cytidine to uridine in the body. The transports of cytidine into the brain''s extracellular fluid, and then into neurons and glia, are essential prerequisites for cytidine to be utilized in brain. An efficient mechanism mediating the brain uptake of circulating cytidine has not yet been demonstrated. The biosynthesis of PC, the most abundant phosphatide in the brain, via the Kennedy pathway requires phosphocholine and cytidine triphosphate (CTP), a cytidine nucleotide, which is involved in the rate-limiting step. The enzyme that converts CTP to endogenous CDP-choline (CTP: phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase) is unsaturated at physiological brain CTP levels. APOBEC is a family of enzymes has been discovered with the ability to deaminate cytidines on RNA or DNA. The human apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like 3G (APOBEC3G, or hA3G) protein, provides cells with an intracellular antiretroviral activity that is associated with the hypermutation of viral DNA through cytidine deamination.

49,Citric acid,"Citric acid (citrate) is a tricarboxylic acid, an organic acid with three carboxylate groups. Citrate is an intermediate in the TCA cycle (also known as the Tricarboxylic Acid cycle, the Citric Acid cycle or Krebs cycle). The TCA cycle is a central metabolic pathway for all animals, plants, and bacteria. As a result, citrate is found in all living organisms, from bacteria to plants to animals. In the TCA cycle, the enzyme citrate synthase catalyzes the condensation of oxaloacetate with acetyl CoA to form citrate. Citrate then acts as the substrate for the enzyme known as aconitase (EC 4.2.1.3) and is then converted into aconitic acid. The TCA cycle ends with regeneration of oxaloacetate. This series of chemical reactions in the TCA cycle is the source of two-thirds of the food-derived energy in higher organisms. Citrate can be transported out of the mitochondria and into the cytoplasm, then broken down into acetyl-CoA for fatty acid synthesis, and into oxaloacetate. Citrate is a positive modulator of this conversion, and allosterically regulates the enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylase, which is the regulating enzyme in the conversion of acetyl-CoA into malonyl-CoA (the commitment step in fatty acid synthesis). In short, citrate is transported into the cytoplasm, converted into acetyl CoA, which is then converted into malonyl CoA by acetyl CoA carboxylase, which is allosterically modulated by citrate. In mammals and other vertebrates, citrate is a vital component of bone, helping to regulate the size of apatite crystals (PMID: 21127269 ). Citric acid is found in citrus fruits, most concentrated in lemons and limes, where it can comprise as much as 8% of the dry weight of the fruit. Citric acid is a natural preservative and is also used to add an acidic (sour) taste to foods and carbonated drinks. Because it is one of the stronger edible acids, the dominant use of citric acid is as a flavouring and preservative in food and beverages, especially soft drinks and candies. Citric acid is an excellent chelating agent, binding metals by making them soluble. It is used to remove and discourage the buildup of limescale from boilers and evaporators. It can be used to treat water, which makes it useful in improving the effectiveness of soaps and laundry detergents. The salts of citric acid (citrates) can be used as anticoagulants due to their calcium chelating ability. Intolerance to citric acid in the diet is known to exist. Little information is available as the condition appears to be rare, but like other types of food intolerance it is often described as a ""pseudo-allergic"" reaction. The evaluation of plasma citric acid is infrequently used in the diagnosis of human diseases. On the contrary, urinary citrate excretion is a common tool in the differential diagnosis of kidney stones, renal tubular acidosis and it also plays a role in bone diseases. Low urinary citrate excretion is a known risk factor for the development of kidney stones. Citrate inhibits stone formation by complexing with calcium in the urine, inhibiting spontaneous nucleation, and preventing growth and agglomeration of crystals. Hypocitraturia is a common metabolic abnormality found in 20% to 60% of stone formers (PMID: 19918339). In individuals with hypocitraturia, citric acid is found to be decreased at concentrations less than 320 mg (1.67 mmol) per day compared to normal individuals with concentrations ranging from 320 to 1,240 mg (PMID: 6823713, PMID: 19918339). Citric acid has also been looked into as a possible biomarker for prostate cancer (PMID: 35323711). It has been shown to be elevated in urine of individuals with prostate cancer at an average concentration of 0.00016 μM ± 0.00016 μM compared to normal individuals with an average concentration of 0.00006 ± 0.00006 μM (PMID: 35323711).

50,Choline,"Choline is a basic constituent of lecithin that is found in many plants and animal organs. It is important as a precursor of acetylcholine, as a methyl donor in various metabolic processes, and in lipid metabolism. Choline is now considered to be an essential vitamin. While humans can synthesize small amounts of choline (by converting phosphatidylethanolamine to phosphatidylcholine), it must be consumed in the diet to maintain health. Required levels are between 425 mg/day (female) and 550 mg/day (male). Milk, eggs, liver and peanuts are especially rich in choline. Most choline is found in phospholipids, namely phosphatidylcholine or lecithin. Choline can be oxidized to form betaine, which is a methyl source for many reactions (i.e. conversion of homocysteine e to methionine). Lack of sufficient amounts of choline in the diet can lead to a fatty liver condition and general liver damage. This arises from the lack of VLDL, which is necessary to transport fats away from the liver. Choline deficiency also leads to elevated serum levels of alanine amino transferase and is associated with increased incidence of liver cancer.↵",HMDB0000097,C[N+](C)(C)CCO,C5H14NO,"1S/C5H14NO/c1-6(2,3)4-5-7/h7H,4-5H2,1-3H3/q+1",OEYIOHPDSNJKLS-UHFFFAOYSA-N,(2-hydroxyethyl)trimethylazanium,-4.662269162805079,,104.1708,104.107539075,3.61e+00 g/l,-3.59,-1.59,1,1,2,20.23,42.194,12.56561305801337,choline,1,1,-3.249884462803304,13.968714076810006,1,0,1,0,1,0,MDB00000063,"5183,5186,5269,5271,5274,5304,5338"
51,D-Xylose,"D-Xylose or wood sugar is an aldopentose - a monosaccharide containing five carbon atoms and an aldehyde functional group. It has chemical formula C5H10O5 and is 40% as sweet as sucrose. Xylose is found in the embryos of most edible plants. The polysaccharide xylan, which is closely associated with cellulose, consists practically entirely of d-xylose. Corncobs, cottonseed hulls, pecan shells, and straw contain considerable amounts of this sugar. Xylose is also found in mucopolysaccharides of connective tissue and sometimes in the urine. Xylose is the first sugar added to serine or threonine residues during proteoglycan type O-glycosylation. Therefore xylose is involved in the biosynthetic pathways of most anionic polysaccharides such as heparan sulphate and chondroitin sulphate. In medicine, xylose is used to test for malabsorption by administering a xylose solution to the patient after fasting. If xylose is detected in the blood and/or urine within the next few hours, it has been absorbed by the intestines. Xylose is said to be one of eight sugars which are essential for human nutrition, the others being galactose, glucose, mannose, N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetylgalactosamine, fucose, and sialic acid. Xylose in the urine is a biomarker for the consumption of apples and other fruits. D-Xylose absorption testing has been used as a simple, low-cost method for screening small intestinal malabsorption (PMID: 11418788). In individuals (adult >18 years old) with kidney disease, blood D-Xylose levels are elevated at a concentration of 2911.1 +/- 752.4 μM compared to normal individuals at a concentration of 1797.5 +/- 328.2 μM (PMID: 11418788). D-Xylose has also been implicated in Crohn’s disease where disease individuals have elevated blood concentrations of D-Xylose at 3134.3 +/- 1248.3 μM compared to normal individuals at a D-Xylose concentration of 1797.33 (1458.74 - 2357.96) μM (PMID: 11418788).",HMDB0000098,O[C@@H]1COC(O)[C@H](O)[C@H]1O,C5H10O5,"1S/C5H10O5/c6-2-1-10-5(9)4(8)3(2)7/h2-9H,1H2/t2-,3+,4-,5?/m1/s1",SRBFZHDQGSBBOR-IOVATXLUSA-N,"(3R,4S,5R)-oxane-2,3,4,5-tetrol",-2.302204276,12.786263151759016,150.1299,150.05282343,1.22e+03 g/l,-2.57,0.91,5,4,0,90.15,29.9609,13.432709748510788,d-xylose,0,0,-3.5265718350182684,11.310624247742409,1,1,1,0,0,0,MDB00000064,"5288,5304"
52,L-Cystathionine,"Cystathionine is a dipeptide formed by serine and homocysteine. Cystathioninuria, which is characterized by the excretion of high amounts if cystathionine in the urine, is a prominent manifestation of vitamin-B6 deficiency. The transsulfuration of methionine yields homocysteine, which combines with serine to form cystathionine, the proximate precursor of cysteine through the enzymatic activity of cystathionase. In conditions in which cystathionine gamma-synthase or cystathionase is deficient, cystathioninuria will manifest. Although cystathionine has not been detected in normal human serum or plasma by most conventional methods, gas chromatographic/mass spectrometric methods have detected a mean concentration of cystathionine in normal human serum of 140 nM, with a range of 65 to 301 nM.

53,Deoxyadenosine,"Deoxyadenosine is a derivative of nucleoside adenosine. It is comprised of the purine adenine attached to a deoxyribose moiety via a beta-N9-glycosidic bond. Deoxyribose differs from ribose by the absence of oxygen in the 3' position of its ribose ring. It is similar to adenosine, but with one oxygen atom removed from the sugar ring. Deoxyadenosine is one of the four essential nucleoside components of DNA, and as such, is essential to all life. Deoxadenosine, upon sequential phosphorylation via kinases, forms dATP (deoxyATP) which is used by DNA polymerases synthesize DNA. In absence of the enzyme of adenosine deaminase (ADA) deoxyadenosine accumulates in T lymphocytes and kills these cells resulting in a genetic disorder known as adenosine deaminase severe combined immunodeficiency disease (ADA-SCID).",HMDB0000101,NC1=NC=NC2=C1N=CN2[C@H]1C[C@H](O)[C@@H](CO)O1,C10H13N5O3,"1S/C10H13N5O3/c11-9-8-10(13-3-12-9)15(4-14-8)7-1-5(17)6(2-16)18-7/h3-7,16-17H,1-2H2,(H2,11,12,13)/t5-,6+,7+/m0/s1",OLXZPDWKRNYJJZ-RRKCRQDMSA-N,"(2R,3S,5R)-5-(6-amino-9H-purin-9-yl)-2-(hydroxymethyl)oxolan-3-ol",-1.1903258086666668,14.785037392135134,251.2419,251.101839307,1.07e+01 g/l,-0.95,-1.37,7,3,2,119.30999999999999,61.68489999999999,24.236037685868787,2-deoxyadenosine,0,0,3.9409008296129784,13.886733808608756,1,3,1,0,0,0,MDB00000066,"5363,5364"
54,Ethanol,"Ethanol is a simple alcohol that appears as a clear, colorless liquid. Ethanol is naturally produced by the fermentation of sugars by yeasts or via petrochemical processes, and is commonly consumed in wines, beer and spirits. It is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and distributed throughout the body. It has bactericidal activity and is used often as a topical disinfectant. It is widely used as a solvent and preservative in pharmaceutical preparations as well as serving as the primary ingredient in alcoholic beverages. Indeed, ethanol has widespread use as a solvent of substances intended for human contact or consumption, including scents, flavorings, colorings, and medicines. Ethanol has a depressive effect on the central nervous system and because of its psychoactive effects, it is considered a drug. Ethanol has a complex mode of action and affects multiple systems in the brain, most notably it acts as an agonist to the GABA receptors. Death from ethanol consumption is possible when blood alcohol level reaches 0.4%. A blood level of 0.5% or more is commonly fatal. Levels of even less than 0.1% can cause intoxication, with unconsciousness often occurring at 0.3-0.4 %. Ethanol is metabolized by the body as an energy-providing carbohydrate nutrient, as it metabolizes into acetyl CoA, an intermediate common with glucose metabolism, that can be used for energy in the citric acid cycle or for biosynthesis. Ethanol within the human body is converted into acetaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase and then into acetic acid by acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. The product of the first step of this breakdown, acetaldehyde, is more toxic than ethanol. Acetaldehyde is linked to most of the clinical effects of alcohol. It has been shown to increase the risk of developing cirrhosis of the liver,[77] multiple forms of cancer, and alcoholism. Industrially, ethanol is produced both as a petrochemical, through the hydration of ethylene, and biologically, by fermenting sugars with yeast. Small amounts of ethanol are endogenously produced by gut microflora through anaerobic fermentation. However most ethanol detected in biofluids and tissues likely comes from consumption of alcoholic beverages. Absolute ethanol or anhydrous alcohol generally refers to purified ethanol, containing no more than one percent water. Absolute alcohol is not intended for human consumption. It often contains trace amounts of toxic benzene (used to remove water by azeotropic distillation). Consumption of this form of ethanol can be fatal over a short time period. Generally absolute or pure ethanol is used as a solvent for lab and industrial settings where water will disrupt a desired reaction. Pure ethanol is classed as 200 proof in the USA and Canada, equivalent to 175 degrees proof in the UK system.↵",HMDB0000108,CCO,C2H6O,"1S/C2H6O/c1-2-3/h3H,2H2,1H3",LFQSCWFLJHTTHZ-UHFFFAOYSA-N,ethanol,-0.1617691140000001,,46.0684,46.041864814,5.79e+02 g/l,-0.40,1.10,1,1,0,20.23,13.0099,5.303762677439426,ethyl alcohol,0,0,-2.155552890561707,16.47061524791562,1,0,1,0,1,0,MDB00000068,"5213,5258,5288,5338,5441,5467,5468"
55,Gamma-Aminobutyric acid,"Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a non-proteinogenic amino acid. It is an inhibitory neurotransmitter found in the nervous systems of widely divergent species. It is the chief inhibitory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate central nervous system. In vertebrates, GABA acts at inhibitory synapses in the brain. GABA acts by binding to specific transmembrane receptors in the plasma membrane of both pre- and postsynaptic neurons. This binding causes the opening of ion channels to allow either the flow of negatively charged chloride ions into the cell or positively-charged potassium ions out of the cell. This will typically result in a negative change in the transmembrane potential, usually causing hyperpolarization. Three general classes of GABA receptor are known. These include GABAA and GABAC ionotropic receptors, which are ion channels themselves, and GABAB metabotropic receptors, which are G protein-coupled receptors that open ion channels via intermediaries (G proteins). Neurons that produce GABA as their output are called GABAergic neurons, and have chiefly inhibitory action at receptors in the vertebrate. Medium Spiny Cells are a typical example of inhibitory CNS GABAergic cells. GABA exhibits excitatory actions in insects, mediating muscle activation at synapses between nerves and muscle cells and also the stimulation of certain glands. GABA has also been shown to have excitatory roles in the vertebrate, most notably in the developing cortex. Organisms synthesize GABA from glutamate using the enzyme L-glutamic acid decarboxylase and pyridoxal phosphate as a cofactor. It is worth noting that this involves converting the principal excitatory neurotransmitter (glutamate) into the principal inhibitory one (GABA). Drugs that act as agonists of GABA receptors (known as GABA analogues or GABAergic drugs) or increase the available amount of GABA typically have relaxing, anti-anxiety and anti-convulsive effects. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GABA) Doses of GABA 1 to 3 g orally also have been used effectively to raise the IQ of mentally retarded persons. GABA is found to be deficient in cerebrospinal fluid and brain in many studies of experimental and human epilepsy. Benzodiazepines (such as Valium) are useful in status epilepticus because they act on GABA receptors. GABA increases in the brain after administration of many seizure medications. Hence, GABA is clearly an antiepileptic nutrient. Inhibitors of GAM metabolism can also produce convulsions. Spasticity and involuntary movement syndromes, e.g., Parkinson's, Friedreich's ataxia, tardive dyskinesia, and Huntington's chorea are all marked by low GABA when amino acid levels are studied. Trials of 2 to 3 g of GABA given orally have been effective in various epilepsy and spasticity syndromes. Agents that elevate GABA also are useful in lowering hypertension. Three grams orally have been effective in control of blood pressure. GABA is decreased in various encephalopathies. GABA can reduce appetite and is decreased in hypoglycemics. GABA reduces blood sugar in diabetics. Chronic brain syndromes can also be marked by deficiency of GABA; GABA has many promising uses in therapy. Cerebrospinal fluid levels of GABA may be useful in diagnosing very serious diseases. Vitamin B6, manganese, taurine and lysine can increase both GABA synthesis and effects, while aspartic acid and glutamic acid probably inhibit GABA effects. (http://www.dcnutrition.com/AminoAcids/Detail.CFM)The brain's principal inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA, along with serotonin and norepinephrine, is one of several neurotransmitters that appear to be involved in the pathogenesis of anxiety and mood disorders. There are two principal subtypes of postsynaptic GABA receptor complexes, the GABA-A and GABA-B receptor complexes. Activation of the GABA-B receptor by GABA causes neuronal membrane hyperpolarization and a resultant inhibition of neurotransmitter release. In addition to binding sites for GABA, the GABA-A receptor has binding sites for benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and neurosteroids. GABA-A receptors are coupled to chloride ion channels; activation of the receptor induces increased inward chloride ion flux, resulting in membrane hyperpolarization and neuronal inhibition. After release into the synapse, free GABA that does not bind to either the GABA-A or GABA-B receptor complexes can be taken up by neurons and glial cells. Four different membrane transporter proteins, known as GAT-1, GAT-2, GAT-3, and BGT-1, which differ in their distribution in the CNS, are believed to mediate the uptake of synaptic GABA into neurons and glial cells. The GABA-A receptor subtype regulates neuronal excitability and rapid changes in fear arousal, such as anxiety, panic, and the acute stress response. Drugs that stimulate GABA-A receptors, such as the benzodiazepines and barbiturates, have anxiolytic and anti-seizure effects via GABA-A-mediated reduction of neuronal excitability, which effectively raises the seizure threshold. In support of the anticonvulsant and anxiolytic effects of the GABA-A receptor are findings that GABA-A antagonists produce convulsions in animals and the demonstration that there is decreased GABA-A receptor binding in a positron emission tomography (PET) study of patients with panic disorder. Low plasma GABA has been reported in some depressed patients and, in fact, may be a useful trait marker for mood disorders (The Role Of GABA In The Pathogenesis And Treatment Of Anxiety And Other Neuropsychiatric Disorders: http://www.vcu-cme.org/gaba/overview.html).↵",HMDB0000112,NCCCC(O)=O,C4H9NO2,"1S/C4H9NO2/c5-3-1-2-4(6)7/h1-3,5H2,(H,6,7)",BTCSSZJGUNDROE-UHFFFAOYSA-N,4-aminobutanoic acid,-2.8856771979836466,,103.1198,103.063328537,3.65e+02 g/l,-2.99,0.55,3,2,3,63.32,25.4578,10.620172993817706,gamma(amino)-butyric acid,0,0,10.21520969871372,4.527850005009431,1,0,1,0,0,0,MDB00000069,"5179,5183,5185,5199,5205,5228,5269,5319"
56,Glycolic acid,"Glycolic acid (or hydroxyacetic acid) is the smallest alpha-hydroxy acid (AHA). In its pure form, this colourless, odourless, and hygroscopic crystalline solid is highly soluble in water. Due to its excellent capability to penetrate skin, glycolic acid is often used in skin care products, most often as a chemical peel. It may reduce wrinkles, acne scarring, and hyperpigmentation and improve many other skin conditions, including actinic keratosis, hyperkeratosis, and seborrheic keratosis. Once applied, glycolic acid reacts with the upper layer of the epidermis, weakening the binding properties of the lipids that hold the dead skin cells together. This allows the outer skin to dissolve, revealing the underlying skin. It is thought that this is due to the reduction of calcium ion concentrations in the epidermis and the removal of calcium ions from cell adhesions, leading to desquamation. Glycolic acid is used in the textile industry as a dyeing and tanning agent, in food processing as a flavouring agent and as a preservative. It is also used for tattoo removal and is the active ingredient in the household cleaning liquid Pine-Sol. Glycolic acid is a known inhibitor of tyrosinase. This can suppress melanin formation and lead to a lightening of skin colour. Acute doses of glycolic acid on skin or eyes leads to local effects that are typical of a strong acid (e.g. dermal and eye irritation). Glycolate is a nephrotoxin if consumed orally. A nephrotoxin is a compound that causes damage to the kidney and kidney tissues. Glycolic acid's renal toxicity is due to its metabolism to oxalic acid. Glycolic and oxalic acid, along with excess lactic acid, are responsible for the anion gap metabolic acidosis. Oxalic acid readily precipitates with calcium to form insoluble calcium oxalate crystals. Renal tissue injury is caused by widespread deposition of oxalate crystals and the toxic effects of glycolic acid. Glycolic acid does exhibit some inhalation toxicity and can cause respiratory, thymus, and liver damage if present in very high levels over long periods of time. Elevated glycolic acid without elevated oxalic acid is most likely a result of GI yeast overgrowth (Aspergillus, Penicillium, probably Candida) or due to dietary sources containing glycerol (glycerine) (http://drweyrich.weyrich.com/labs/oat.html). Glycolic acid has also been found to be a metabolite in Acetobacter, Acidithiobacillus, Alcaligenes, Corynebacterium, Cryptococcus, Escherichia, Gluconobacter, Kluyveromyces, Leptospirillum, Pichia, Rhodococcus, Rhodotorula and Saccharomyces (PMID: 11758919 ; PMID: 26360870 ; PMID: 14390024 ). Ethylene glycol (C2H6O2) is a toxic alcohol that is found in various household and industrial agents and glycolic acid is the ​​major cause of the metabolic acidosis in this intoxication (PMID : 3337119). Specifically, individuals with Ethylene glycol poisoning show elevated blood levels of glycolic acid at a concentration of 48.0 (40.0 - 56.0) μM (PMID : 3337119). In patients with lung cancer, urine glycolic acid levels are elevated at a concentration of 23.0 (9.0-37.0) μmol/mmol creatinine compared to normal individuals at a concentration of 64.0 (21.0-107.0) μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID : 9267307). Glycolic acid is also implicated as a biomarker in Primary hyperoxaluria Type 1, a rare kidney disease that is caused by a deficiency of the liver peroxisomal enzyme alanine:glyoxylate-aminotransferase (AGT), which catalyzes the conversion of glyoxylate to glycine (PMID: 20301460). In individuals with Primary hyperoxaluria Type 1, urine levels of glycolic acid is significantly elevated at a concentration of 359.333 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID :705974) compared to normal individuals at a concentration of 35.0 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID : 2702744).",HMDB0000115,OCC(O)=O,C2H4O3,"1S/C2H4O3/c3-1-2(4)5/h3H,1H2,(H,4,5)",AEMRFAOFKBGASW-UHFFFAOYSA-N,2-hydroxyacetic acid,-1.0405937603333335,14.780077957574235,76.0514,76.016043994,6.08e+02 g/l,-1.02,0.90,3,2,1,57.53,14.345899999999999,6.195837007972227,glycolic acid,0,-1,-3.6133096708862027,3.526322592592504,1,0,1,0,0,0,MDB00000070,"5302,5304,5313,5327,5336,5343,5376,5423,5476"
57,Homovanillic acid,"Homovanillic acid (HVA), also known as homovanillate, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as methoxyphenols. Methoxyphenols are compounds containing a methoxy group attached to the benzene ring of a phenol moiety. HVA is also classified as a catechol. HVA is a major catecholamine metabolite occurring in human biofluids that is produced by a consecutive action of monoamine oxidase and catechol-O-methyltransferase on dopamine. HVA is typically elevated in patients with catecholamine-secreting tumors (such as neuroblastoma, pheochromocytoma, and other neural crest tumors). HVA levels are also used in monitoring patients who have been treated for these kinds of tumors. HVA levels may also be altered in disorders of catecholamine metabolism such as monoamine oxidase-A (MOA) deficiency. MOA deficiency can cause decreased urinary HVA values, while a deficiency of dopamine beta-hydrolase (the enzyme that converts dopamine to norepinephrine) can cause elevated urinary HVA values. Within humans, HVA participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, HVA and pyrocatechol can be biosynthesized from 3,4-dihydroxybenzeneacetic acid and guaiacol. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme known as catechol O-methyltransferase. In addition, HVA can be biosynthesized from homovanillin through the action of the enzyme known aldehyde dehydrogenase. HVA has recently been found in a number of beers and appears to arise from the fermentation process (https://doi.org/10.1006/fstl.1999.0593). HVA is also a metabolite of Bifidobacterium (PMID: 24958563 ) and the bacterial breakdown of dietary flavonoids. Dietary flavonols commonly found in tomatoes, onions, and tea, can lead to significantly elevated levels of urinary HVA (PMID: 20933512 ). Likewise, the microbial digestion of hydroxytyrosol (found in olive oil) can also lead to elevated levels of HVA in humans (PMID: 11929304 ). In psychiatry and neuroscience, brain and cerebrospinal fluid levels of HVA are measured as a marker of metabolic stress caused by 2-deoxy-D-glucose (PMID: 16806836 ). It is also implicated in schizophrenia where schizophrenic individuals have significantly decreased levels of HVA in the cerebrospinal fluid at a concentration of 110 +/- 68.6 μM compared to normal individuals at a concentration of 174 +/- 75.2 μM (PMID: 2415198). HVA is also implicated as a biomarker for hypothyroidism where it is found to be significantly decreased in the cerebrospinal fluid of individuals with hypothyroidism at a concentration of 0.00017 (0.00013-0.00022) μM (PMID: 9849813) compared to normal individuals at a concentration of 0.20 (0.047-0.35) μM (PMID: 16259647).",HMDB0000118,COC1=CC(CC(O)=O)=CC=C1O,C9H10O4,"1S/C9H10O4/c1-13-8-4-6(5-9(11)12)2-3-7(8)10/h2-4,10H,5H2,1H3,(H,11,12)",QRMZSPFSDQBLIX-UHFFFAOYSA-N,2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)acetic acid,1.1497575179999997,9.948757939292548,182.1733,182.057908808,2.72e+00 g/l,1.02,-1.83,4,2,3,66.76,45.8097,17.738134603087865,homovanillic acid,0,-1,-4.892538176084046,3.7448569898637887,1,1,1,1,0,0,MDB00000071,"5169,5177,5205,5210,5215,5226,5227,5255,5295,5298,5303,5306,5310,5313,5331,5345,5371,5372,5473,5501,5534,5535,5543"
58,Glyoxylic acid,"Glyoxylic acid or oxoacetic acid is an organic compound that is both an aldehyde and a carboxylic acid. Glyoxylic acid is a liquid with a melting point of -93°C and a boiling point of 111°C. It is an intermediate of the glyoxylate cycle, which enables certain organisms such as bacteria, fungi and plants to convert fatty acids into carbohydrates. The conjugate base of glyoxylic acid is known as glyoxylate (PMID: 16396466 ). In humans, glyoxylate is produced via two pathways: (1) through the oxidation of glycolate in peroxisomes and (2) through the catabolism of hydroxyproline in mitochondria. In the peroxisomes, glyoxylate is converted into glycine by glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT1) or into oxalate by glycolate oxidase. In the mitochondria, glyoxylate is converted into glycine by mitochondrial glyoxylate aminotransferase AGT2 or into glycolate by glycolate reductase. A small amount of glyoxylate is converted into oxalate by cytoplasmic lactate dehydrogenase. Glyoxylic acid is found to be associated with primary hyperoxaluria I, which is an inborn error of metabolism. Under certain circumstances, glyoxylate can be a nephrotoxin and a metabotoxin. A nephrotoxin is a compound that causes damage to the kidney and kidney tissues. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. High levels of glyoxylate are involved in the development of hyperoxaluria, a key cause of nephrolithiasis (commonly known as kidney stones). Glyoxylate is both a substrate and inductor of sulfate anion transporter-1 (SAT-1), a gene responsible for oxalate transportation, allowing it to increase SAT-1 mRNA expression, and as a result oxalate efflux from the cell. The increased oxalate release allows the buildup of calcium oxalate in the urine, and thus the eventual formation of kidney stones. As an aldehyde, glyoxylate is also highly reactive and will modify proteins to form advanced glycation products (AGEs). Glyoxylic acid is found to be associated with primary hyperoxaluria Type 1 where it is significantly elevated in urine of disease individuals (male adults > 18 years) at a concentration of 74 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID : 705974)  and compared to normal individuals (male adults > 18 years) at a concentration of 1.27 (0.46-3.26) μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 9869358). A similar trend is observed in children aged 1 - 13 years with primary hyperoxaluria Type 1 where they have shown to have elevated levels of glyoxylic acid in their urine at a concentration of 36-270 μmol/mmol creatinine compared to normal children at a concentration of 1.467 (0.467-3.933) μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID : 705974).",HMDB0000119,OC(=O)C=O,C2H2O3,"1S/C2H2O3/c3-1-2(4)5/h1H,(H,4,5)",HHLFWLYXYJOTON-UHFFFAOYSA-N,2-oxoacetic acid,-0.13367503833333333,,74.0355,74.00039393,2.24e+02 g/l,-0.59,0.48,3,1,1,54.37,13.5,5.350371249097624,glyoxylic acid,0,-1,-9.240766856996258,2.605312628420254,1,0,1,0,0,0,MDB00000072,5423
59,Folic acid,"Folic acid, also known as folate or vitamin B9, is member of the vitamin B family that stimulates the hematopoietic system. It is present in the liver and kidney and is found in mushrooms, spinach, yeast, green leaves, and grasses (poaceae). Folic acid, being biochemically inactive, is converted to the active forms, tetrahydrofolic acid and methyltetrahydrofolate by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase. These folic acid congeners are transported across cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis where they are needed to maintain normal erythropoiesis, synthesize purine and thymidylate nucleic acids, interconvert amino acids, methylated tRNA, and generate and use formate. Folic acid is used in the treatment and prevention of folate deficiencies and megaloblastic anemia. Folic acid is also used as a supplement by women during pregnancy to reduce the risk of neural tube defects (NTDs) in babies.

60,D-Glucose,"Glucose is a monosaccharide containing six carbon atoms and an aldehyde group. Therefore it is referred to as an aldohexose. The glucose molecule can exist in an open-chain (acyclic) and ring (cyclic) form, the latter being the result of an intramolecular reaction between the aldehyde C atom and the C-5 hydroxyl group to form an intramolecular hemiacetal. In water solution both forms are in equilibrium and at pH 7 the cyclic one is the predominant. Glucose is the primary source of energy for living organisms. It is naturally occurring and is found in fruits and other parts of plants in its free state. Glucose is mainly made by plants and most algae during photosynthesis from water and carbon dioxide, using energy from sunlight, where it is used to make cellulose in cell walls. However, most glucose does not occur in its free form, but in the form of its polymers, i.e. lactose, sucrose, starch and glycogen which are energy reserve substances, and cellulose and chitin, which are components of the cell wall in plants or fungi and arthropods, respectively. In animals, glucose arises from the breakdown of glycogen in a process known as glycogenolysis. Glucose can be synthesized in the liver and kidneys from non-carbohydrate intermediates, such as pyruvate and glycerol, by a process known as gluconeogenesis. Ingested glucose initially binds to the receptor for sweet taste on the tongue in humans. This complex of the proteins T1R2 and T1R3 makes it possible to identify glucose-containing food sources. Glucose mainly comes from food - about 300 g per day are produced by conversion of carbohydrates to glucose. In order to get into or out of cell membranes of cells and membranes of cell compartments, glucose requires special transport proteins including GLUT1, GLUT2 and GLUT3 which are expressed in different cells and tissues. In humans, glucose is metabolised by glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway. It can also be fermented by bacteria in the gut. Glucose is a ubiquitous fuel in biology. It is used as an energy source in organisms, from bacteria to humans, through either aerobic respiration, anaerobic respiration (in bacteria), or fermentation. Glucose is the human body's key source of energy, through aerobic respiration, providing about 3.75 kilocalories (16 kilojoules) of food energy per gram. Glucose supplies almost all the energy for the brain. The blood sugar content of a healthy person in the short-time fasting state, e.g. after overnight fasting, is about 70 to 100 mg/dL of blood (4 to 5.5 mM). In blood plasma, the measured values are about 10–15% higher.  Dysregulated metabolism of glucose can lead to a number of diseases including diabetes. Diabetes is a metabolic disorder where the body is unable to regulate levels of glucose in the blood either because of a lack of insulin in the body or the failure, by cells in the body, to respond properly to insulin. Each of these situations can be caused by persistently high elevations of blood glucose levels, through pancreatic burnout and insulin resistance.",HMDB0000122,OC[C@H]1OC(O)[C@H](O)[C@@H](O)[C@@H]1O,C6H12O6,"1S/C6H12O6/c7-1-2-3(8)4(9)5(10)6(11)12-2/h2-11H,1H2/t2-,3-,4+,5-,6?/m1/s1",WQZGKKKJIJFFOK-GASJEMHNSA-N,"(2R,3R,4S,5S,6R)-6-(hydroxymethyl)oxane-2,3,4,5-tetrol",-2.932539218,12.687538461190869,180.1559,180.063388116,7.82e+02 g/l,-2.57,0.64,6,5,1,110.38000000000001,35.9234,16.354519229394423,glucoside,0,0,-2.9810792051782764,11.298101552080594,1,1,1,0,0,0,MDB00000074,"5199,5200,5203,5230,5261,5277,5338,5347,5348,5357,5360,5410,5421,5438,5444,5449,5455,5466,5477,5507,5524,5529,5536,5546,5555"
61,Glycine,"Glycine (Gly), is an alpha-amino acid. These are amino acids in which the amino group is attached to the carbon atom immediately adjacent to the carboxylate group (alpha carbon). Amino acids are organic compounds that contain amino (-NH2) and carboxyl (-COOH) functional groups, along with a side chain (R group) specific to each amino acid. Glycine is one of 20 proteinogenic amino acids, i.e., the amino acids used in the biosynthesis of proteins. Glycine is found in all organisms ranging from bacteria to plants to animals. It is classified as an aliphatic, non-polar amino acid and is the simplest of all amino acids. In humans, glycine is a nonessential amino acid, although experimental animals show reduced growth on low-glycine diets. The average adult human ingests 3 to 5 grams of glycine daily. Glycine is a colorless, sweet-tasting crystalline solid. It is the only achiral proteinogenic amino acid. Glycine was discovered in 1820 by the French chemist Henri Braconnot when he hydrolyzed gelatin by boiling it with sulfuric acid. The name comes from the Greek word glucus or ""sweet tasting"". Glycine is biosynthesized in the body from the amino acid serine, which is in turn derived from 3-phosphoglycerate. In the liver of vertebrates, glycine synthesis is catalyzed by glycine synthase (also called glycine cleavage enzyme). In addition to being synthesized from serine, glycine can also be derived from threonine, choline or hydroxyproline via inter-organ metabolism of the liver and kidneys. Glycine is degraded via three pathways. The predominant pathway in animals and plants is the reverse of the glycine synthase pathway. In this context, the enzyme system involved in glycine metabolism is called the glycine cleavage system. The glycine cleavage system catalyzes the oxidative conversion of glycine into carbon dioxide and ammonia, with the remaining one-carbon unit transferred to folate as methylenetetrahydrofolate. It is the main catabolic pathway for glycine and it also contributes to one-carbon metabolism. Patients with a deficiency of this enzyme system have increased glycine in plasma, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with an increased CSF:plasma glycine ratio (PMID: 16151895 ). Glycine levels are effectively measured in plasma in both normal patients and those with inborn errors of glycine metabolism (http://www.dcnutrition.com/AminoAcids/). Nonketotic hyperglycinaemia (OMIM: 606899 ) is an autosomal recessive condition caused by deficient enzyme activity of the glycine cleavage enzyme system (EC 2.1.1.10). The glycine cleavage enzyme system comprises four proteins: P-, T-, H- and L-proteins (EC 1.4.4.2, EC 2.1.2.10, and EC 1.8.1.4 for P-, T-, and L-proteins). Mutations have been described in the GLDC (OMIM: 238300 ), AMT (OMIM: 238310 ), and GCSH (OMIM: 238330 ) genes encoding the P-, T-, and H-proteins respectively. Glycine is involved in the body's production of DNA, hemoglobin, and collagen, and in the release of energy. The principal function of glycine is as a precursor to proteins. Most proteins incorporate only small quantities of glycine, a notable exception being collagen, which contains about 35% glycine. In higher eukaryotes, delta-aminolevulinic acid, the key precursor to porphyrins (needed for hemoglobin and cytochromes), is biosynthesized from glycine and succinyl-CoA by the enzyme ALA synthase. Glycine provides the central C2N subunit of all purines, which are key constituents of DNA and RNA. Glycine is an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, especially in the spinal cord, brainstem, and retina. When glycine receptors are activated, chloride enters the neuron via ionotropic receptors, causing an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP). Glycine is associated with D-glyceric acidemia and Glucoglycinuria which are metabolic disorders. In adults > 18 years old with D-glyceric acidemia, glycine is found to be significantly elevated in the blood at a concentration of 486.0 (232.0-740.0) μM (MetaGene) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 220.0 (120.0-320.0) μM (PMID: 23430553). Glycine is also found to be elevated in the urine of children aged 1 - 13 years with glucoglycinuria at a concentration of 1039.229 μmol/mmol creatinine compared to normal children at a concentration <300 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 4434100). Glycine levels have also been shown to play a role in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and Schizophrenia. In adult (>18 years old) with AD, glycine is significantly reduced in the cerebrospinal fluid at a concentration of 0.28 +/- 0.12 μM (PMID: 17031479) compared to normal adults with a glycine concentration of 6.1 +/- 1.4 μM (PMID: 22546835). A similar trend is observed in adult (>18 years old) with schizophrenia where glycine is reduced in the cerebrospinal fluid at a concentration of 4.5 +/- 0.75 μM compared to normal adults  with a glycine concentration of 4.63 +/- 0.74 μM (PMID: 7595563).",HMDB0000123,NCC(O)=O,C2H5NO2,"1S/C2H5NO2/c3-1-2(4)5/h1,3H2,(H,4,5)",DHMQDGOQFOQNFH-UHFFFAOYSA-N,2-aminoacetic acid,-3.409459573132419,,75.0666,75.032028409,5.52e+02 g/l,-3.34,0.87,3,2,1,63.31999999999999,16.0034,6.647019971293048,glycine,0,0,9.240341660583645,2.3074568824727444,1,0,1,0,0,0,MDB00000075,"5170,5171,5183,5184,5185,5186,5204,5205,5206,5223,5232,5233,5238,5239,5247,5258,5267,5268,5269,5291,5301,5304,5306,5313,5338,5402,5412,5457,5510,5521,5523,5531,5532,5542,5543"

63,Glutathione,"Glutathione (GSH) is a tripeptide consisting of glutamate, cysteine and glycine. It consists of a gamma peptide linkage between the carboxyl group of the glutamate side chain and cysteine. The carboxyl group of the cysteine residue is attached by normal peptide linkage to glycine. Glutathione is perhaps the most important member of the body's toxic waste disposal team. Like cysteine, glutathione contains the crucial thiol (-SH) group that makes it an effective antioxidant. It plays a key role in preventing damage to important cellular components caused by reactive oxygen species such as free radicals, peroxides, lipid peroxides, and heavy metals. Because of its importance in preventing oxidative damage, scientists have speculated that glutathione was essential to the development of aerobic life on earth. Glutathione has many roles; and is a coenzyme in various enzymatic reactions. The most important of these are redox reactions, in which the thiol grouping on the cysteine portion of cell membranes protects against peroxidation; and conjugation reactions, in which glutathione (especially in the liver) binds with toxic chemicals in order to detoxify them. glutathione is also important in red and white blood cell formation and throughout the immune system. glutathione's clinical uses include the prevention of oxygen toxicity in hyperbaric oxygen therapy, treatment of lead and other heavy metal poisoning, lowering of the toxicity of chemotherapy and radiation in cancer treatments, and reversal of cataracts. (http://www.dcnutrition.com/AminoAcids/) Glutathione participates in leukotriene synthesis and is a cofactor for the enzyme glutathione peroxidase. It is also important as a hydrophilic molecule that is added to lipophilic toxins and lipophilic wastes in the liver during biotransformation before they can become part of the bile. Glutathione is also needed for the detoxification of methylglyoxal, a toxin produced as a by-product of metabolism. This detoxification reaction is carried out by the glyoxalase system. Glyoxalase I (EC 4.4.1.5) catalyzes the conversion of methylglyoxal and reduced glutathione to S-D-Lactoyl-glutathione. Glyoxalase II (EC 3.1.2.6) catalyzes the hydrolysis of S-D-Lactoyl-glutathione to glutathione and D-lactate. GSH is known as a substrate in both conjugation reactions and reduction reactions, catalyzed by glutathione S-transferase enzymes in cytosol, microsomes, and mitochondria. However, it is also capable of participating in non-enzymatic conjugation with some chemicals, as in the case of n-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), the reactive cytochrome P450-reactive metabolite formed by acetaminophen, that becomes toxic when GSH is depleted by an overdose (of acetaminophen). glutathione in this capacity binds to NAPQI as a suicide substrate and in the process detoxifies it, taking the place of cellular protein thiol groups which would otherwise be covalently modified; when all GSH has been spent, NAPQI begins to react with the cellular proteins, killing the cells in the process. The preferred treatment for an overdose of this painkiller is the administration (usually in atomized form) of N-acetylcysteine, which is used by cells to replace spent GSSG and renew the usable GSH pool.

It is a metabolite in the Urea cycle and metabolism of amino groups, and in the metabolic pathways of several amino acids. This includes glycine, serine, threonine, arginine and proline metabolism. Guanidinacetic acid is formed in mammals primarily in the kidneys by transferring the guanidine group of L-arginine via the enzyme L-Arg:Gly-amidinotransferase (AGAT) to the amino acid glycine. From L-arginine, ornithine is thus produced, which is metabolized in the urea cycle by carbamoylation to citrulline. Guanidinoacetic acid is also a precursor of creatine, an essential substrate for muscle energy metabolism. It is used as a supplement and as a feed additive in poultry farming.

The resulting homogentisic acid is then broken down into 4-maleylacetoacetate via the enzyme homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase. Homogentisic acid is also found in other organisms. For instance, it can be found in Arbutus unedo (strawberry-tree) honey, in the bacterial plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris as well as in the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica where it is associated with the production of brown pigments. Homogentisic acid can be oxidatively dimerized to form hipposudoric acid, one of the main constituents of the 'blood sweat' of hippopotamuses. When present in sufficiently high levels, homogentisic acid can function as an osteotoxin and a renal toxin. An osteotoxin is a substance that causes damage to bones and/or joints. A renal toxin causes damage to the kidneys. Chronically high levels of homogentisic acid are associated with alkaptonuria (OMIM: 203500), an inborn error of metabolism. Alkaptonuria is a rare inherited genetic disorder in which the body cannot process the amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine. It is caused by a mutation in the enzyme homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.5), which leads to an accumulation of homogentisic acid in the blood and tissues. In individuals with alkaptonuria, homogentisic acid is elevated in the blood of adults at a concentration of 35.5 (33.0 - 38.0) μM compared to normal individuals at a concentration of 0.043 (0.014-0.071) μM (PMID: 8925087). Homogentisic acid and its oxidised form benzoquinone acetic acid are excreted in the urine, giving it an unusually dark colour. The accumulating homogentisic acid (and benzoquinone acetic acid) causes damage to cartilage (ochronosis, leading to osteoarthritis) and heart valves as well as precipitating as kidney stones and stones in other organs. More specifically, homogentisic acid can be converted to benzoquinone acetic acid (BQA), and the resulting BQA can be readily converted to polymers that resemble the dark skin pigment melanin. These polymers are deposited in the collagen, a connective tissue protein, of particular tissues such as cartilage. This process is called ochronosis (as the tissue looks ochre); ochronotic tissue is stiffened and unusually brittle, impairing its normal function and causing damage. Homogentisic acid is the primary precursor of melanin synthesis in Vibrio cholerae.",HMDB0000130,OC(=O)CC1=C(O)C=CC(O)=C1,C8H8O4,"1S/C8H8O4/c9-6-1-2-7(10)5(3-6)4-8(11)12/h1-3,9-10H,4H2,(H,11,12)",IGMNYECMUMZDDF-UHFFFAOYSA-N,"2-(2,5-dihydroxyphenyl)acetic acid",1.0038634619999998,9.566007893833087,168.1467,168.042258744,8.10e+00 g/l,0.81,-1.32,4,3,2,77.75999999999999,41.3274,15.568374170369944,homogentisic acid,0,-1,-5.895788377591718,3.57380421430248,1,1,1,1,0,0,MDB00000081,5313
67,Glycerol,"Glycerol is a simple polyol compound and it exists as a colorless, odorless, viscous liquid with a sweet taste. It is highly soluble in water. The glycerol backbone is found in lipids, and is an important component of triglycerides (i.e. fats and oils) as well as other glycerides. Glycerol is a precursor for synthesis of triacylglycerols and of phospholipids in the liver and adipose tissue. When the body uses stored fat as a source of energy, glycerol and fatty acids are released into the bloodstream. The glycerol component can be converted to glucose by the liver and provides energy for cellular metabolism. As a result, glycerol can also be used as an effective marker to measure liver disease. Blood glycerol levels are highly elevated during diabetes, and is believed to be the cause of reduced fertility in patients who suffer from diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Blood glycerol levels in diabetic patients average three times higher than healthy controls. Direct glycerol treatment of testes has been found to cause significant long-term reduction in sperm count. Glycerol is widely used in many industrial and pharmaceutical applications. Due to its antimicrobial and antiviral properties glycerol is widely used in FDA approved wound and burn treatments. It is also widely used as a sweetener in the food industry and as a humectant in pharmaceutical formulations.",HMDB0000131,OCC(O)CO,C3H8O3,"1S/C3H8O3/c4-1-3(6)2-5/h3-6H,1-2H2",PEDCQBHIVMGVHV-UHFFFAOYSA-N,"propane-1,2,3-triol",-1.8390140226666665,15.167747933654137,92.0938,92.047344122,1.17e+03 g/l,-1.93,1.10,3,3,2,60.69,20.516099999999998,8.934349980067854,glycerol,0,0,-2.9679773519640786,13.605499310321004,1,0,1,0,0,0,MDB00000082,"5200,5313,5338,5440,5441"
68,Guanine,"Guanine is one of the five main nucleobases found in the nucleic acids DNA and RNA. Guanine is a purine derivative, consisting of a fused pyrimidine-imidazole ring system with conjugated double bonds. Being unsaturated, the bicyclic molecule is planar. The guanine nucleoside is called guanosine. The first isolation of guanine was reported in 1844 from the excreta of sea birds, known as guano, which was used as a source of fertilizer. High affinity binding of guanine nucleotides and the ability to hydrolyze bound GTP to GDP are characteristics of an extended family of intracellular proteins. Guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins may be involved in the activation of phospholipases C and A2 by hormones and other ligands. The binding of hormones to receptors that activate phospholipase C is decreased by guanine nucleotides and these hormones also stimulate a high-affinity GTPase activity in cell membranes. Effects of hormones on phospholipase C activity in cell-free preparations are dependent on the presence of guanine nucleotides. Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT, EC 2.4.2.8) is a purine salvage enzyme that catalyses the conversion of hypoxanthine and guanine to their respective mononucleotides. Partial deficiency of this enzyme can result in the overproduction of uric acid leading to a severe form of gout, whilst a virtual absence of HPRT activity causes the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome which is characterised by hyperuricaemia, mental retardation, choreoathetosis and compulsive self-mutilation. Peroxynitrite induces DNA base damage predominantly at guanine (G) and 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) nucleobases via oxidation reactions. G and 8-oxoG are the most reactive bases toward Peroxynitrite and possibly the major contributors to peroxynitrite-derived genotoxic and mutagenic lesions. The neutral G radical, reacts with NO2 to yield 8-nitroguanine and 5-nitro-4-guanidinohydantoin (PMIDs: 16352449, 2435586, 2838362, 1487231).↵",HMDB0000132,NC1=NC(=O)C2=C(N1)N=CN2,C5H5N5O,"1S/C5H5N5O/c6-5-9-3-2(4(11)10-5)7-1-8-3/h1H,(H4,6,7,8,9,10,11)",UYTPUPDQBNUYGX-UHFFFAOYSA-N,"2-amino-6,7-dihydro-3H-purin-6-one",-0.5893389343333332,11.536910677452525,151.1261,151.049409807,2.31e+00 g/l,-0.92,-1.82,5,3,0,96.16,38.9011,13.339986140369138,2-aminohypoxanthine,0,0,2.2167738264968646,8.949155880456997,1,2,1,0,0,0,MDB00000083,"5183,5388"
69,Guanosine,"Guanosine is a nucleoside comprising guanine attached to a ribose (ribofuranose) ring via a beta-N9-glycosidic bond. Guanosine can be phosphorylated to become GMP (guanosine monophosphate), cGMP (cyclic guanosine monophosphate), GDP (guanosine diphosphate) and GTP (guanosine triphosphate) (Wikipedia). The nucleoside guanosine exert important neuroprotective and neuromodulator roles in the central nervous system, which may be related to inhibition of the glutamatergic neurotransmission activity. Guanosine is the specific extracellular guanine-based purines effector and indicate that its conversion occurs not only in the central nervous system but also peripherally (PMID: 16325434).↵",HMDB0000133,NC1=NC2=C(N=CN2[C@@H]2O[C@H](CO)[C@@H](O)[C@H]2O)C(=O)N1,C10H13N5O5,"1S/C10H13N5O5/c11-10-13-7-4(8(19)14-10)12-2-15(7)9-6(18)5(17)3(1-16)20-9/h2-3,5-6,9,16-18H,1H2,(H3,11,13,14,19)/t3-,5-,6-,9-/m1/s1",NYHBQMYGNKIUIF-UUOKFMHZSA-N,"2-amino-9-[(2R,3R,4S,5R)-3,4-dihydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)oxolan-2-yl]-6,9-dihydro-1H-purin-6-one",-2.706218196,12.456833616816144,283.2407,283.091668551,1.53e+01 g/l,-2.06,-1.27,8,5,2,155.22000000000003,64.62109999999998,26.0315249439995,guanosine,0,0,0.4462064218132451,10.15572249859448,1,3,1,0,0,0,MDB00000084,"5209,5313"
70,Fumaric acid,"Fumaric acid is a dicarboxylic acid. Dicarboxylic acids are a class of organic acids that have two carboxylate groups. Fumarate exists as a white solid and occurs widely in nature. It has a fruit-like taste and has been used as a food additive. It is a precursor to L-malate in the Krebs tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle .It is also a metabolite of Aspergillus. It is formed by the oxidation of succinic acid by succinate dehydrogenase. Fumarate is converted by the enzyme fumarase to malate. Fumarate is also a product of the urea cycle and is produced when human skin is exposed to sunlight. Fumaric acid has recently been identified as an oncometabolite or an endogenous, cancer causing metabolite. High levels of this organic acid can be found in tumors or biofluids surrounding tumors. Its oncogenic action appears to be due to its ability to inhibit prolyl hydroxylase-containing enzymes. In many tumors, oxygen availability becomes limited (hypoxia) very quickly due to rapid cell proliferation and limited blood vessel growth. The major regulator of the response to hypoxia is the HIF transcription factor (HIF-alpha). Under normal oxygen levels, protein levels of HIF-alpha are very low due to constant degradation, mediated by a series of post-translational modification events catalyzed by the prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing enzymes PHD1, 2 and 3, (also known as EglN2, 1 and 3) that hydroxylate HIF-alpha and lead to its degradation. All three of the PHD enzymes are inhibited by fumarate. Fumaric acid is found to be associated with fumarase deficiency, which is an inborn error of metabolism. In male infants with fumarase deficiency, fumaric acid is found to be elevated in urine at a concentration of 313.400-493.200 μmol/mmol creatinine compared to normal male infants that have a fumaric acid concentration <25 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 24182348). Significantly reduced levels of fumaric acid have also been found in the urine of individuals with lung cancer at a concentration of 0.7 (0.0-4.0) μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 18953024) compared to normal individuals with a fumaric acid concentration of 0.95 +/- 0.93 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 2026685).",HMDB0000134,OC(=O)\C=C\C(O)=O,C4H4O4,"1S/C4H4O4/c5-3(6)1-2-4(7)8/h1-2H,(H,5,6)(H,7,8)/b2-1+",VZCYOOQTPOCHFL-OWOJBTEDSA-N,(2E)-but-2-enedioic acid,-0.040914331333333324,4.412485134930334,116.0722,116.010958616,2.41e+01 g/l,0.21,-0.68,4,2,2,74.6,24.607,9.352250335599845,fumaric acid,0,-2,,3.545732417201611,1,0,1,0,0,0,MDB00000085,"5186,5304,5313,5343,5432,5445,5504,5521"
71,Glycocholic acid,"Glycocholic acid is an acyl glycine and a bile acid-glycine conjugate. It is a secondary bile acid produced by the action of enzymes existing in the microbial flora of the colonic environment. Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium and Lactobacillus are involved in bile acid metabolism and produce glycocholic acid (PMID: 6265737 ; 10629797). In hepatocytes, both primary and secondary bile acids undergo amino acid conjugation at the C-24 carboxylic acid on the side chain, and almost all bile acids in the bile duct therefore exist in a glycine conjugated form (PMID: 16949895 ). More specifically, glycocholic acid or cholylglycine, is a crystalline bile acid involved in the emulsification of fats. It occurs as a sodium salt in the bile of mammals. Its anion is called glycocholate. As the glycine conjugate of cholic acid, this compound acts as a detergent to solubilize fats for absorption and is itself absorbed (PubChem). Bile acids are steroid acids found predominantly in bile of mammals. The distinction between different bile acids is minute, depending only on presence or absence of hydroxyl groups on positions 3, 7, and 12. Bile acids are physiological detergents that facilitate excretion, absorption, and transport of fats and sterols in the intestine and liver. Bile acids are also steroidal amphipathic molecules derived from the catabolism of cholesterol. They exist as anions at physiological pH and, consequently, require a carrier for transport across the membranes of the enterohepatic tissues. They also modulate bile flow and lipid secretion, are essential for the absorption of dietary fats and vitamins, and have been implicated in the regulation of all the key enzymes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Bile acids recirculate through the liver, bile ducts, small intestine and portal vein to form an enterohepatic circuit. They exist as anions at physiological pH and, consequently, require a carrier for transport across the membranes of the enterohepatic tissues. The unique detergent properties of bile acids are essential for the digestion and intestinal absorption of hydrophobic nutrients. Bile acids have potent toxic properties (e.g., membrane disruption) and there are a plethora of mechanisms to limit their accumulation in blood and tissues (PMID: 11316487 , 16037564 , 12576301 , 11907135 ). Glycocholic acid is primarily found to be associated with diseases of the liver. Specifically, glycocholic acid is found to be associated with alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, which is an inborn error of metabolism. In children (1-13 years old) with alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, blood glycocholic acid levels are shown to be significantly elevated at a concentration of 25.9 +/- 24.0 μM compared to the concentration in normal children at 0.88 +/- 0.26 μM (PMID: 7119120). Glycocholic acid is also found to be associated with celiac disease and is found to be significantly elevated in the blood of adults (>18 years old) at a concentration of 0.7 +/- 0.13 μM compared to normal adults at a concentration of 0.06 +/- 0.04 μM (PMID: 3816078). A similar trend is observed in children (1-13 years old) with glycogen storage disease where blood glycocholic acid levels are shown to be significantly elevated at a concentration of 8.6 +/- 7.9 μM compared to normal children at a concentration of 0.88 +/- 0.26 μM (PMID: 7119120).",HMDB0000138,[H][C@@]12CC[C@H]([C@H](C)CCC(=O)NCC(O)=O)[C@@]1(C)[C@@H](O)C[C@@]1([H])[C@@]2([H])[C@H](O)CC2C[C@H](O)CC[C@]12C,C26H43NO6,"1S/C26H43NO6/c1-14(4-7-22(31)27-13-23(32)33)17-5-6-18-24-19(12-21(30)26(17,18)3)25(2)9-8-16(28)10-15(25)11-20(24)29/h14-21,24,28-30H,4-13H2,1-3H3,(H,27,31)(H,32,33)/t14-,15?,16-,17-,18+,19+,20-,21+,24+,25+,26-/m1/s1",RFDAIACWWDREDC-MZMBZMQMSA-N,"2-[(4R)-4-[(1S,2S,5R,7S,9R,10R,11S,14R,15R,16S)-5,9,16-trihydroxy-2,15-dimethyltetracyclo[8.7.0.0^{2,7}.0^{11,15}]heptadecan-14-yl]pentanamido]acetic acid",1.3772112169999984,15.694897850593033,465.6227,465.309038113,,,,6,5,6,127.09,123.59279999999995,52.79738571393794,"[(4R)-4-[(1S,2S,5R,7S,9R,10R,11S,14R,15R,16S)-5,9,16-trihydroxy-2,15-dimethyltetracyclo[8.7.0.0^{2,7}.0^{11,15}]heptadecan-14-yl]pentanamido]acetic acid",0,-1,-0.13936410783518716,3.7733200967259095,1,4,1,0,0,1,MDB00000086,"5214,5502"
72,Glyceric acid,"Glyceric acid is a colourless syrupy acid, obtained from oxidation of glycerol. It is a compound that is secreted excessively in the urine by patients suffering from D-glyceric aciduria, an inborn error of metabolism, and D-glycerate anemia. Deficiency of human glycerate kinase leads to D-glycerate acidemia/D-glyceric aciduria. Symptoms of the disease include progressive neurological impairment, hypotonia, seizures, failure to thrive, and metabolic acidosis. At sufficiently high levels, glyceric acid can act as an acidogen and a metabotoxin. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Glyceric acid is an organic acid. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart abnormalities, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of untreated glyceric aciduria. Many affected children with organic acidemias experience intellectual disability or delayed development. In adults, acidosis or acidemia is characterized by headaches, confusion, feeling tired, tremors, sleepiness, and seizures. Elevated values may also be due to microbial sources such as yeast (Aspergillus, Penicillium, probably Candida) or due to dietary sources containing glycerol (glycerine). Glyceric acid is isolated from various plants (e.g. brassicas, pulses, and Vicia faba). D-glyceric aciduria is a metabolic disorder characterized by D-glyceric acid excretion. A deficiency in glycerate kinase activity leads to the accumulation of D-glyceric acid (a.k.a. D-glycerate) in bodily fluids and tissues. It has been described in several patients and clinical findings suggest progressive neurological impairment, hypotonia, seizures, failure to thrive and metabolic acidosis. In children (1-13 years old) with D-glyceric aciduria, D-glyceric acid is significantly elevated in both blood and urine samples. In blood samples of children with D-glyceric aciduria, glyceric acid is found at an elevated concentration of 186-315 μM (PMID: 2165585) compared to normal children at a concentration <5 μM (PMID: 21359215). In urine samples of children with D-glyceric aciduria, glyceric acid is found at a significantly elevated concentration of 2900-5220 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 2165585) compared to normal children at a concentration of 5.3 (0.1-37.3) μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 8087979). Glyceric acid has also been shown to be associated with primary hyperoxaluria Type 1, a rare and detrimental disease that mainly affects the kidneys. It is found to be significantly decreased in the urine of adults (>18 years) at a concentration of 2.4e+03 (1.2-1.4e+03) μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 9267307) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 14.4 (7.8-28.8) μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 24023812).",HMDB0000139,OC[C@@H](O)C(O)=O,C3H6O4,"1S/C3H6O4/c4-1-2(5)3(6)7/h2,4-5H,1H2,(H,6,7)/t2-/m1/s1",RBNPOMFGQQGHHO-UWTATZPHSA-N,"(2R)-2,3-dihydroxypropanoic acid",-1.5187394846666669,13.495349861440904,106.0773,106.02660868,6.39e+02 g/l,-1.72,0.78,4,3,2,77.76,20.383499999999998,8.95589682155052,glycerate,0,-1,-3.042760876836586,3.4186061267841343,1,0,1,0,0,0,MDB00000087,5423
73,Formic acid,"Formic acid is the simplest carboxylic acid and is an intermediate in normal metabolism. It takes part in the metabolism of one-carbon compounds and its carbon may appear in methyl groups undergoing transmethylation. It is eventually oxidized to carbon dioxide. Formate is typically produced as a byproduct in the production of acetate. It is responsible for both metabolic acidosis and disrupting mitochondrial electron transport and energy production by inhibiting cytochrome oxidase activity, the terminal electron acceptor of the electron transport chain. Cell death from cytochrome oxidase inhibition by formate is believed to result partly from depletion of ATP, reducing energy concentrations so that essential cell functions cannot be maintained. Furthermore, inhibition of cytochrome oxidase by formate may also cause cell death by increased production of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) secondary to the blockade of the electron transport chain. In nature, formic acid is found in the stings and bites of many insects of the order Hymenoptera, including bees and ants. The principal use of formic acid is as a preservative and antibacterial agent in livestock feed. When sprayed on fresh hay or other silage, it arrests certain decay processes and causes the feed to retain its nutritive value longer.↵",HMDB0000142,OC=O,CH2O2,"1S/CH2O2/c2-1-3/h1H,(H,2,3)",BDAGIHXWWSANSR-UHFFFAOYSA-N,formic acid,-0.2720444223333333,,46.0254,46.005479308,4.77e+02 g/l,-0.47,1.02,2,1,0,37.3,8.1532,3.374057914916533,formic acid,0,-1,,4.2691179843154865,1,0,1,0,1,0,MDB00000089,"5258,5304,5338,5440,5441"
74,L-Glutamic acid,"Glutamic acid (Glu), also referred to as glutamate (the anion), is one of the 20 proteinogenic amino acids. It is not among the essential amino acids. Glutamate is a key molecule in cellular metabolism. In humans, dietary proteins are broken down by digestion into amino acids, which serves as metabolic fuel or other functional roles in the body. Glutamate is the most abundant fast excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian nervous system. At chemical synapses, glutamate is stored in vesicles. Nerve impulses trigger release of glutamate from the pre-synaptic cell. In the opposing post-synaptic cell, glutamate receptors, such as the NMDA receptor, bind glutamate and are activated. Because of its role in synaptic plasticity, it is believed that glutamic acid is involved in cognitive functions like learning and memory in the brain. Glutamate transporters are found in neuronal and glial membranes. They rapidly remove glutamate from the extracellular space. In brain injury or disease, they can work in reverse and excess glutamate can accumulate outside cells. This process causes calcium ions to enter cells via NMDA receptor channels, leading to neuronal damage and eventual cell death, and is called excitotoxicity. The mechanisms of cell death include: * Damage to mitochondria from excessively high intracellular Ca2+. * Glu/Ca2+-mediated promotion of transcription factors for pro-apoptotic genes, or downregulation of transcription factors for anti-apoptotic genes. Excitotoxicity due to glutamate occurs as part of the ischemic cascade and is associated with stroke and diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, lathyrism, and Alzheimer's disease. glutamic acid has been implicated in epileptic seizures. Microinjection of glutamic acid into neurons produces spontaneous depolarization around one second apart, and this firing pattern is similar to what is known as paroxysmal depolarizing shift in epileptic attacks.

76,Estradiol,"Estradiol (E2) is an estrogen steroid hormone and is the major female sex hormone. It is the most potent form of mammalian estrogenic steroids. Estradiol is produced in the ovaries, but also in other tissues including the testicles, the adrenal glands, fat, liver, the breasts, and the brain. Estradiol is produced in the body from cholesterol. The major pathway involves the formation of androstenedione, which is then converted by aromatase into estrone and is subsequently converted into estradiol. Estradiol is responsible for the development of female secondary sexual characteristics such as the breasts, widening of the hips, and a female-associated pattern of fat distribution and is important in the development and maintenance of female reproductive tissues such as the mammary glands, uterus, and vagina during puberty, adulthood, and pregnancy. It also has important effects in many other tissues including bone, fat, skin, liver, and the brain. Though estradiol levels in males are much lower than in females, estradiol has important roles in males as well. Upon menopause in females, production of estrogens by the ovaries stops and estradiol levels decrease to very low levels. In addition to its role as a natural hormone, estradiol is used as a medication, for instance in menopausal hormone therapy. Estradiol is a potent endogenous antioxidant which suppresses hepatic fibrosis in animal models, and attenuates induction of redox sensitive transcription factors, hepatocyte apoptosis and hepatic stellate cells activation by inhibiting a generation of reactive oxygen species in primary cultures. This suggests that the greater progression of hepatic fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in men and postmenopausal women may be due, at least in part, to lower production of estradiol and a reduced response to the action of estradiol. estradiol has been reported to induce the production of interferon (INF)-gamma in lymphocytes, and augments an antigen-specific primary antibody response in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. IFN-gamma is a potent cytokine with immunomodulatory and antiproliferative properties. Therefore, female subjects, particularly before menopause, may produce antibodies against hepatitis B virus E antigen and hepatitis B virus surface antigen at a higher frequency than males with chronic hepatitis B virus infection. The estradiol-Dihydrotestosterone model of prostate cancer (PC) proposes that the first step in the development of most PC and breast cancer (BC) occurs when aromatase converts testosterone to estradiol (PMID: 17708600, 17678531, 17644764).↵",HMDB0000151,[H][C@@]12CC[C@H](O)[C@@]1(C)CC[C@]1([H])C3=C(CC[C@@]21[H])C=C(O)C=C3,C18H24O2,"1S/C18H24O2/c1-18-9-8-14-13-5-3-12(19)10-11(13)2-4-15(14)16(18)6-7-17(18)20/h3,5,10,14-17,19-20H,2,4,6-9H2,1H3/t14-,15-,16+,17+,18+/m1/s1",VOXZDWNPVJITMN-ZBRFXRBCSA-N,"(1S,10R,11S,14S,15S)-15-methyltetracyclo[8.7.0.0^{2,7}.0^{11,15}]heptadeca-2(7),3,5-triene-5,14-diol",3.745501328333334,19.37769223665565,272.382,272.177630012,2.13e-02 g/l,3.57,-4.11,2,2,0,40.46,79.9047,32.12316248072682,"(1S,10R,11S,14S,15S)-15-methyltetracyclo[8.7.0.0^{2,7}.0^{11,15}]heptadeca-2(7),3,5-triene-5,14-diol",0,0,-0.8839974156894889,10.327060716263132,1,4,1,1,0,0,MDB00000095,"5277,5314,5328,5393,5403,5405,5465"

The latter metabolites can be formed in the brain and may compete with receptors for catecholamines. Metabolites are conjugated with sulfate or glucuronide before excretion by the kidney. During pregnancy, estriol constitutes 60-70% of the total estrogens, increasing to 300-500-fold in relation to non-pregnant women. The late term human fetus produces relatively large amounts of 16 alpha-hydroxy DHEA, which serves the mother as a precursor of estriol. It has been shown that 90% of the precursors for the formation of estriol are of fetal origin. If abnormal maternal serum screening results, specifically low levels of unconjugated estriol in the second trimester are detected, a diagnosis of Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) or RSH is suspected.

79,L-Malic acid,"Malic acid is a tart-tasting organic dicarboxylic acid that plays a role in many sour or tart foods. Apples contain malic acid, which contributes to the sourness of a green apple. Malic acid can make a wine taste tart, although the amount decreases with increasing fruit ripeness (wikipedia). In its ionized form malic acid is called malate. Malate is an intermediate of the TCA cycle along with fumarate. It can also be formed from pyruvate as one of the anaplerotic reactions. In humans, malic acid is both derived from food sources and synthesized in the body through the citric acid cycle or Krebs cycle which takes place in the mitochondria. Malate's importance to the production of energy in the body during both aerobic and anaerobic conditions is well established. Under aerobic conditions, the oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate provides reducing equivalents to the mitochondria through the malate-aspartate redox shuttle. During anaerobic conditions, where a buildup of excess of reducing equivalents inhibits glycolysis, malic acid's simultaneous reduction to succinate and oxidation to oxaloacetate is capable of removing the accumulating reducing equivalents. This allows malic acid to reverse hypoxia's inhibition of glycolysis and energy production. In studies on rats it has been found that only tissue malate is depleted following exhaustive physical activity. Other key metabolites from the citric acid cycle needed for energy production were found to be unchanged. Because of this, a deficiency of malic acid has been hypothesized to be a major cause of physical exhaustion. Notably, the administration of malic acid to rats has been shown to elevate mitochondrial malate and increase mitochondrial respiration and energy production.↵",HMDB0000156,O[C@@H](CC(O)=O)C(O)=O,C4H6O5,"1S/C4H6O5/c5-2(4(8)9)1-3(6)7/h2,5H,1H2,(H,6,7)(H,8,9)/t2-/m0/s1",BJEPYKJPYRNKOW-REOHCLBHSA-N,(2S)-2-hydroxybutanedioic acid,-1.1136414279999998,5.127730317344291,134.0874,134.021523302,2.18e+02 g/l,-0.87,0.21,5,3,3,94.83,24.8752,10.926274075509982,(-)-malic acid,0,-2,-3.913035238851454,3.1983571934669475,1,0,1,0,0,0,MDB00000098,"5173,5183,5313,5445,5492,5547"
80,Hypoxanthine,"Hypoxanthine, also known as purine-6-ol or Hyp, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as purines. Purines are a bicyclic aromatic compound made up of a pyrimidine ring fused to an imidazole ring. Hypoxanthine is also classified as an oxopurine, Hypoxanthine is a naturally occurring purine derivative and a reaction intermediate in the metabolism of adenosine and in the formation of nucleic acids by the nucleotide salvage pathway. Hypoxanthine exists in all living species, ranging from bacteria to plants to humans. Hypoxanthine has been detected, but not quantified in, several different foods, such as radish (var.), mountain yams, welsh onions, greenthread tea, and common beets. Hypoxanthine is occasionally found as a constituent of nucleic acids, where it is present in the anticodon of tRNA in the form of its nucleoside inosine. Biologically, hypoxanthine can be formed in a number of ways. For instance, it is one of the products of the action of xanthine oxidase on xanthine. However, more frequently xanthine is formed from oxidation of hypoxanthine by xanthine oxidoreductase. The enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase converts hypoxanthine into IMP in the nucleotide salvage pathway. Hypoxanthine is also a spontaneous deamination product of adenine. Under normal circumstances hypoxanthine is readily converted to uric acid. In this process, hypoxanthine is first oxidized to xanthine, which is further oxidized to uric acid by xanthine oxidase. Molecular oxygen, the oxidant in both reactions, is reduced to H2O2 and other reactive oxygen species. In humans, uric acid is the final product of purine degradation and is excreted in the urine. Within humans, hypoxanthine participates in a number of other enzymatic reactions. In particular, hypoxanthine and ribose 1-phosphate can be biosynthesized from inosine through its interaction with the enzyme purine nucleoside phosphorylase. Hypoxanthine is also involved in the metabolic disorder called the purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency. Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) deficiency is a disorder of the immune system (primary immunodeficiency) characterized by recurrent infections, neurologic symptoms, and autoimmune disorders. PNP deficiency causes a shortage of white blood cells, called T-cells, that help fight infection. Affected individuals develop neurologic symptoms, such as stiff or rigid muscles (spasticity), uncoordinated movements (ataxia), developmental delay, and intellectual disability. PNP deficiency is associated with an increased risk to develop autoimmune disorders, such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), autoimmune neutropenia, thyroiditis, and lupus.

81,L-Tyrosine,"Tyrosine (Tyr) is an essential amino acid that readily passes the blood-brain barrier. Once in the brain, it is a precursor for the neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine, better known as adrenalin. These neurotransmitters are an important part of the body's sympathetic nervous system, and their concentrations in the body and brain are directly dependent upon dietary tyrosine. Tyrosine is not found in large concentrations throughout the body, probably because it is rapidly metabolized. Folic acid, copper and vitamin C are cofactor nutrients of these reactions. Tyrosine is also the precursor for hormones, thyroid, catecholestrogens and the major human pigment, melanin. Tyrosine is an important amino acid in many proteins, peptides and even enkephalins, the body's natural pain reliever. Valine and other branched amino acids, and possibly tryptophan and phenylalanine may reduce tyrosine absorption. A number of genetic errors of tyrosine metabolism occur. Most common is the increased amount of tyrosine in the blood of premature infants, which is marked by decreased motor activity, lethargy and poor feeding. Infection and intellectual deficits may occur. Vitamin C supplements reverse the disease. Some adults also develop elevated tyrosine in their blood. This indicates a need for more vitamin C. More tyrosine is needed under stress, and tyrosine supplements prevent the stress-induced depletion of norepinephrine and can cure biochemical depression. However, tyrosine may not be good for psychosis. Many antipsychotic medications apparently function by inhibiting tyrosine metabolism. L-dopa, which is directly used in Parkinson's, is made from tyrosine. Tyrosine, the nutrient, can be used as an adjunct in the treatment of Parkinson's. Peripheral metabolism of tyrosine necessitates large doses of tyrosine, however, compared to L-dopa.

82,L-Phenylalanine,"Phenylalanine (Phe) is an essential amino acid and the precursor for the amino acid tyrosine. Like tyrosine, it is the precursor of catecholamines in the body (tyramine, dopamine, epinephrine and norepinephrine). The psychotropic drugs (mescaline, morphine, codeine, and papaverine) also have phenylalanine as a constituent. Phenylalanine is a precursor of the neurotransmitters called catecholamines, which are adrenalin-like substances. Phenylalanine is highly concentrated in the human brain and plasma. Normal metabolism of phenylalanine requires biopterin, iron, niacin, vitamin B6, copper and vitamin C. An average adult ingests 5 g of phenylalanine per day and may optimally need up to 8 g daily. Phenylalanine is highly concentrated in high protein foods, such as meat, cottage cheese and wheat germ. A new dietary source of phenylalanine is artificial sweeteners containing aspartame. Aspartame appears to be nutritious except in hot beverages; however, it should be avoided by phenylketonurics and pregnant women. Phenylketonurics, who have a genetic error of phenylalanine metabolism, have elevated serum plasma levels of phenylalanine up to 400 times normal. Mild phenylketonuria can be an unsuspected cause of hyperactivity, learning problems, and other developmental problems in children. Phenylalanine can be an effective pain reliever. Its use in premenstrual syndrome and Parkinson's may enhance the effects of acupuncture and electric transcutaneous nerve stimulation (TENS). Phenylalanine and tyrosine, like L-dopa, produce a catecholamine effect. Phenylalanine is better absorbed than tyrosine and may cause fewer headaches. Low phenylalanine diets have been prescribed for certain cancers with mixed results. Some tumors use more phenylalanine (particularly melatonin-producing tumors called melanoma). One strategy is to exclude this amino acid from the diet, i.e., a Phenylketonuria (PKU) diet (compliance is a difficult issue; it is hard to quantify and is under-researched). The other strategy is just to increase phenylalanine's competing amino acids, i.e., tryptophan, valine, isoleucine and leucine, but not tyrosine.

Plasma alanine is often decreased when the BCAA (Branched Chain Amino Acids) are deficient. This finding may relate to muscle metabolism. Alanine is highly concentrated in meat products and other high-protein foods like wheat germ and cottage cheese. Alanine is an important participant as well as regulator in glucose metabolism. Alanine levels parallel blood sugar levels in both diabetes and hypoglycemia, and alanine reduces both severe hypoglycemia and the ketosis of diabetes. It is an important amino acid for lymphocyte reproduction and immunity. Alanine therapy has helped dissolve kidney stones in experimental animals.

85,Methylamine,"Methylamine occurs endogenously from amine catabolism and its tissue levels increase in some pathological conditions, including diabetes. Interestingly, methylamine and ammonia levels are reciprocally controlled by a semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase activity that deaminates methylamine to formaldehyde with the production of ammonia and hydrogen peroxide. Methylamine also targets the voltage-operated neuronal potassium channels, probably inducing release of neurotransmitter(s). Semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO) catalyzes the deamination of primary amines. Such deamination has been shown capable of regulating glucose transport in adipose cells. It has been independently discovered that the primary structure of vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1) is identical to SSAO. Increased serum SSAO activities have been found in patients with diabetic mellitus, vascular disorders and Alzheimer's disease. The SSAO-catalyzed deamination of endogenous substrates like methylamine led to production of toxic formaldehyde. Chronic elevated methylamine increases the excretion of malondialdehyde and microalbuminuria. Amine oxidase substrates such as methylamine have been shown to stimulate glucose uptake by increasing the recruitment of the glucose transporter GLUT4 from vesicles within the cell to the cell surface. Inhibition of this effect by the presence of semicarbazide and catalase led to the suggestion that the process is mediated by the H (2) O (2) produced in the oxidation of these amines.

86,L-Threonine,"Threonine (Thr) is an essential amino acid in humans. It is abundant in human plasma, particularly in newborns. Severe deficiency of threonine causes neurological dysfunction and lameness in experimental animals. Threonine is an immunostimulant which promotes the growth of thymus gland. It also can probably promote cell immune defense function. This amino acid has been useful in the treatment of genetic spasticity disorders and multiple sclerosis at a dose of 1 gram daily. It is highly concentrated in meat products, cottage cheese and wheat germ. (http://www.dcnutrition.com/AminoAcids/) The threonine content of most of the infant formulas currently on the market is approximately 20% higher than the threonine concentration in human milk. Due to this high threonine content the plasma threonine concentrations are up to twice as high in premature infants fed these formulas than in infants fed human milk. The whey proteins which are used for infant formulas are sweet whey proteins. Sweet whey results from cheese production. Threonine catabolism in mammals appears to be due primarily (70-80%) to the activity of threonine dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.103) that oxidizes threonine to 2-amino-3-oxobutyrate, which forms glycine and acetyl CoA, whereas threonine dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.16) that catabolizes threonine into 2-oxobutyrate and ammonia, is significantly less active. Increasing the threonine plasma concentrations leads to accumulation of threonine and glycine in the brain. Such accumulation affects the neurotransmitter balance which may have consequences for the brain development during early postnatal life. Thus, excessive threonine intake during infant feeding should be avoided (PMID 9853925).↵",HMDB0000167,C[C@@H](O)[C@H](N)C(O)=O,C4H9NO3,"1S/C4H9NO3/c1-2(6)3(5)4(7)8/h2-3,6H,5H2,1H3,(H,7,8)/t2-,3+/m1/s1",AYFVYJQAPQTCCC-GBXIJSLDSA-N,"(2S,3R)-2-amino-3-hydroxybutanoic acid",-3.4709635238772347,14.953369305664726,119.1192,119.058243159,4.77e+02 g/l,-3.01,0.60,4,3,2,83.55,26.4598,11.078258022254147,L-threonine,0,0,9.002504827404067,2.207432028688761,1,0,1,0,0,0,MDB00000106,"5183,5184,5237,5269,5306,5309,5313,5402,5409,5504,5505,5542"
87,L-Asparagine,"Asparagine (Asn) is one of the 20 most common natural amino acids on Earth. It has carboxamide as the side chain's functional group. It is considered a non-essential amino acid. Asparagine is not an essential amino acid, which means that it can be synthesized from central metabolic pathway intermediates in humans and is not required in the diet. The precursor to asparagine is oxaloacetate. Oxaloacetate is converted to aspartate using a transaminase enzyme. The enzyme transfers the amino group from glutamate to oxaloacetate producing alpha-ketoglutarate and aspartate. The enzyme asparagine synthetase produces asparagine, AMP, glutamate, and pyrophosphate from aspartate, glutamine, and ATP. In the asparagine synthetase reaction, ATP is used to activate aspartate, forming beta-aspartyl-AMP. glutamine donates an ammonium group which reacts with beta-aspartyl-AMP to form asparagine and free AMP. Since the asparagine side chain can make efficient hydrogen bond interactions with the peptide backbone, asparagines are often found near the beginning and end of alpha-helices, and in turn motifs in beta sheets. Its role can be thought as ""capping"" the hydrogen bond interactions which would otherwise need to be satisfied by the polypeptide backbone. glutamines have an extra methylene group, have more conformational entropy and thus are less useful in this regard. Asparagine also provides key sites for N-linked glycosylation, modification of the protein chain with the addition of carbohydrate chains. A reaction between asparagine and reducing sugars or reactive carbonyls produces acrylamide (acrylic amide) in food when heated to sufficient temperature, i.e. baking. These occur primarily in baked goods such as french fries, potato chips, and roasted coffee. Asparagine was first isolated in 1806 from asparagus juice, in which it is abundant--hence its name--becoming the first amino acid to be isolated. The smell observed in the urine of some individuals after their consumption of asparagus is attributed to a byproduct of the metabolic breakdown of asparagine, asparagine-amino-succinic-acid monoamide. (However, some scientists disagree and implicate other substances in the smell, especially methanethiol) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asparagine).↵",HMDB0000168,N[C@@H](CC(N)=O)C(O)=O,C4H8N2O3,"1S/C4H8N2O3/c5-2(4(8)9)1-3(6)7/h2H,1,5H2,(H2,6,7)(H,8,9)/t2-/m0/s1",DCXYFEDJOCDNAF-REOHCLBHSA-N,(2S)-2-amino-3-carbamoylpropanoic acid,-4.287830841089268,16.09048069675879,132.1179,132.053492132,1.68e+02 g/l,-3.36,0.10,4,3,3,106.41,28.354899999999997,11.677080187792834,L-asparagine,0,0,8.433487205020553,1.9985390993927763,1,0,1,0,0,0,MDB00000107,"5186,5313,5338,5402,5504,5505"
88,L-Isoleucine,"L-Isoleucine (Ile) is an essential branched chaine amino acid. Branched chain amino acids (BCAA) are essential amino acids whose carbon structure is marked by a branch point. They include isoleucine, leucine and valine. These three amino acids are critical to human life and are particularly involved in stress, energy and muscle metabolism. BCAA supplementation as therapy, both oral and intravenous, in human health and disease holds great promise. ""BCAA"" denotes valine, isoleucine and leucine which are branched chain essential amino acids. Despite their structural similarities, the branched amino acids have different metabolic routes, with valine going solely to carbohydrates, leucine solely to fats and isoleucine to both. The different metabolism accounts for different requirements for these essential amino acids in humans: 12 mg/kg, 14 mg/kg and 16 mg/kg of valine, leucine and isoleucine respectively. Furthermore, these amino acids have different deficiency symptoms. Valine deficiency is marked by neurological defects in the brain, while isoleucine deficiency is marked by muscle tremors. BCAA are decreased in patients with liver disease, such as hepatitis, hepatic coma, cirrhosis, extrahepatic biliary atresia or portacaval shunt; aromatic amino acids (AAA)-tyrosine, tryptophan and phenylalanine, as well as methionine-are increased in these conditions. Valine, in particular, has been established as a useful supplemental therapy to the ailing liver. All the BCAA probably compete with AAA for absorption into the brain. Supplemental BCAA with vitamin B6 and zinc help normalize the BCAA:AAA ratio. The BCAA are not without side effects. Leucine alone, for example, exacerbates pellagra and can cause psychosis in pellagra patients by increasing excretion of niacin in the urine. Leucine may lower brain serotonin and dopamine. A dose of 3 g of isoleucine added to the niacin regime has cleared leucine-aggravated psychosis in schizophrenic patients. Isoleucine may have potential as an antipsychotic treatment. Leucine is more highly concentrated in foods than other amino acids. A cup of milk contains 800 mg of leucine and only 500 mg of isoleucine and valine. A cup of wheat germ has about 1.6 g of leucine and 1 g of isoleucine and valine. The ratio evens out in eggs and cheese. One egg and an ounce of most cheeses each contain about 400 mg of leucine and 400 mg of valine and isoleucine. The ratio of leucine to other BCAA is greatest in pork, where leucine is 7 to 8 g and the other BCAA together are only 3 to 4 g.

89,Maleic acid,"Maleic acid is an industrial raw material for the production of glyoxylic acid by ozonolysis. Maleic acid is an organic compound which is a dicarboxylic acid (molecule with two carboxyl groups). The molecule consists of an ethylene group flanked by two carboxylic acid groups. Maleic acid is the cis isomer of butenedioic acid, whereas fumaric acid is the trans isomer. The cis isomer is the less stable one of the two; the difference in heat of combustion is 22.7 kJ/mol. The physical properties of maleic acid are very different from that of fumaric acid. Maleic acid is soluble in water whereas fumaric acid is not and the melting point of maleic acid (130 - 131 degree centigrade) is also much lower than that of fumaric acid (287 degree centigrade). Both properties of maleic acid can be explained on account of the intramolecular hydrogen bonding that takes place at the expense of intermolecular interactions. Maleic acid is converted into maleic anhydride by dehydration, to malic acid by hydration, and to succinic acid by hydrogenation. It reacts with thionyl chloride or phosphorus pentachloride to give the maleic acid chloride (it is not possible to isolate the mono acid chloride).

90,L-Histidine,"Histidine (His) is an essential amino acid for infants but not adults. Infants four to six months old require 33 mg/kg of histidine. It is not clear how adults make small amounts of histidine, and dietary sources probably account for most of the histidine in the body. Inborn errors of histidine metabolism exist and are marked by increased histidine levels in the blood. Elevated blood histidine is accompanied by a wide range of symptoms, from mental and physical retardation to poor intellectual functioning, emotional instability, tremor, ataxia and psychosis. Histidine in medical therapies has its most promising trials in rheumatoid arthritis where up to 4.5 g daily have been used effectively in severely affected patients. Arthritis patients have been found to have low serum histidine levels, apparently because of too-rapid removal of histidine from their blood. Histidine and other imidazole compounds have anti-inflammatory properties. histidine may accomplish this function through a complex interaction with threonine or cysteine and possibly copper. However, copper is usually elevated in rheumatoid arthritis patients and worsens the disease. Other patients besides arthritis patients that have been found to be low in serum histidine are those with chronic renal failure. Histidine has been claimed to have been useful in hypertension because of its vasodilatory effects. Claims of its use to improve libido and counteract allergy are without proof at present. Histidine may have many other possible functions because it is the precursor of the ubiquitous neurohormone-neurotransmitter histamine. Histidine increases histamine in the blood and probably in the brain. Low blood histamine with low serum histidine occurs in rheumatoid arthritis patients. Low blood histamine also occurs in some manic, schizophrenic, high copper and hyperactive groups of psychiatric patients. Histidine is a useful therapy in all low histamine patients.

91,L-Dopa,"L-Dopa, also known as L-DOPA, levodopa or 3,4-dihdydroxyphenylalanine is an amino acid. It is a naturally occurring form of dihydroxyphenylalanine and the immediate precursor of dopamine. L-DOPA is biosynthesized from tyrosine and is the precursor to the neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and epinephrine (adrenaline). Unlike dopamine itself, L-Dopa crosses the blood-brain barrier. It is rapidly taken up by dopaminergic neurons and converted to dopamine. In particular, it is metabolized to dopamine by aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase. Pyridoxal phosphate (vitamin B6) is a required cofactor for this decarboxylation, and may be administered along with levodopa, usually as pyridoxine. L-Dopa is widely used as a drug and is used for the treatment of Parkinsonian disorders and Dopa-Responsive Dystonia. It is usually given with agents that inhibit its conversion to dopamine outside of the central nervous system. Peripheral tissue conversion may be the mechanism of the adverse effects of levodopa. It is standard clinical practice to co-administer a peripheral DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor - carbidopa or benserazide - and often a catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitor, to prevent synthesis of dopamine in peripheral tissue.↵",HMDB0000181,N[C@@H](CC1=CC(O)=C(O)C=C1)C(O)=O,C9H11NO4,"1S/C9H11NO4/c10-6(9(13)14)3-5-1-2-7(11)8(12)4-5/h1-2,4,6,11-12H,3,10H2,(H,13,14)/t6-/m0/s1",WTDRDQBEARUVNC-LURJTMIESA-N,"(2S)-2-amino-3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid",-1.7921814507627933,9.686049362161093,197.1879,197.068807845,,,,5,4,3,103.77999999999999,49.07810000000001,18.90987044668941,levodopa,0,0,9.055027392905787,1.650696949850563,1,1,1,0,0,0,MDB00000114,"5185,5227,5313,5371"
92,L-Lysine,"L-lysine (Lys) is an essential amino acid. Normal requirements for lysine have been found to be about 8 g per day or 12 mg/kg in adults. Children and infants need more- 44 mg/kg per day for an eleven to-twelve-year old, and 97 mg/kg per day for three-to six-month old. Lysine is highly concentrated in muscle compared to most other amino acids. Lysine is high in foods such as wheat germ, cottage cheese and chicken. Of meat products, wild game and pork have the highest concentration of lysine. Fruits and vegetables contain little lysine, except avocados. Normal lysine metabolism is dependent upon many nutrients including niacin, vitamin B6, riboflavin, vitamin C, glutamic acid and iron. Excess arginine antagonizes lysine. Several inborn errors of lysine metabolism are known. Most are marked by mental retardation with occasional diverse symptoms such as absence of secondary sex characteristics, undescended testes, abnormal facial structure, anemia, obesity, enlarged liver and spleen, and eye muscle imbalance. Lysine also may be a useful adjunct in the treatment of osteoporosis. Although high protein diets result in loss of large amounts of calcium in urine, so does lysine deficiency. Lysine may be an adjunct therapy because it reduces calcium losses in urine. Lysine deficiency also may result in immunodeficiency. Requirements for this amino acid are probably increased by stress. Lysine toxicity has not occurred with oral doses in humans. Lysine dosages are presently too small and may fail to reach the concentrations necessary to prove potential therapeutic applications. Lysine metabolites, amino caproic acid and carnitine have already shown their therapeutic potential. Thirty grams daily of amino caproic acid has been used as an initial daily dose in treating blood clotting disorders, indicating that the proper doses of lysine, its precursor, have yet to be used in medicine. Low lysine levels have been found in patients with Parkinson's, hypothyroidism, kidney disease, asthma and depression. The exact significance of these levels is unclear, yet lysine therapy can normalize the level and has been associated with improvement of some patients with these conditions. Abnormally elevated hydroxylysines have been found in virtually all chronic degenerative diseases and coumadin therapy. The levels of this stress marker may be improved by high doses of vitamin C. Lysine is particularly useful in therapy for marasmus (wasting) and herpes simplex. It stops the growth of herpes simplex in culture, and has helped to reduce the number and occurrence of cold sores in clinical studies. Dosing has not been adequately studied, but beneficial clinical effects occur in doses ranging from 100 mg to 4 g a day. Higher doses may also be useful, and toxicity has not been reported in doses as high as 8 g per day. Diets high in lysine and low in arginine can be useful in the prevention and treatment of herpes. Some researchers think herpes simplex virus is involved in many other diseases related to cranial nerves such as migraines, Bell's palsy and Meniere's disease. Herpes blister fluid will produce fatal encephalitis in the rabbit.

93,Alpha-Lactose,"Alpha-Lactose is the major sugar present in milk and the main source of energy supplied to the newborn mammalian in its mother's milk. Lactose is also an important osmotic regulator of lactation. It is digested by the intestinal lactase (EC 3.2.1.108), an enzyme expressed in newborns. Its activity declines following weaning. As a result, adult mammals are normally lactose-intolerant and more than 75% of the human adult population suffers from lactase deficiency. Lactase deficiency is present in up to 80 percent of blacks and Latinos, and up to 100 percent of American Indians and Asians. Persons with lactose intolerance are unable to digest significant amounts of lactose. Common symptoms include abdominal pain and bloating, excessive flatus, and watery stool following the ingestion of foods containing lactose. A sizable number of adults believe they are lactose intolerant but do not actually have impaired lactose digestion, and some persons with lactase deficiency can tolerate moderate amounts of ingested lactose. A diagnosis of lactose intolerance can usually be made with a careful history supported by dietary manipulation. If necessary, diagnosis can be confirmed by using a breath hydrogen or lactose tolerance test. These mostly uncomfortable symptoms of lactose maldigestion are blamed for a variably dairy consumption. There is, however, emerging evidence that certain lactic acid-producing bacteria, which selectively consume prebiotics, may be beneficial against some lower intestinal diseases. Lactose maldigestion and lactose should perhaps be re-evaluated as a potential provider of such a prebiotic. Treatment consists primarily of avoiding lactose-containing foods. Lactase enzyme supplements may be helpful. The degree of lactose malabsorption varies greatly among patients with lactose intolerance, but most of them can ingest up to 350 mL of milk daily without symptoms. Lactose-intolerant patients must ensure adequate calcium intake.

94,L-Serine,"Serine (Ser) is a nonessential amino acid derived from glycine. Like all the amino acid building blocks of protein and peptides, serine can become essential under certain conditions, and is thus important in maintaining health and preventing disease. Low-average concentration of serine compared to other amino acids is found in muscle. Serine is highly concentrated in all cell membranes. (http://www.dcnutrition.com/AminoAcids/) L-Serine may be derived from four possible sources: dietary intake; biosynthesis from the glycolytic intermediate 3-phosphoglycerate; from glycine ; and by protein and phospholipid degradation. Little data is available on the relative contributions of each of these four sources of l-serine to serine homoeostasis. It is very likely that the predominant source of l-serine will be very different in different tissues and during different stages of human development. In the biosynthetic pathway, the glycolytic intermediate 3-phosphoglycerate is converted into phosphohydroxypyruvate, in a reaction catalyzed by 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (3- PGDH; EC 1.1.1.95). Phosphohydroxypyruvate is metabolized to phosphoserine by phosphohydroxypyruvate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.52) and, finally, phosphoserine is converted into l-serine by phosphoserine phosphatase (PSP; EC 3.1.3.3). In liver tissue, the serine biosynthetic pathway is regulated in response to dietary and hormonal changes. Of the three synthetic enzymes, the properties of 3-PGDH and PSP are the best documented. Hormonal factors such as glucagon and corticosteroids also influence 3-PGDH and PSP activities in interactions dependent upon the diet. L-serine plays a central role in cellular proliferation. L-Serine is the predominant source of one-carbon groups for the de novo synthesis of purine nucleotides and deoxythymidine monophosphate. It has long been recognized that, in cell cultures, L-serine is a conditional essential amino acid, because it cannot be synthesized in sufficient quantities to meet the cellular demands for its utilization. In recent years, L-serine and the products of its metabolism have been recognized not only to be essential for cell proliferation, but also to be necessary for specific functions in the central nervous system. The findings of altered levels of serine and glycine in patients with psychiatric disorders and the severe neurological abnormalities in patients with defects of L-serine synthesis underscore the importance of L-serine in brain development and function.

95,L-Lactic acid,"Lactic acid is an organic acid. It is a chiral molecule, consisting of two optical isomers, L-lactic acid and D-lactic acid, with the L-isomer being the most common in living organisms. Lactic acid plays a role in several biochemical processes and is produced in the muscles during intense activity. In animals, L-lactate is constantly produced from pyruvate via the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in a process of fermentation during normal metabolism and exercise. It does not increase in concentration until the rate of lactate production exceeds the rate of lactate removal. This is governed by a number of factors, including monocarboxylate transporters, lactate concentration, the isoform of LDH, and oxidative capacity of tissues. The concentration of blood lactate is usually 1000-2000 μM at rest, but can rise to over 20000 μM  during intense exertion. There are some indications that lactate, and not glucose, is preferentially metabolized by neurons in the brain of several mammalian species, including mice, rats, and humans. Glial cells, using the lactate shuttle, are responsible for transforming glucose into lactate, and for providing lactate to the neurons. Lactate measurement in critically ill patients has been traditionally used to stratify patients with poor outcomes. However, plasma lactate levels are the result of a finely tuned interplay of factors that affect the balance between its production and its clearance. When the oxygen supply does not match its consumption, organisms adapt in many different ways, up to the point when energy failure occurs. Lactate, being part of the adaptive response, may then be used to assess the severity of the supply/demand imbalance. In such a scenario, the time to intervention becomes relevant: early and effective treatment may allow tissues and cells to revert to a normal state, as long as the oxygen machinery (i.e. mitochondria) is intact. Conversely, once the mitochondria are deranged, energy failure occurs even in the presence of normoxia. The lactate increase in critically ill patients may, therefore, be viewed as an early marker of a potentially reversible state (PMID: 16356243 ). When present in sufficiently high levels, lactic acid can act as an oncometabolite, an immunosuppressant, an acidogen, and a metabotoxin. An oncometabolite is a compound that promotes tumor growth and survival. An immunosuppressant reduces or arrests the activity of the immune system. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of lactic acid are associated with at least a dozen inborn errors of metabolism, including 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyryl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, biotinidase deficiency, fructose-1,6-diphosphatase deficiency, glycogen storage disease type 1A (GSD1A) or Von Gierke disease, glycogenosis type IB, glycogenosis type IC, glycogenosis type VI, Hers disease, lactic acidemia, Leigh syndrome, methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency, pyruvate decarboxylase E1 component deficiency, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency, pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, and short chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (SCAD deficiency). Locally high concentrations of lactic acid or lactate are found near many tumors due to the upregulation of lactate dehydrogenase (PMID: 15279558 ). Lactic acid produced by tumors through aerobic glycolysis acts as an immunosuppressant and tumor promoter (PMID: 23729358 ). Indeed, lactic acid has been found to be a key player or regulator in the development and malignant progression of a variety of cancers (PMID: 22084445 ). A number of studies have demonstrated that malignant transformation is associated with an increase in aerobic cellular lactate excretion. Lactate concentrations in various carcinomas (e.g. uterine cervix, head and neck, colorectal region) at first diagnosis of the disease, can be relatively low or extremely high (up to 40 µmol/g) in different individual tumors or within the same lesion (PMID: 15279558 ). High molar concentrations of lactate are correlated with a high incidence of distant metastasis. Low lactate tumors (< median of approximately 8 µmol/g) are associated with both an overall longer and disease-free survival compared to high lactate lesions (lactate > approximately 8 µmol/g). Lactate-induced secretion of hyaluronan by tumor-associated fibroblasts creates a milieu favorable for cell migration and metastases (PMID: 22084445 ). An acidic environment (pH 6-6.5), which is common in many tumors, allows tumor cells to evade the immune response, and therefore allows them to grow unchecked. Locally high concentrations of lactic acid are known to markedly impede the function of normal immune cells and will lead to a loss of T-cell function of human tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (PMID: 22084445 ). Lactic acid is also an organic acid and acts as a general acidogen. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart abnormalities, kidney abnormalities, liver damage, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of the untreated IEMs mentioned above. Many affected children with organic acidemias experience intellectual disability or delayed development. Lactic acid is also a microbial metabolite, urinary lactic acid is produced by Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Enterobacter, Acinetobacter, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter frundii, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus group B, Staphylococcus saprophyticus (PMID: 22292465 ), Bacillus, Corynebacterium, Rhizopus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (PMID: 26360870).",HMDB0000190,C[C@H](O)C(O)=O,C3H6O3,"1S/C3H6O3/c1-2(4)3(5)6/h2,4H,1H3,(H,5,6)/t2-/m0/s1",JVTAAEKCZFNVCJ-REOHCLBHSA-N,(2S)-2-hydroxypropanoic acid,-0.47182951800000017,14.593508084825753,90.0779,90.031694058,,,,3,2,1,57.53,18.8398,8.05675743839785,(α)-lactate,0,-1,-3.6696493832413326,3.784942414122652,1,0,1,0,0,0,MDB00000118,"5182,5186,5199,5200,5203,5204,5205,5212,5249,5258,5261,5264,5291,5313,5321,5322,5338,5360,5410,5422,5426,5427,5431,5432,5434,5438,5440,5441,5443,5446,5447,5449,5450,5451,5454,5459,5480,5491,5492,5497,5498,5510,5521,5522,5523,5527,5528,5529,5530,5536,5553,5555"
96,L-Aspartic acid,"Aspartic acid (Asp, D), also known as aspartate, the name of its anion, is one of the 20 natural proteinogenic amino acids which are the building blocks of proteins. As its name indicates, aspartic acid is the carboxylic acid analog of asparagine. As a neurotransmitter, aspartic acid may provide resistance to fatigue and thus lead to endurance, although the evidence to support this idea is not strong. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartic_acid) Aspartic acid is a nonessential amino acid which is made from glutamic acid by enzymes using vitamin B6. The amino acid has important roles in the urea cycle and DNA metabolism. Aspartic acid is a major excitatory neurotransmitter, which is sometimes found to be increased in epileptic and stroke patients. It is decreased in depressed patients and in patients with brain atrophy. Aspartic acid supplements are being evaluated. Five grams can raise blood levels. Magnesium and zinc may be natural inhibitors of some of the actions of aspartic acid. Aspartic acid, with the amino acid phenylalanine, is a part of a new natural sweetener, aspartame. This sweetener is an advance in artificial sweeteners, and is probably safe in normal doses to all except phenylketonurics. The jury is still out on the long term effects it has on many brain neurohormones. Aspartic acid may be a significant immunostimulant of the thymus and can protect against some of the damaging effects of radiation. Many claims have been made for the special value of administering aspartic acid in the form of potassium and magnesium salts. Since aspartic acid is relatively nontoxic, studies are now in progress to elucidate its pharmacological and therapeutic roles.

97,L-Cystine,"Cystine (Cys-Cys) is an oxidized dimeric form of cysteine. It is formed by linking two cysteine residues via a disulfide bond (cys-S-S-cys) between the -SH groups. Cystine is found in high concentrations in the cells of the immune system, skeletal and connective tissues, skin, digestive enzymes, and in hair. Hair and skin are 10-14% cystine. Cystine is the preferred form of cysteine for the synthesis of glutathione in cells involved in the immune function including macrophages and astrocytes. Lymphocytes and neurons prefer cysteine for glutathione production. Optimizing glutathione levels in macrophages and astrocytes with cystine allows these cells to provide cysteine to lymphocytes and neurons directly upon demand (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystine).↵",HMDB0000192,N[C@@H](CSSC[C@H](N)C(O)=O)C(O)=O,C6H12N2O4S2,"1S/C6H12N2O4S2/c7-3(5(9)10)1-13-14-2-4(8)6(11)12/h3-4H,1-2,7-8H2,(H,9,10)(H,11,12)/t3-,4-/m0/s1",LEVWYRKDKASIDU-IMJSIDKUSA-N,(2R)-2-amino-3-{[(2R)-2-amino-2-carboxyethyl]disulfanyl}propanoic acid,-5.897687960059564,2.267408279723485,240.3,240.023848262,1.68e+01 g/l,-3.16,-1.16,6,4,7,126.64000000000001,54.87179999999999,22.772305661239265,L-cystine,0,0,9.342140596747571,1.5564231091903382,1,0,1,0,0,0,MDB00000120,"5184,5185,5204,5226,5275,5278,5494,5504,5509,5512"

This dipeptide is normally absent from human tissues and body fluids, and its appearance there is usually an artifact of diet (Proc Soc Pediatr Res 134, 1967).

101,Indoleacetic acid,"Indoleacetic acid (IAA) is a breakdown product of tryptophan metabolism and is often produced by the action of bacteria in the mammalian gut. Some endogenous production of IAA in mammalian tissues also occurs. It may be produced by the decarboxylation of tryptamine or the oxidative deamination of tryptophan. IAA frequently occurs at low levels in urine and has been found in elevated levels in the urine of patients with phenylketonuria ((PMID: 13610897). Using material extracted from human urine, it was discovered by Kogl in 1933 that Indoleacetic acid is also an important plant hormone (PMID: 13610897). Specifically IAA is a member of the group of phytohormones called auxins. IAA is generally considered to be the most important native auxin. Plant cells synthesize IAA from tryptophan. (wikipedia) IAA and some derivatives can be oxidised by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to cytotoxic species. IAA is only toxic after oxidative decarboxylation; the effect of IAA/HRP is thought to be due in part to the formation of methylene-oxindole, which may conjugate with DNA bases and protein thiols. IAA/HRP could be used as the basis for targeted cancer, a potential new role for plant auxins in cancer therapy (PMID: 11163327).↵",HMDB0000197,OC(=O)CC1=CNC2=C1C=CC=C2,C10H9NO2,"1S/C10H9NO2/c12-10(13)5-7-6-11-9-4-2-1-3-8(7)9/h1-4,6,11H,5H2,(H,12,13)",SEOVTRFCIGRIMH-UHFFFAOYSA-N,2-(1H-indol-3-yl)acetic acid,1.709756098333333,16.189363501426207,175.184,175.063328537,1.38e+00 g/l,1.87,-2.10,2,2,2,53.089999999999996,48.4521,17.735695939781067,β-indole-3-acetic acid,0,-1,,4.661850493370194,1,2,1,1,0,0,MDB00000124,"5244,5295,5313,5551"

103,Methylmalonic acid,"Methylmalonic acid is a malonic acid derivative, which is a vital intermediate in the metabolism of fat and protein. In particular, the coenzyme A-linked form of methylmalonic acid, methylmalonyl-CoA, is converted into succinyl-CoA by methylmalonyl-CoA mutase in a reaction that requires vitamin B12 as a cofactor. In this way, methylmalonic acid enters the Krebs cycle and is thus part of one of the anaplerotic reactions. Methylmalonic acid has been linked to Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) deficiency. In adults (>18 years old) with cobalamin deficiency, blood concentration of methylmalonic acid is significantly elevated at a concentration of 22.0 (4.3-37.0) μM compared to normal adults at a concentration of 0.14 (0.04-0.26) μM (PMID: 8412012). Abnormalities in methylmalonic acid metabolism lead to methylmalonic aciduria. This inborn error of metabolism is attributed to a block in the enzymatic conversion of methylmalonyl CoA to succinyl CoA. In infants (0-1 years) with methylmalonic aciduria, the blood concentration of methylmalonic acid is elevated at a concentration of 52.5 (5.0-100.0) μM compared to normal infants at a concentration of <0.27 μM (PMID: 28070528). Methylmalonic acid is also found to be associated with other inborn errors of metabolism, including cobalamin deficiency, cobalamin malabsorption, malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency, and transcobalamin II deficiency. When present in sufficiently high levels, methylmalonic acid can act as an acidogen and a metabotoxin. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of methylmalonic acid are associated with at least 5 inborn errors of metabolism, including Malonyl CoA decarboxylase deficiency, Malonic Aciduria, Methylmalonate Semialdehyde Dehydrogenase Deficiency, Methylmalonic Aciduria and Methylmalonic Aciduria Due to Cobalamin-Related Disorders. Methylmalonic acid is an organic acid and abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. In adolescents (13-18 years old) with malonyl CoA decarboxylase deficiency, blood concentration of methylmalonic acid is significantly elevated at a concentration of 2.8 uM compared to normal adolescents at a concentration of 0.15-0.55 uM (PMID: 24613099). This shift in concentration in those with Malonyl CoA decarboxylase deficiency prevents the body from converting certain fats to energy. The signs and symptoms of this disorder typically appear in early childhood and almost all affected children have delayed development. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart abnormalities, kidney abnormalities, liver damage, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of the untreated IEMs mentioned above.

104,Phenylpyruvic acid,"Phenylpyruvic acid is a keto-acid that is an intermediate or catabolic byproduct of phenylalanine metabolism. It has a slight honey-like odor. Levels of phenylpyruvate are normally very low in blood or urine. High levels of phenylpyruvic acid can be found in the urine of individuals with phenylketonuria (PKU), an inborn error of metabolism. PKU is due to lack of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), so that phenylalanine is converted not to tyrosine but to phenylpyruvic acid. In particular, excessive phenylalanine can be metabolized into phenylketones through a transaminase pathway route involving glutamate. Metabolites of this transamination reaction include phenylacetate, phenylpyruvate and phenethylamine. In persons with PKU, dietary phenylalanine either accumulates in the body or some of it is converted to phenylpyruvic acid. Individuals with PKU tend to excrete large quantities of phenylpyruvate, phenylacetate and phenyllactate, along with phenylalanine, in their urine and this is seen across newborns, infants, children as well as adults. In newborns (0-30 days old) with PKU, phenylpyruvic acid is significantly elevated in the urine at a concentration of 146.6 +/- 244.6 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 2091926 ) compared to the normal concentration of 0.00064 +/- 0.000544 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 7320149). In infants (0-1 year old) with PKU, phenylpyruvic acid is significantly elevated in the urine at a concentration of 7796.386 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 15168722) compared to the normal concentration of 0.207 +/- 0.275 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID:4837567). In children (1-13 years old) with PKU, phenylpyruvic acid is significantly elevated in the urine at a concentration of 882.948 +/- 741.0699 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 4837567) compared to the normal concentration of <2 umol/mmol creatinine (BC Children’s Hospital Biochemical Genetics Lab). In adults (>18 years old) with PKU, phenylpyruvic acid is significantly elevated in the blood at a concentration of 1.4 +/- 0.2 μM (PMID: 8216688) compared to the normal concentration of 0.5 +/- 0.1 μM (PMID: 8216688). If untreated, mental retardation effects and microcephaly are evident by the first year along with other symptoms which include: unusual irritability, epileptic seizures and skin lesions. Hyperactivity, EEG abnormalities and seizures, and severe learning disabilities are major clinical problems later in life. A ""musty or mousy"" odor of skin, hair, sweat and urine (due to phenylacetate accumulation); and a tendency to hypopigmentation and eczema are also observed. The neural-development effects of PKU are primarily due to the disruption of neurotransmitter synthesis. In particular, phenylalanine is a large, neutral amino acid which moves across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) via the large neutral amino acid transporter (LNAAT). Excessive phenylalanine in the blood saturates the transporter. Thus, excessive levels of phenylalanine significantly decrease the levels of other LNAAs in the brain. But since these amino acids are required for protein and neurotransmitter synthesis, phenylalanine accumulation disrupts brain development, leading to mental retardation. Phenylpyruvic acid is also a microbial metabolite, it can be produced by Lactobacillus plantarum (PMID: 9687465 ).",HMDB0000205,OC(=O)C(=O)CC1=CC=CC=C1,C9H8O3,"1S/C9H8O3/c10-8(9(11)12)6-7-4-2-1-3-5-7/h1-5H,6H2,(H,11,12)",BTNMPGBKDVTSJY-UHFFFAOYSA-N,2-oxo-3-phenylpropanoic acid,1.9002137729999997,16.097510920786018,164.158,164.047344122,,,,3,1,3,54.37,42.711600000000004,15.750874725076514,phenylpyruvic acid,0,-1,-9.757724229361303,3.332859227478436,1,1,1,1,0,0,MDB00000127,"5177,5178,5324"
105,Oxoglutaric acid,"Oxoglutaric acid, also known as alpha-ketoglutarate, alpha-ketoglutaric acid, AKG, or 2-oxoglutaric acid, is classified as a gamma-keto acid or a gamma-keto acid derivative. gamma-Keto acids are organic compounds containing an aldehyde substituted with a keto group on the C4 carbon atom. alpha-Ketoglutarate is considered to be soluble (in water) and acidic. alpha-Ketoglutarate is a key molecule in the TCA cycle, playing a fundamental role in determining the overall rate of this important metabolic process (PMID: 26759695 ). In the TCA cycle, AKG is decarboxylated to succinyl-CoA and carbon dioxide by AKG dehydrogenase, which functions as a key control point of the TCA cycle. Additionally, AKG can be generated from isocitrate by oxidative decarboxylation catalyzed by the enzyme known as isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH). In addition to these routes of production, AKG can be produced from glutamate by oxidative deamination via glutamate dehydrogenase, and as a product of pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transamination reactions (mediated by branched-chain amino acid transaminases) in which glutamate is a common amino donor. AKG is a nitrogen scavenger and a source of glutamate and glutamine that stimulates protein synthesis and inhibits protein degradation in muscles. In particular, AKG can decrease protein catabolism and increase protein synthesis to enhance bone tissue formation in skeletal muscles (PMID: 26759695 ). Interestingly, enteric feeding of AKG supplements can significantly increase circulating plasma levels of hormones such as insulin, growth hormone, and insulin-like growth factor-1 (PMID: 26759695 ). It has recently been shown that AKG can extend the lifespan of adult C. elegans by inhibiting ATP synthase and TOR (PMID: 24828042 ). In combination with molecular oxygen, alpha-ketoglutarate is required for the hydroxylation of proline to hydroxyproline in the production of type I collagen. A recent study has shown that alpha-ketoglutarate promotes TH1 differentiation along with the depletion of glutamine thereby favouring Treg (regulatory T-cell) differentiation (PMID: 26420908 ). alpha-Ketoglutarate has been found to be associated with fumarase deficiency, 2-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex deficiency, and D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria, which are all inborn errors of metabolism (PMID: 8338207 ).",HMDB0000208,OC(=O)CCC(=O)C(O)=O,C5H6O5,"1S/C5H6O5/c6-3(5(9)10)1-2-4(7)8/h1-2H2,(H,7,8)(H,9,10)",KPGXRSRHYNQIFN-UHFFFAOYSA-N,2-oxopentanedioic acid,-0.1092632996666667,3.866108156790311,146.0981,146.021523302,5.31e+01 g/l,-0.60,-0.44,5,2,4,91.66999999999999,28.883000000000003,12.166536450524555,oxoglutarate,0,-2,-9.667717541536742,2.663960637840809,1,0,1,0,0,0,MDB00000130,"5173,5313,5339,5343,5376,5432,5445,5446,5447,5492,5497,5521"
106,Phenylacetic acid,"Phenyl acetate (or phenylacetate) is a carboxylic acid ester that has been found in the biofluids of patients with nephritis and/or hepatitis as well as patients with phenylketonuria (PKU), an inborn error of metabolism. Phenyl acetate has been identified as a uremic toxin according to the European Uremic Toxin Working Group (PMID: 22626821 ). Excess phenylalanine in the body can be disposed of through a transamination process leading to the production of phenylpyruvate. The phenylpyruvate can be further metabolized into a number of products. Decarboxylation of phenylpyruvate gives phenylacetate, while a reduction reaction gives phenyllactate. The phenylacetate can be further conjugated with glutamine to give phenylacetyl glutamine. All of these metabolites can be detected in serum and urine of PKU patients. Phenylacetate is shown to be significantly elevated in the urine of infants (0-1 year old) with PKU at a concentration of 55.6 +/- 87.3 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 2091926) compared to normal infants at a concentration of 0.000000079 (0-0.00000095) μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 4837567). Phenyl acetate is also produced endogenously as the metabolite of 2-Phenylethylamine, which is mainly metabolized by monoamine oxidase to form phenyl acetate. 2-phenylethylamine is an ""endogenous amphetamine"" which may modulate central adrenergic functions, and the urinary phenyl acetate levels have been postulated as a marker for depression. (PMID: 17978765 , 476920 , 6857245 ). Phenylacetate is also found in essential oils, e.g. neroli, rose oil, free and as esters' and in many fruits. As a result it is used as a perfumery and flavoring ingredient. Phenyl acetate is a microbial metabolite. Phenyl acetate has been associated with kidney disease, specifically end-stage renal failure where blood phenylacetate levels in adults >18 years old are shown to be elevated at a concentration of 3490.0 +/- 330.0 μM (PMID: 12865413) compared to normal adults at a concentration <10.28 μM (PMID: 22626821). Blood phenylacetate has also shown to be significantly elevated in adults >18 years with uremia at a concentration of 3485.92 +/- 329.79 μM compared to normal individuals at a concentration <10.28 μM (PMID: 22626821).

108,Myoinositol,"Myoinositol is a cyclic polyalcohol and a carbocyclic sugar. Besides myo-inositol, the other naturally occurring stereoisomers of inositiol are scyllo-, muco-, D-chiro-, and neo-inositol, although they occur in minimal quantities in nature. Myoinositol is abundant in brain and other mammalian tissues and mediates cell signal transduction in response to a variety of hormones, neurotransmitters and growth factors and participates in osmoregulation. It is aalso classified as sugar alcohol with half the sweetness of sucrose (table sugar). It is made naturally in humans from glucose. A human kidney makes about two grams per day. The highest concentration of myoinositol is in the brain where it plays an important role making other neurotransmitters and some steroid hormones bind to their receptors. Myoinositol plays an important role as a second messenger in a cell, in the form of inositol phosphates. Inositol phospholipids are important in signal transduction. Myoinositol is found in many foods, particularly in cantaloupe and oranges. In plants, the hexaphosphate of inositol, phytic acid serves as phosphate stores in seed, for example in nuts and beans. Phytic acid also occurs in cereals with high bran content.. Myoinositol is an isomer of glucose that has traditionally been considered to be a B vitamin although it has an uncertain status as a vitamin and a deficiency syndrome has not been identified in man. Myo-inositol gained importance in the management of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) due to its efficacy, safety profile and worldwide availability.",HMDB0000211,O[C@H]1[C@H](O)[C@@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@@H]1O,C6H12O6,"1S/C6H12O6/c7-1-2(8)4(10)6(12)5(11)3(1)9/h1-12H/t1-,2-,3-,4+,5-,6-",CDAISMWEOUEBRE-GPIVLXJGSA-N,"(1R,2R,3r,4S,5S,6s)-cyclohexane-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexol",-3.782009652,12.908097249605351,180.1559,180.063388116,4.85e+02 g/l,-2.59,0.43,6,6,0,121.38000000000001,35.77499999999999,16.141745963720343,L-inositol,0,0,-3.645759838065448,12.285497953856298,1,1,0,0,0,0,MDB00000133,"5244,5313,5396"
109,Ornithine,"Ornithine or L-ornithine, also known as (S)-2,5-diaminopentanoic acid is a member of the class of compounds known as L-alpha-amino acids. L-alpha-amino acids are alpha amino acids which have the L-configuration of the alpha-carbon atom. L-ornithine is soluble (in water) and a moderately basic compound. Ornithine is a non-proteinogenic amino acid that plays a role in the urea cycle. It is considered to be a non-essential amino acid. A non-essential amino acid is an amino acid that can be synthesized from central metabolic pathway intermediates in humans and is not required in the diet. L-Ornithine is one of the products of the action of the enzyme arginase on L-arginine, creating urea. Therefore, ornithine is a central part of the urea cycle, which allows for the disposal of excess nitrogen. Outside the human body, L-ornithine is abundant in a number of food items such as wild rice, brazil nuts, common oregano, and common grapes. L-ornithine can be found throughout most human tissues; and in most biofluids, some of which include blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), sweat, saliva, and feces. L-ornithine exists in all living species, from bacteria to plants to humans. L-Ornithine is also a precursor of citrulline and arginine. In order for ornithine that is produced in the cytosol to be converted to citrulline, it must first cross the inner mitochondrial membrane into the mitochondrial matrix where it is carbamylated by the enzyme known as ornithine transcarbamylase. This transfer is mediated by the mitochondrial ornithine transporter (SLC25A15; AF112968; ORNT1). Mutations in the mitochondrial ornithine transporter result in hyperammonemia, hyperornithinemia, homocitrullinuria (HHH) syndrome, a disorder of the urea cycle (PMID: 16256388 ). The pathophysiology of the disease may involve diminished ornithine transport into mitochondria, resulting in ornithine accumulation in the cytoplasm and reduced ability to clear carbamoyl phosphate and ammonia loads (OMIM 838970 ). In humans, L-ornithine is involved in a number of other metabolic disorders, some of which include, ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTC deficiency) (PMID: 16635166), argininemia, and guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency (GAMT deficiency). Ornithine is abnormally reduced in the body in ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency. Specifically, in adults (>18 years old) with OTC deficiency, ornithine is reduced in the blood at a concentration of 41.0 +/- 16.0 μM (PMID: 16635166) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 109.0 +/- 32.0 μM (PMID: 16635166). Moreover, ornithine is found to be associated with cystinuria (PMID: 14586528), hyperdibasic aminoaciduria I (PMID: 5727921), and lysinuric protein intolerance (PMID: 27506743), which are inborn errors of metabolism. In adults (>18 years old) with cystinuria, ornithine is found to be significantly elevated in the urine at a concentration of 19-988.300 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 14586528) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 1.5-2.6 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 27012787). In adults (>18 years old) with hyperdibasic aminoaciduria I, ornithine is elevated in the urine at a concentration of 4.106-13.859 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 5727921) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 1.882 +/- 1.968 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 5727921). In adults (>18 years old) with lysinuric intolerance, ornithine is elevated in the blood at a concentration of 32.3 (22.4-53.9) μM (PMID: 27506743) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 74.3 (52.7-81.3) μM (PMID: 27506743).

110,Norepinephrine,"Norepinephrine is the precursor of epinephrine that is secreted by the adrenal medulla and is a widespread central and autonomic neurotransmitter. Norepinephrine is the principal transmitter of most postganglionic sympathetic fibers and of the diffuse projection system in the brain arising from the locus ceruleus. It is also found in plants and is used pharmacologically as a sympathomimetic. Norepinephrine is elevated in the urine of people who consume bananas. Norepinephrine is also a microbial metabolite; urinary noradrenaline is produced by Escherichia, Bacillus, and Saccharomyces (PMID: 24621061). Norepinephrine release is lowest during sleep, rises during wakefulness, and reaches much higher levels during situations of stress or danger, in the so-called fight-or-flight response.Norepinephrine is widely used as an injectable drug for the treatment of critically low blood pressure. It is classified as a sympathomimetic drug as it leads to increasing heart rate and force and constricting blood vessels.Norepinephrine is found in alcoholic beverages, banana peels and pulp (Musa paradisiaca), red plum fruit (Prunus domestica), orange pulp (Citrus sinensis), potato tubers (Solanum tuberosum), and whole purslane (Portulaca oleracea). P. oleracea is the richest of these sources. Norepinephrine has also been identified as a uremic toxin according to the European Uremic Toxin Working Group (PMID: 22626821). In adult (>18 years old) with uremia, blood levels of norepinephrine are significantly elevated at a concentration of 0.012 +/- 0.005 μM (PMID: 22626821) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 0.001 +/- 0.0004 μM (PMID: 22626821). Norepinephrine has also been identified as a biomarker for subarachnoid hemorrhage where blood concentrations of norepinephrine is significantly elevated in adults >18 years old at 0.0037 +/- 0.00048 μM (PMID: 12121816) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 0.0016 +/- 0.00012 μM (PMID: 12121816). Norepinephrine levels have also been associated with heat stress and its effects on working memory, choice reaction time and mood state (PMID: 16309771).

114,Oxoadipic acid,"2-Oxoadipic acid belongs to the class of organic compounds known as medium-chain keto acids and derivatives produced from lysine in the cytosol of cells via the saccharopine and the pipecolic acid pathways. Catabolites of hydroxylysine and tryptophan enter these pathways as 2-aminoadipic- -semialdehyde and 2-oxoadipate, respectively. In the matrix of mitochondria, 2-oxoadipate is decarboxylated to glutaryl-CoA by the 2-oxoadipate dehydrogenase complex and then converted to acetyl-CoA. 2-Oxoadipic aciduria is an in-born error of metabolism of lysine, tryptophan, and hydroxylysine, in which abnormal quantities of 2-aminoadipic acid are found in body fluids along with 2-oxoadipic acid. Patients with 2-Oxoadipic acidemias are intellectually disabled with hypotonia or seizures. 2-Oxoadipic aciduria can occur in patients with Kearns-Sayre Syndrome, a progressive disorder with onset prior to 20 years of age in which multiple organ systems are affected, including progressive external ophthalmoplegia, retinopathy, and the age of onset, and these are associated classically with abnormalities in cardiac conduction, cerebellar signs, and elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein (PMID: 10655159 , 16183823 , 11083877 ). Oxoadipic acid is found to be associated with alpha-aminoadipic aciduria, which is an inborn error of metabolism where the disease condition is found in children aged 2-17 years old having a concentration of 70.0 (20.0-120.0) umol/mmol creatinine compared to normal condition children in the same age group having concentration of 1.2 (101.2-) umol/mmol creatinine",HMDB0000225,OC(=O)CCCC(=O)C(O)=O,C6H8O5,"1S/C6H8O5/c7-4(6(10)11)2-1-3-5(8)9/h1-3H2,(H,8,9)(H,10,11)",FGSBNBBHOZHUBO-UHFFFAOYSA-N,2-oxohexanedioic acid,0.33530536533333316,4.035296902862189,160.1247,160.037173366,2.34e+01 g/l,-0.37,-0.83,5,2,5,91.66999999999999,33.484,14.159721281418744,oxoadipate,0,-2,-9.657072598097674,2.842680623658864,1,0,1,0,0,0,MDB00000143,"5368,5470"
115,Orotic acid,"Orotic acid is classified as a pyrimidinemonocarboxylic acid. That is it is a uracil bearing a carboxy substituent at position C-6. It is also classified as a pyrimidinedione and a carboxylic acid. Orotic acid is a minor dietary constituent. Indeed, until it was realized that it could be synthesized by humans, orotic acid was known as vitamin B-13. The richest dietary sources of orotic acid are cow's milk and other dairy products as well as root vegetables such as carrots and beets. Dietary intake probably contributes to a basal rate of orotic acid excretion in urine because fasting decreases excretion by ~50%. However, it is now apparent that most urinary orotic acid is synthesized in the body, where it arises as an intermediate in the pathway for the synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides. Orotic acid is converted to UMP by UMP synthase, a multifunctional protein with both orotate phosphoribosyltransferase and orotidylate decarboxylase activity. The most frequently observed inborn error of pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis is a mutation of the multifunctional protein UMP synthase (UMP synthase deficiency or orotic aciduria). This disorder prevents the conversion of orotic acid to UMP, and thus to other pyrimidines. As a result, plasma orotic acid accumulates to high concentrations, and increased quantities appear in the urine. Indeed, urinary orotic acid is so markedly increased in individuals harboring a mutation in UMP synthase that orotic acid crystals can form in the urine. The urinary concentration of orotic acid in individuals suffering from orotic aciduria can be of the order of millimoles of orotic acid per millimole creatinine. By comparison, the urinary level in unaffected individuals is ~ 1 ¬¨umol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 17513443). Orotic aciduria is characterized by megaloblastic anemia and orotic acid crystalluria that is frequently associated with some degree of physical and mental retardation. These features respond to appropriate pyrimidine replacement therapy and most cases appear to have a good prognosis. When present in sufficiently high levels, orotic acid can act as an acidogen and a metabotoxin. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of orotic acid are associated with at least seven inborn errors of metabolism, including argininemia, LPI syndrome (lysinuric protein intolerance), hyperornithinemia-hyperammonemia-homocitrullinuria (HHH), OTC deficiency, citrullinemia type I, purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency, and orotic aciduria. In children (1-13 years old) with OTC deficiency, urine levels of orotic acid is found to be significantly elevated at a concentration of 2-2800 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 3202644) compared to normal children at a concentration of 0.23 +/- 0.13 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 16139832). Orotic acid is broadly classified as an organic acid. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. In adults (>18 years old) with orotic aciduria, urine orotic acid levels are significantly elevated at a concentration of 8.24 μmol/mmol creatinine creatinine (PMID: 25757096) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 1.05 +/- 1.22 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 7449082). Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart abnormalities, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of the untreated IEMs mentioned above. Many affected children with organic acidemias experience intellectual disability or delayed development. In adults, acidosis or acidemia is characterized by headaches, confusion, feeling tired, tremors, sleepiness, and seizures.",HMDB0000226,OC(=O)C1=CC(=O)NC(=O)N1,C5H4N2O4,"1S/C5H4N2O4/c8-3-1-2(4(9)10)6-5(11)7-3/h1H,(H,9,10)(H2,6,7,8,11)",PXQPEWDEAKTCGB-UHFFFAOYSA-N,"2,6-dioxo-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyrimidine-4-carboxylic acid",-1.227664501,8.781577888084735,156.0963,156.017106626,4.51e+00 g/l,-0.89,-1.54,4,3,1,95.5,33.27460000000001,12.461507679606417,orotic acid,0,-1,-6.031557162374663,2.827266331449678,1,1,1,0,0,0,MDB00000144,5339
116,Mevalonic acid,"Mevalonic acid (MVA) is a dihydroxy acid. It is a key organic compound in biochemistry. It is a precursor in the biosynthetic pathway, known as the HMG-CoA reductase pathway (also known as the mevalonate pathway) that produces terpenes and steroids. Mevalonate is produced by NADPH from 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA via reduction. This reaction occurs in the cytosol. It is the first committed step in cholesterol synthesis. The production of mevalonic acid (MVA) by the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, is the rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of cholesterol (Jemal et. al, Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry, 2003, 17:1715). Plasma concentrations and urinary excretion of MVA are decreased by HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor drugs such as pravastatin, simvastatin and atorvastatin (Naoumova RP, Marais AD, Mountney J, Firth JC, Rendell NB, Taylor GW, Thompson GR.

117,Phenol,"Phenol, is a toxic, colourless crystalline solid with a sweet tarry odor that resembles a hospital smell. It is commonly used as an antiseptic and disinfectant. It is active against a wide range of micro-organisms including some fungi and viruses, but is only slowly effective against spores. It has been used to disinfect skin and to relieve itching. Phenol is also used in the preparation of cosmetics including sunscreens, hair dyes, and skin lightening preparations. It is also used in the production of drugs (it is the starting material in the industrial production of aspirin), weedkillers, and synthetic resins. Phenol can be found in areas with high levels of motor traffic, therefore, people living in crowded urban areas are frequently exposed to traffic-derived phenol vapor. The average (mean +/- SD) phenol concentration in urine among normal individuals living in urban areas is 7.4 +/- 2.2 mg/g of creatinine. Exposure of the skin to concentrated phenol solutions causes chemical burns which may be severe; in laboratories where it is used, it is usually recommended that polyethylene glycol solution is kept available for washing off splashes. Notwithstanding the effects of concentrated solutions, it is also used in cosmetic surgery as an exfoliant, to remove layers of dead skin (Wikipedia). In some bacteria phenol can be directly synthesized from tyrosine via the enzyme tyrosine phenol-lyase [EC:4.1.99.2].↵",HMDB0000228,OC1=CC=CC=C1,C6H6O,"1S/C6H6O/c7-6-4-2-1-3-5-6/h1-5,7H",ISWSIDIOOBJBQZ-UHFFFAOYSA-N,phenol,1.6696804943333332,,94.1112,94.041864814,4.66e+01 g/l,1.39,-0.31,1,1,0,20.23,28.038899999999998,9.812560861971921,phenol,0,0,-5.476712177992348,10.016150276173818,1,1,1,0,1,0,MDB00000146,"5244,5313"
118,Nicotinamide ribotide,"Nicotinamide ribotide (NMN) is an important intermediate metabolite in the nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism pathway. Mammals predominantly use nicotinamide rather than nicotinic acid as a precursor for NAD biosynthesis. Instead of the deamidation to nicotinic acid, nicotinamide is directly converted to NMN by nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT, EC 2.4.2.12). The enzyme nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMNAT, EC 2.7.7.1), a member of the nucleotidyltransferase alpha/beta-phosphodiesterase superfamily, catalyzes the reaction NMN + ATP = Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) + PPi, representing the final step in the biosynthesis of NAD, a molecule playing a fundamental role as a cofactor in cellular redox reactions. Thus NMN is an important metabolite for the maintenance of normal NAD biosynthesis, and circulating NMN levels may play an important role in regulating cell function in physiological and pathophysiological conditions (PMID: 15078171, 17983582).↵",HMDB0000229,NC(=O)C1=CC=C[N+](=C1)[C@@H]1O[C@H](COP(O)([O-])=O)[C@@H](O)[C@H]1O,C11H15N2O8P,"1S/C11H15N2O8P/c12-10(16)6-2-1-3-13(4-6)11-9(15)8(14)7(21-11)5-20-22(17,18)19/h1-4,7-9,11,14-15H,5H2,(H3-,12,16,17,18,19)/t7-,8-,9-,11-/m1/s1",DAYLJWODMCOQEW-TURQNECASA-N,"3-carbamoyl-1-[(2R,3R,4S,5R)-3,4-dihydroxy-5-[(phosphonooxy)methyl]oxolan-2-yl]-1lambda5-pyridin-1-ylium",-6.244347915138411,6.238873946004625,334.2192,334.056601978,1.80e+00 g/l,-1.50,-2.31,7,5,5,163.41999999999996,71.70739999999999,29.046815469947326,"3-carbamoyl-1-[(2R,3R,4S,5R)-3,4-dihydroxy-5-[(phosphonooxy)methyl]oxolan-2-yl]-1lambda5-pyridin-1-ylium",1,-1,-1.6275786986158498,1.2136795738389177,1,2,1,0,0,0,MDB00000147,
119,Quinolinic acid,"Quinolinic acid, also known as quinolinate, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as pyridinecarboxylic acids. Pyridinecarboxylic acids are compounds containing a pyridine ring bearing a carboxylic acid group. It is also classified as a pyridine-2,3-dicarboxylic acid, which is a dicarboxylic acid with a pyridine backbone. Quinolinic acid is a colourless solid. In plants, it is the biosynthetic precursor to nicotine. Quinolinic acid is found in all organisms, from microbes to plants to animals. Quinolinic acid can be biosynthesized via aspartic acid in plants. Oxidation of aspartate by the enzyme aspartate oxidase gives iminosuccinate, containing the two carboxylic acid groups that are found in quinolinic acid. Condensation of iminosuccinate with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, mediated by quinolinate synthase, affords quinolinic acid. Quinolinic acid is also a downstream product of the kynurenine pathway, which metabolises the amino acid tryptophan ((PMID: 22678511). The kynurenine/tryptophan degradation pathway is important for its production of the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and produces several neuroactive intermediates including quinolinic acid, kynurenine (KYN), kynurenic acid (KYNA), 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK), and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HANA). In animals quinolinic acid acts as an NMDA receptor agonist and has a possible role in neurodegenerative disorders (PMID: 22678511). It also acts as a neurotoxin, gliotoxin, proinflammatory mediator, and pro-oxidant molecule (PMID: 22248144). Quinolinic acid can act as an endogenous brain excitotoxin when released by activated macrophages (PMID: 15013955). Within the brain, quinolinic acid is only produced by activated microglia and macrophages. Quinolinic acid is unable to pass through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and must be produced within the brain by microglial cells or macrophages that have passed the BBB (PMID: 22248144 ). While quinolinic acid cannot pass through the BBB, kynurenic acid, tryptophan and 3-hydroxykynurenine can and can subsequently act as precursors to the production of quinolinic acid in the brain (PMID: 22248144). Quinolinic acid has potent neurotoxic effects. Studies have demonstrated that quinolinic acid may be involved in many psychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases in the brain including ALS, Alzheimer’s disease, brain ischemia, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease and AIDS-dementia. Elevated CSF levels of quinolinic acid are correlated with the severity of neuropsychological deficits in patients who have AIDS. Indeed, levels of quinolinic acid in the CSF of AIDS patients suffering from AIDS-dementia can be up to twenty times higher than normal (PMID: 10936623). Specifically, quinolinic acid is significantly elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid of adults (>18 years old) at a concentration of 3.78 +/- 0.88 μM (PMID: 9657528) compared to normal individuals at a concentration of 0.022 +/- 0.0021 μM (PMID: 9657528). Quinolinic acid levels are increased in the brains of children infected with a range of bacterial infections of the central nervous system (CNS), of poliovirus patients, and of Lyme disease with CNS involvement. In addition, raised quinolinic acid levels have been found in traμMatic CNS injury patients, patients suffering from cognitive decline with ageing, hyperammonemia patients, hypoglycaemia patients, and systemic lupus erythematosus patients. Quinolinic acid has also been detected, but not quantified in, several different foods, such as Ceylon cinnamons, pitanga, Oregon yampahs, red bell peppers, and durians. This could make quinolinic acid a potential biomarker for the consμMption of these foods. Quinolinic acid has also shown to be associated with uremia where adults (>18 years old) with uremia have shown to have elevated levels of blood quinolinic acid at a concentration of 8.982 +/- 5.389 μM (PMID: 12675874) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 0.599 +/- 0.299 μM (PMID: 12675874). Additionally, in adults (>18 years old) with fatal hepatic coma, quinolinic acid was shown to be significantly reduced in the cerebrospinal fluid at a concentration of 0.00015 (0.00011-0.00019) μM (PMID: 2430055) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 0.018 (0.012-0.024) μM (PMID: 15206793).",HMDB0000232,OC(=O)C1=CC=CN=C1C(O)=O,C7H5NO4,"1S/C7H5NO4/c9-6(10)4-2-1-3-8-5(4)7(11)12/h1-3H,(H,9,10)(H,11,12)",GJAWHXHKYYXBSV-UHFFFAOYSA-N,"pyridine-2,3-dicarboxylic acid",-1.0261279053302073,4.095867548424451,167.1189,167.021857653,4.07e+00 g/l,0.15,-1.61,5,2,2,87.49000000000001,38.0415,14.34239790996518,quinolinic acid,0,-2,5.743217331848265,0.30900716364465675,1,1,1,0,0,0,MDB00000149,"5189,5244,5245,5329,5335,5367,5374,5517"
120,Testosterone,"Testosterone is the primary male sex hormone and anabolic steroid from the androstane class of steroids. It is the most important androgen in potency and quantity for vertebrates. In humans, testosterone plays a key role in the development of male reproductive tissues such as testes and prostate, as well as promoting secondary sexual characteristics such as increased muscle and bone mass, and the growth of body hair. In addition, testosterone is involved in health and well-being, and the prevention of osteoporosis. Testosterone exerts its action through binding to and activation of the androgen receptor. In mammals, testosterone is metabolized mainly in the liver. Approximately 50% of testosterone is metabolized via conjugation into testosterone glucuronide and to a lesser extent testosterone sulfate by glucuronosyltransferases and sulfotransferases. An additional 40% of testosterone is metabolized in equal proportions into the 17-ketosteroids androsterone and etiocholanolone via the combined actions of 5alpha- and 5beta-reductases, 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and 17beta-HSD. Like other steroid hormones, testosterone is derived from cholesterol. The first step in the biosynthesis of testosterone involves the oxidative cleavage of the side-chain of cholesterol by the cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc, CYP11A1) to give pregnenolone. In the next step, two additional carbon atoms are removed by the CYP17A1 (17alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase) enzyme to yield a variety of C19 steroids. In addition, the 3beta-hydroxyl group is oxidized by 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase to produce androstenedione. In the final and rate limiting step, the C17 keto group androstenedione is reduced by 17beta-hydroxysteroid hydrogenase to yield testosterone. Testosterone is synthesized and released by the Leydig cells in the testes that lie between the tubules and comprise less than 5% of the total testicular volume. Testosterone diffuses into the seminiferous tubules where it is essential for maintaining spermatogenesis. Some testosterone binds to an androgen-binding protein (ABP) that is produced by the Sertoli cells and is homologous to the sex-hormone binding globulin that transports testosterone in the general circulation. The ABP carries testosterone in the testicular fluid where it maintains the activity of the accessory sex glands and may also help to retain testosterone within the tubule and bind excess free hormone. Some testosterone is converted to estradiol by Sertoli cell-derived aromatase enzyme. Leydig cell steroidogenesis is controlled primarily by luteinizing hormone with negative feedback of testosterone on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. The requirement of spermatogenesis for high local concentrations of testosterone means that loss of androgen production is likely to be accompanied by loss of spermatogenesis. Indeed, if testicular androgen production is inhibited by the administration of exogenous androgens then spermatogenesis ceases. This is the basis of using exogenous testosterone as a male contraceptive. The largest amounts of testosterone (>95%) are produced by the testes in men, while the adrenal glands account for most of the remainder. Testosterone is also synthesized in far smaller total quantities in women by the adrenal glands, thecal cells of the ovaries, and, during pregnancy, by the placenta. Testosterone levels fall by about 1% each year in men. Therefore, with increasing longevity and the aging of the population, the number of older men with testosterone deficiency will increase substantially over the next several decades. Serum testosterone levels decrease progressively in aging men, but the rate and magnitude of decrease vary considerably. Approximately 1% of healthy young men have total serum testosterone levels below normal; in contrast, approximately 20% of healthy men over age 60 years have serum testosterone levels below normal. (PMID: 17904450 , 17875487). In addition to its role as a natural hormone, testosterone is used as a medication in the treatment of low testosterone levels in men, transgender hormone therapy for transgender men, and breast cancer in women. In individuals with hypogonadism, a reduced production of blood testosterone is seen in adolescents (13-18 years old) at a concentration of 0.010 +/- 0.013 μM (PMID: 28266512) compared to normal adolescents at a concentration of 0.00125-0.0276 μM. Testosterone has also been linked to 21 Hydroxylase Deficiency and 11 Beta Hydroxylase Deficiency. In adults (>18 years old) with 21 Hydroxylase Deficiency, blood concentration of testosterone is shown to be elevated at a concentration of 0.00198-0.00368 μM (PMID: 11826238)compared to normal adults at a concentration of 0.00139 +/- 0.000763 μM (PMID: 11826238). Similarly, in children (1-13 years old) with 11 Beta Hydroxylase Deficiency, blood concentration of testosterone is shown to be elevated at a concentration of 0.00150-0.00420 μM (PMID: 8933406) compared to normal children at a concentration <0.000400 μM (PMID: 8933406). Testosterone has also been linked with X-Linked ichthyosis, a skin condition caused by the hereditary deficiency of the steroid sulfatase (STS) enzyme that affects 1 in 2000 to 1 in 6000 males. In adults (>18 years old) with X-Linked ichthyosis, testosterone is shown to be elevated in the blood at a concentration of 0.00900-0.0360 μM (PMID: 3864567) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 0.0094 (0-0.023) μM (PMID: 16477341).",HMDB0000234,[H][C@@]12CC[C@H](O)[C@@]1(C)CC[C@@]1([H])[C@@]2([H])CCC2=CC(=O)CC[C@]12C,C19H28O2,"1S/C19H28O2/c1-18-9-7-13(20)11-12(18)3-4-14-15-5-6-17(21)19(15,2)10-8-16(14)18/h11,14-17,21H,3-10H2,1-2H3/t14-,15-,16-,17-,18-,19-/m0/s1",MUMGGOZAMZWBJJ-DYKIIFRCSA-N,"(1S,2R,10R,11S,14S,15S)-14-hydroxy-2,15-dimethyltetracyclo[8.7.0.0^{2,7}.0^{11,15}]heptadec-6-en-5-one",3.365423297666668,19.377705208106928,288.4244,288.20893014,3.33e-02 g/l,2.99,-3.94,2,1,0,37.3,84.42979999999999,33.875628274645216,"(1S,2R,10R,11S,14S,15S)-14-hydroxy-2,15-dimethyltetracyclo[8.7.0.0^{2,7}.0^{11,15}]heptadec-6-en-5-one",0,0,-0.883941123357545,19.08686012168563,1,4,1,1,1,0,MDB00000150,"5314,5328,5355,5356,5357,5403,5405,5465,5466"
121,Thiamine,"Thiamine or thiamin, also known as aneurin or vitamin B1, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as thiamines. It is a colorless compound with the chemical formula C12H17N4OS. Thiamines are compounds containing a thiamine moiety, which is structurally characterized by a 3-[(4-Amino-2-methyl-pyrimidin-5-yl)methyl]-4-methyl-thiazol-5-yl backbone. Thiamine exists in all living species, ranging from bacteria to plants to humans. Thiamine biosynthesis occurs in bacteria, some protozoans, plants, and fungi. Thiamine is a vitamin and an essential nutrient meaning the body cannot synthesize it, and it must be obtained from the diet. It is soluble in water and insoluble in alcohol. Thiamine decomposes if heated. Thiamine was first discovered in 1897 by Umetaro Suzuki in Japan when researching how rice bran cured patients of Beriberi. Thiamine was the first B vitamin to be isolated in 1926 and was first made in 1936. Thiamine plays a key role in intracellular glucose metabolism and it is thought that thiamine inhibits the effect of glucose and insulin on arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation. Thiamine plays an important role in helping the body convert carbohydrates and fat into energy. It is essential for normal growth and development and helps to maintain proper functioning of the heart and the nervous and digestive systems. Thiamine cannot be stored in the body; however, once absorbed, the vitamin is concentrated in muscle tissue. Thiamine has antioxidant, erythropoietic, cognition-and mood-modulatory, antiatherosclerotic, putative ergogenic, and detoxification activities. Natural derivatives of thiamine, such as thiamine monophosphate (ThMP), thiamine diphosphate (ThDP), also sometimes called thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), thiamine triphosphate (ThTP), and adenosine thiamine triphosphate (AThTP), act as coenzymes in addition to performing unique biological functions. Thiamine deficiency can lead to beriberi, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, optic neuropathy, Leigh's disease, African seasonal ataxia (or Nigerian seasonal ataxia), and central pontine myelinolysis. In Western countries, thiamine deficiency is seen mainly in chronic alcoholism. In adults (>18 years old) suffering from alcoholism, thiamine concentration is significantly reduced in the cerebrospinal fluid at a concentration of 0.02 +/- 0.00 μM (PMID: 182198) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 0.0487 +/- 0.00275 μM (PMID:  182198). Thiamine supplements or thiamine therapy can be used for the treatment of a number of disorders including thiamine and niacin deficiency states, Korsakov's alcoholic psychosis, Wernicke-Korsakov syndrome, delirium, and peripheral neuritis. In humans, thiamine is involved in the metabolic disorder called 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. Outside of the human body, Thiamine is found in high quantities in whole grains, legumes, pork, fruits, and yeast and fish. Grain processing removes much of the thiamine content in grains, so in many countries cereals and flours are enriched with thiamine. Thiamine has also been associated with patients - specifically the elderly (>65 years old) - undergoing hemodialysis where the blood concentration of thiamine is reduced at a concentration of 0.035 +/- 0.006 μM (PMID: 11684545) compared to normal elderly at a concentration of 0.096 +/- 0.018 μM (PMID: 11684545). Additionally, thiamine has been associated with Friedreich's Ataxia,  a genetic, progressive, neurodegenerative movement disorder where the typical age of onset is between 10 and 15 years. In individuals with  Friedreich's Ataxia, the cerebrospinal fluid concentration of thiamine is elevated at a concentration of  0.1 +/- 0.01 μM (PMID: 11383938) compared to normal individuals at a concentration of 0.0487 +/- 0.00275 μM (PMID: 182198).",HMDB0000235,CC1=C(CCO)SC=[N+]1CC1=CN=C(C)N=C1N,C12H17N4OS,"1S/C12H17N4OS/c1-8-11(3-4-17)18-7-16(8)6-10-5-14-9(2)15-12(10)13/h5,7,17H,3-4,6H2,1-2H3,(H2,13,14,15)/q+1",JZRWCGZRTZMZEH-UHFFFAOYSA-N,"3-[(4-amino-2-methylpyrimidin-5-yl)methyl]-5-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-methyl-1,3-thiazol-3-ium",-3.0974126491384126,19.25564694993423,265.355,265.112306876,1.53e-02 g/l,-2.11,-4.29,4,2,4,75.91,73.39970000000001,28.144123736165753,thiamine,1,1,5.5375484421713,15.504603864011504,1,2,1,0,0,0,MDB00000151,"5302,5345,5469,5534"
122,Propionic acid,"Propionic acid (PA) is an organic acid. It exists a clear liquid with a pungent and unpleasant smell somewhat resembling body odor. It is present naturally at low levels in dairy products and occurs ubiquitously, together with other short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), in the gastro-intestinal tract of humans and other mammals as an end-product of the microbial digestion of carbohydrates. The metabolism of propionic acid begins with its conversion to propionyl coenzyme A, the usual first step in the metabolism of carboxylic acids. Since propionic acid has three carbons, propionyl-CoA cannot directly enter either beta oxidation or the citric acid cycles. In most vertebrates, propionyl-CoA is carboxylated to D-methylmalonyl-CoA, which is isomerised to L-methylmalonyl-CoA. Propionic acid has significant physiological activity in animals. Propionic acid is irritant but produces no acute systemic effects and has no demonstrable genotoxic potential (PMID 1628870). The human skin is host of several species of bacteria known as Propionibacteria, which are named after their ability to produce propionic acid. The most notable one is the Cutibacterium acnes (formerly known as Propionibacterium acnes), which lives mainly in the sebaceous glands of the skin and is one of the principal causes of acne. Propionic aciduria is one of the most frequent organic acidurias, a disease that comprise many various disorders. The outcome of patients born with Propionic aciduria is poor intellectual development patterns, with 60% having an IQ less than 75 and requiring special education. Successful liver and/or renal transplantations, in a few patients, have resulted in better quality of life but have not necessarily prevented neurological and various visceral complications. These results emphasize the need for permanent metabolic follow-up whatever the therapeutic strategy (PMID 15868474). Decreased early mortality, less severe symptoms at diagnosis, and more favorable short-term neurodevelopmental outcome were recorded in patients identified through expanded newborn screening. (PMID 16763906)↵ When propionic acid is infused directly into rodents' brains, it produces hyperactivity, dystonia, social impairment, perseveration and brain changes (e.g., innate neuroinflammation, glutathione depletion) that may be used as a means to model autism in rats.",HMDB0000237,CCC(O)=O,C3H6O2,"1S/C3H6O2/c1-2-3(4)5/h2H2,1H3,(H,4,5)",XBDQKXXYIPTUBI-UHFFFAOYSA-N,propanoic acid,0.47719013266666654,,74.0785,74.036779436,3.52e+02 g/l,0.31,0.68,2,1,1,37.3,17.2706,7.24434341571555,propanoic acid,0,-1,,4.7546711681673255,1,0,1,0,1,0,MDB00000152,"5202,5256,5312,5313"

124,Pyridoxine,"Pyridoxine, also known vitamin B6, is commonly found in food and is used as a dietary supplement. It is readily converted to pyridoxal phosphate which is a coenzyme for synthesis of amino acids, neurotransmitters (serotonin, norepinephrine), sphingolipids, aminolevulinic acid. Although pyridoxine and Vitamin B6 are still frequently used as synonyms, especially by medical researchers, this practice is erroneous and sometimes misleading (EE Snell; Ann NY Acad Sci, vol 585 pg 1, 1990). Pyridoxine is one of the compounds that can be called vitamin B6. Pyridoxine assists in the balancing of sodium and potassium as well as promoting red blood cell production. It is linked to cancer immunity and helps fight the formation of homocysteine. It has been suggested that Pyridoxine might help children with learning difficulties, and may also prevent dandruff, eczema, and psoriasis. In addition, pyridoxine can help balance hormonal changes in women and aid in immune system. Lack of pyridoxine may cause anemia, nerve damage, seizures, skin problems, and sores in the mouth (Wikipedia). Deficiency of pyridoxine, though rare because of widespread distribution in foods, leads to the development of peripheral neuritis in adults and affects the central nervous system in children (DOSE - 3rd edition). As a supplement pyridoxine is used to treat and prevent pyridoxine deficiency, sideroblastic anaemia, pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy, certain metabolic disorders, problems from isoniazid, and certain types of mushroom poisoning.",HMDB0000239,CC1=C(O)C(CO)=C(CO)C=N1,C8H11NO3,"1S/C8H11NO3/c1-5-8(12)7(4-11)6(3-10)2-9-5/h2,10-12H,3-4H2,1H3",LXNHXLLTXMVWPM-UHFFFAOYSA-N,"4,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)-2-methylpyridin-3-ol",-0.9513212983333332,14.533140285427315,169.1778,169.073893223,1.61e+01 g/l,-0.57,-1.02,4,3,2,73.58000000000001,44.1053,17.112304740817216,pyridoxine,0,0,5.584997111043129,9.397430003835803,1,1,1,0,0,0,MDB00000154,"5201,5205"
125,Pyruvic acid,"Pyruvic acid or pyruvate is a simple alpha-keto acid. It is a three-carbon molecule containing a carboxylic acid group and a ketone functional group. Pyruvate is the simplest alpha-keto acid and according to official nomenclature by IUPAC, it is called alpha-keto propanoic acid. Like other keto acids, pyruvic acid can tautomerize from its ketone form to its enol form, containing a double bond and an alcohol. Pyruvate is found in all living organisms ranging from bacteria to plants to humans. It is an intermediate compound in the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Pyruvate is a key intermediate in several metabolic pathways throughout the cell. In particular, pyruvic acid can be made from glucose through glycolysis, converted back to carbohydrates (such as glucose) via gluconeogenesis, or to fatty acids through a reaction with acetyl-CoA. Pyruvic acid supplies energy to cells through the citric acid cycle (TCA or Krebs cycle) when oxygen is present (aerobic respiration), and alternatively ferments to produce lactate when oxygen is lacking (lactic acid). In glycolysis, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) is converted to pyruvate by pyruvate kinase. This reaction is strongly exergonic and irreversible. In gluconeogenesis, it takes two enzymes, pyruvate carboxylase and PEP carboxykinase, to catalyze the reverse transformation of pyruvate to PEP. In thiamine deficiency, its oxidation is retarded and it accumulates in the tissues, especially in nervous structures.  Pyruvic acid is also a metabolite of Corynebacterium (PMID: 27872963 ). Pyruvic acid has shown to be associated as a disease biomarker in colorectal cancer where increased levels of pyruvic acid is detected in individuals with colorectal cancer however, it has not been quantified (PMID: 27015276). Pyruvic acid has also been associated with a range of deficiency diseases : Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Phosphatase Deficiency, Fructose 1,6 Bisphosphatase Deficiency, Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Deficiency and Fumarase Deficiency. In infant (0-1 year old) with fumarase deficiency, the cerebrospinal fluid concentration of pyruvic acid is significantly elevated at a concentration of 253 - 345 μM (PMID: 24182348) compared to normal infants at a concentration of 30 -130 μM (PMID: 24182348). Similarly, in children (1-13 years old) with pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, the cerebrospinal fluid concentration of pyruvic acid is significantly elevated at a concentration of  570 +/- 400 μM (PMID: 22079328) compared to normal children at a concentration of 27 +/- 11 μM (PMID: 11893004). A similar trend is observed in all deficiencies listed above. Pyruvic acid is also associated with Leigh syndrome, G.R.A.C.I.L.E. Syndrome and Pearson Marrow Pancreas Syndrome. Leigh syndrome is a severe neurological disorder that usually becomes apparent in the first year of life and is characterized by progressive loss of mental and movement abilities (psychomotor regression). In infants (0-1 year old) with Leigh syndrome, blood concentration of pyruvic acid is significantly elevated at a concentration of 499.647 μM (PMID: 4873809) compared to normal infants at a concentration of 56.778 μM (PMID: 4873809).

126,Riboflavin,"Riboflavin or vitamin B2 is an easily absorbed, water-soluble micronutrient with a key role in maintaining human health. Like the other B vitamins, it supports energy production by aiding in the metabolizing of fats, carbohydrates, and proteins. Vitamin B2 is also required for red blood cell formation and respiration, antibody production, and for regulating human growth and reproduction. It is essential for healthy skin, nails, hair growth and general good health, including regulating thyroid activity. Riboflavin is found in milk, eggs, malted barley, liver, kidney, heart, and leafy vegetables. Riboflavin is yellow or orange-yellow in color and in addition to being used as a food coloring it is also used to fortify some foods. It can be found in baby foods, breakfast cereals, sauces, processed cheese, fruit drinks and vitamin-enriched milk products. The richest natural source is yeast. It occurs in the free form only in the retina of the eye, in whey, and in urine; its principal forms in tissues and cells are as flavin mononucleotide and flavin adenine dinucleotide.↵",HMDB0000244,CC1=C(C)C=C2N(C[C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)CO)C3=NC(=O)NC(=O)C3=NC2=C1,C17H20N4O6,"1S/C17H20N4O6/c1-7-3-9-10(4-8(7)2)21(5-11(23)14(25)12(24)6-22)15-13(18-9)16(26)20-17(27)19-15/h3-4,11-12,14,22-25H,5-6H2,1-2H3,(H,20,26,27)/t11-,12+,14-/m0/s1",AUNGANRZJHBGPY-SCRDCRAPSA-N,"7,8-dimethyl-10-[(2S,3S,4R)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydroxypentyl]-2H,3H,4H,10H-benzo[g]pteridine-2,4-dione",-0.9165402600000004,12.852833299641368,376.3639,376.138284392,6.57e-01 g/l,-1.05,-2.76,9,5,5,155.04999999999998,96.2684,37.50970932405913,riboflavin,0,-1,-2.610702399953126,5.969939364997856,1,3,1,0,0,0,MDB00000157,"5370,5407,5469"
127,Porphobilinogen,"Porphobilinogen (PBG) is a pyrrole-containing intermediate in the biosynthesis of porphyrins. It consists of a pyrrole ring with acetyl, propionyl, and aminomethyl side chains. It is a key monopyrrolic intermediate in porphyrin, chlorophyll and vitamin B12 biosynthesis. Porphobilinogen is generated from aminolevulinate (ALA) by the enzyme ALA dehydratase Porphobilinogen is then converted into hydroxymethylbilane by the enzyme porphobilinogen deaminase (also known as hydroxymethylbilane synthase). Under certain conditions, porphobilinogen can act as a phototoxin, a neurotoxin, and a metabotoxin. A phototoxin leads to cell damage upon exposure to light. A neurotoxin causes damage to nerve cells and nerve tissues. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of porphyrins are associated with porphyrias such as porphyria variegate, acute intermittent porphyria, and hereditary coproporphyria (HCP). There are several types of porphyrias (most are inherited). Hepatic porphyrias are characterized by acute neurological attacks (seizures, psychosis, extreme back and abdominal pain, and an acute polyneuropathy), while the erythropoietic forms present with skin problems (usually a light-sensitive blistering rash and increased hair growth). Also, the neurotoxicity of porphyrins may be due to their selective interactions with tubulin, which disrupt microtubule formation and cause neural malformations (PMID: 3441503 ). In adult (>18 years old) with porphyria, blood concentration of PBG is significantly elevated at a concentration of 3.1 +/- 1.0 μM (PMID: 16497943) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 0.06 (0.00-0.12) μM (PMID: 16497943). Also, in adults with acute intermittent porphyria, PBG is significantly elevated in the urine at a concentration of 57.1 (19.6-132.7) μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 23908454) compared to normal adults at a PBG concentration of 0-1.5 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 23908454). PBG has also been associated with Erythropoietic protoporphyria where adults (>18 years old) with the condition have shown the concentration of PBG in urine to be significantly elevated at 0.589-0.654 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 13765301) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 0-1.5 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 23908454).",HMDB0000245,NCC1=C(CC(O)=O)C(CCC(O)=O)=CN1,C10H14N2O4,"1S/C10H14N2O4/c11-4-8-7(3-10(15)16)6(5-12-8)1-2-9(13)14/h5,12H,1-4,11H2,(H,13,14)(H,15,16)",QSHWIQZFGQKFMA-UHFFFAOYSA-N,3-[5-(aminomethyl)-4-(carboxymethyl)-1H-pyrrol-3-yl]propanoic acid,-2.6797758986088773,4.3999884503565605,226.2292,226.095356946,2.72e+00 g/l,-2.40,-1.92,5,4,6,116.41,56.3839,22.557878019255046,porphobilinogen,0,-1,8.782950994059014,3.6647253376201103,1,1,1,0,0,0,MDB00000158,"5197,5198"

129,Thyroxine,"Thyroxine or T4 is one of two major hormones derived from the thyroid gland, the other being triiodothyronine (T3). The major form of thyroid hormone in the blood is thyroxine (T4), which has a longer half-life than T3. In humans, the ratio of T4 to T3 released into the blood is approximately 14:1. T4 is converted to the active T3 (three to four times more potent than T4) within cells by deiodinases (5′-iodinase). Thyroxine is synthesized via the iodination of tyrosines (monoiodotyrosine) and the coupling of iodotyrosines (diiodotyrosine) in the thyroglobulin. Thyroxine is released from thyroglobulin by proteolysis and secreted into the blood. Thyroxine is peripherally deiodinated to form triiodothyronine which exerts a broad spectrum of stimulatory effects on cell metabolism.  Thyroid hormones function via a well-studied set of nuclear receptors, termed the thyroid hormone receptors. They act on nearly every cell in the body. In particular, thyroid hormones act to increase the basal metabolic rate, affect protein synthesis, help regulate long bone growth (synergy with growth hormone) and neural maturation, and increase the body's sensitivity to catecholamines (such as adrenaline) by permissiveness. The thyroid hormones are essential to proper development and differentiation of all cells of the human body. These hormones also regulate protein, fat, and carbohydrate metabolism, affecting how human cells use energetic compounds. They also stimulate vitamin metabolism. Numerous physiological and pathological stimuli influence thyroid hormone synthesis.

130,Taurine,"Taurine is a sulfur amino acid like methionine, cystine, cysteine, and homocysteine. It is a lesser-known amino acid because it is not incorporated into the structural building blocks of protein. Yet taurine is an essential amino acid in pre-term and newborn infants of humans and many other species. Adults can synthesize their own taurine, yet are probably dependent, in part, on dietary taurine. Taurine is abundant in the brain, heart, breast, gallbladder, and kidney and has important roles in health and disease in these organs. Taurine has many diverse biological functions including serving as a neurotransmitter in the brain, a stabilizer of cell membranes, and a facilitator in the transport of ions such as sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium. Taurine is highly concentrated in animal and fish protein, which are good sources of dietary taurine. It can be synthesized by the body from cysteine when vitamin B6 is present. Deficiency of taurine occurs in premature infants, neonates fed formula milk, and various disease states. Several inborn errors of taurine metabolism have been described. Perry syndrome is an unusual neuropsychiatric disorder inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion through three generations of a family. Symptoms began late in the fifth decade in 6 affected persons and death occurred after 4 to 6 years. The earliest and most prominent symptom was mental depression that was not responsive to antidepressant drugs or electroconvulsive therapy. Sleep disturbances, exhaustion, and marked weight loss were features. Parkinsonism developed later, and respiratory failure occurred terminally (OMIM: 168605 ). Hypertaurinuric cardiomyopathy describes congestive cardiomyopathy and markedly elevated urinary taurine levels (about 5 times normal). Other family members had late or holosystolic mitral valve prolapse and elevated urinary taurine values (about 2.5 times normal). In two with mitral valve prolapse, congestive cardiomyopathy eventually developed while the amounts of urinary taurine doubled (OMIM: 145350 ). Taurine, after GABA, is the second most important inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. Its inhibitory effect is one source of taurine's anticonvulsant and anti anxiety properties. It also lowers glutamic acid in the brain, and preliminary clinical trials suggest taurine may be useful in some forms of epilepsy. Taurine in the brain is usually associated with zinc or manganese. The amino acids alanine and glutamic acid, as well as pantothenic acid, inhibit taurine metabolism while vitamins A and B6, zinc, and manganese help build taurine. Cysteine and B6 are the nutrients most directly involved in taurine synthesis. Taurine levels have been found to decrease significantly in many depressed patients. One reason that the findings are not entirely clear is that taurine is often elevated in the blood of epileptics who need it. It is often difficult to distinguish compensatory changes in human biochemistry from true metabolic or deficiency disease. Low levels of taurine are found in retinitis pigmentosa. Taurine deficiency in experimental animals produces degeneration of light-sensitive cells. Therapeutic applications of taurine to eye disease are likely to be forthcoming. Taurine has many important metabolic roles. Supplements can stimulate prolactin and insulin release. The parathyroid gland makes a peptide hormone called glutataurine (glutamic acid-taurine), which further demonstrates taurine's role in endocrinology. Taurine increases bilirubin and cholesterol excretion in bile, critical to normal gallbladder function. It seems to inhibit the effect of morphine and potentiates the effects of opiate antagonists. Low plasma taurine levels have been found in a variety of conditions, i.e. depression, hypertension, hypothyroidism, gout, institutionalized patients, infertility, obesity, kidney failure, and others. In individuals with kidney disease, taurine is found to be significantly decreased in the blood at a concentration of 0.039 (0.0027-0.057) μmol/mmol compared to the blood of normal individuals at a concentration of 54.7 μmol/mmol (PMID : 19309105). Taurine has been found to be significantly elevated in individuals with schizophrenia at a concentration of 67 +/- 20 μM compared to normal individuals at a taurine concentration of 61 +/- 17 μM (PMID : 2415198).",HMDB0000251,NCCS(O)(=O)=O,C2H7NO3S,"1S/C2H7NO3S/c3-1-2-7(4,5)6/h1-3H2,(H,4,5,6)",XOAAWQZATWQOTB-UHFFFAOYSA-N,2-aminoethane-1-sulfonic acid,-2.6146873946423876,,125.147,125.014663785,1.05e+02 g/l,-2.19,-0.08,4,2,2,80.39,24.605100000000004,10.824350988998525,taurine,0,0,9.343935759428495,-1.4937847370487942,1,0,1,0,0,0,MDB00000163,"5206,5258,5275,5285,5305,5313"
131,Pregnenolone,"Pregnenolone is a derivative of cholesterol, the product of cytochrome P450 side-chain cleavage (EC 1.14.15.6, CYP11A1. This reaction consists of three consecutive monooxygenations, a 22-hydroxylation, a 20-hydroxylation, and the cleavage of the C20-C22 bond, yielding pregnenolone. Pregnenolone is the precursor to gonadal steroid hormones and the adrenal corticosteroids. This reaction occurs in steroid hormone-producing tissues such as the adrenal cortex, corpus luteum, and placenta. The most notable difference between the placenta and other steroidogenic tissues is that electron supply to CYP11A1 limits the rate at which cholesterol is converted into pregnenolone in the placenta. The limiting component for electron delivery to CYP11A1 is the concentration of adrenodoxin reductase in the mitochondrial matrix which is insufficient to maintain the adrenodoxin pool in a fully reduced state. Pregnenolone is also a neurosteroid, and is produced in the spinal cord; CYP11A1 is the key enzyme catalyzing the conversion of cholesterol into pregnenolone, the rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of all classes of steroids, and has been localized in sensory networks of the spinal cord dorsal horn. In the adrenal glomerulosa cell, angiotensin II, one of the major physiological regulators of mineralocorticoid synthesis, appears to affect most of the cholesterol transfer to the mitochondrial outer membrane and many steps in the transport to the inner membrane. Thus, it exerts a powerful control over the use of cholesterol for aldosterone production (PMID: 17222962 , 15823613 , 16632873 , 15134809). Pregnenolone is associated with a series of pregnancy related conditions such as Premenstrual dysphoric disorder, Prepartum depression as well as Postpartum depression. In adult (>18 years old) with premenstrual dysphoric disorder, the concentration of pregnenolone in the blood is significantly elevated at a concentration of 0.00169 +/- 0.00107 μM (PMID: 12215085) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 0.00083 +/- 0.00080 μM (PMID: 12215085). Similarly, in adult females (>18 years old) with prepartum depression, pregnenolone is elevated in the blood at a concentration of 0.0423 +/- 0.0130 μM (PMID: 11739473) compared to normal adult females at a concentration of 0.00186 +/- 0.00090 μM (PMID: 11739473). In adult females (>18 years old) with postpartum depression, pregnenolone is significantly elevated in the blood at a concentration of 0.00974 +/- 0.00371 μM (PMID: 11739473) compared to normal adult females at a concentration of 0.00186 +/- 0.00090 μM (PMID: 11739473). Pregnenolone is also associated with Congenital Adrenal insufficiency with 46,XY sex reversal, partial or complete which is a genetic disorder that affects the adrenal glands. In female newborns (0-30 days old) with this disorder, pregnenolone is significantly reduced in the blood at a concentration of 0.00401 μM (PMID: 18182448) compared to normal infants at a concentration of 0.034 (0.00474-0.0632) μM (PMID: 18182448).",HMDB0000253,[H][C@@]12CC[C@H](C(C)=O)[C@@]1(C)CC[C@@]1([H])C2CC=C2C[C@H](O)CC[C@]12C,C21H32O2,"1S/C21H32O2/c1-13(22)17-6-7-18-16-5-4-14-12-15(23)8-10-20(14,2)19(16)9-11-21(17,18)3/h4,15-19,23H,5-12H2,1-3H3/t15-,16?,17-,18+,19+,20+,21-/m1/s1",ORNBQBCIOKFOEO-STZXPNGSSA-N,"1-[(1S,2R,5S,10S,11S,14S,15S)-5-hydroxy-2,15-dimethyltetracyclo[8.7.0.0^{2,7}.0^{11,15}]heptadec-7-en-14-yl]ethan-1-one",3.581358452666668,19.403038799839706,316.4776,316.240230268,1.36e-02 g/l,4.06,-4.37,2,1,1,37.3,93.7567,38.08645703431432,"1-[(1S,2R,5S,10S,11S,14S,15S)-5-hydroxy-2,15-dimethyltetracyclo[8.7.0.0^{2,7}.0^{11,15}]heptadec-7-en-14-yl]ethanone",0,0,-1.3972432940071755,18.20428950550382,1,4,1,1,1,0,MDB00000165,"5196,5393,5466"
132,Succinic acid,"Succinic acid (succinate) is a dicarboxylic acid. It is an important component of the citric acid or TCA cycle and is capable of donating electrons to the electron transfer chain. Succinate is found in all living organisms ranging from bacteria to plants to mammals. In eukaryotes, succinate is generated in the mitochondria via the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA). The anion, succinate, is a component of the citric acid cycle capable of donating electrons to the electron transfer chain. Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) plays an important role in the mitochondria, being both part of the respiratory chain and the Krebs cycle. SDH with a covalently attached FAD prosthetic group, binds enzyme substrates (succinate and fumarate) and physiological regulators (oxaloacetate and ATP). Oxidizing succinate links SDH to the fast-cycling Krebs cycle portion where it participates in the breakdown of acetyl-CoA throughout the whole Krebs cycle. Mutations in the four genes encoding the subunits of the mitochondrial respiratory chain succinate dehydrogenase are associated with a wide spectrum of clinical presentations (i.e.: Huntington's disease (PMID 11803021 ). Succinate can readily be imported into the mitochondrial matrix by the n-butylmalonate- (or phenylsuccinate-) sensitive dicarboxylate carrier in exchange with inorganic phosphate or another organic acid, e. g. malate (PMID 16143825 ). Succinate can exit the mitochondrial matrix and function in the cytoplasm as well as the extracellular space. Succinate has multiple biological roles including roles as a metabolic intermediate and roles as a cell signalling molecule. Succinate can alter gene expression patterns, thereby modulating the epigenetic landscape or it can exhibit hormone-like signalling functions (PMID: 26971832 ). As such, succinate links cellular metabolism, especially ATP formation, to the regulation of cellular function. Succinate can be broken down or metabolized into fumarate by the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), which is part of the electron transport chain involved in making ATP. Dysregulation of succinate synthesis, and therefore ATP synthesis, can happen in a number of genetic mitochondrial diseases, such as Leigh syndrome, and Melas syndrome. Succinate has been found to be associated with D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria, which is an inborn error of metabolism. Succinic acid has recently been identified as an oncometabolite or an endogenous, cancer causing metabolite. High levels of this organic acid can be found in tumors or biofluids surrounding tumors. Its oncogenic action appears to due to its ability to inhibit prolyl hydroxylase-containing enzymes. In many tumours, oxygen availability becomes limited (hypoxia) very quickly due to rapid cell proliferation and limited blood vessel growth. The major regulator of the response to hypoxia is the HIF transcription factor (HIF-alpha). Under normal oxygen levels, protein levels of HIF-alpha are very low due to constant degradation, mediated by a series of post-translational modification events catalyzed by the prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing enzymes PHD1, 2 and 3, (also known as EglN2, 1 and 3) that hydroxylate HIF-alpha and lead to its degradation. All three of the PHD enzymes are inhibited by succinate. In humans, urinary succinic acid is produced by Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Enterobacter, Acinetobacter, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter frundii, Enterococcus faecalis (PMID: 22292465 ). Succinic acid is also found in Actinobacillus, Anaerobiospirillum, Mannheimia, Corynebacterium and Basfia (PMID: 22292465 ; PMID: 18191255 ; PMID: 26360870). Succinic acid is associated with pregnancy and is found to be reduced in the blood of adult females (>18 years old) at a concentration of 5.6 (12.5) μM (PMID: 22494326) compared to normal adult females at a concentration of 23.5 (12.7-34.3) μM (PMID: 21359215). Also, in adult females (>18 years old) with early preeclampsia, succinic acid is found to be significantly reduced at a concentration of 4.3 (1.6) μM (PMID: 22494326) compared to normal female adults at a concentration of 23.5 (12.7-34.3) μM (PMID: 21359215). Succinic acid has also been associated with colorectal cancer but has not been quantified. Succinic acid is associated with lung cancer where adults (>18 years old) with lung cancer have shown significantly reduced levels of succinic acid in the urine at a concentration of 9.0 +/- 6.0 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 18953024) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 76.0 (64.0-76.0) μmol/mmol (PMID: 21388201). Succinic acid has also shown to be associated with Canavan disease and Alzheimer’s Disease. In adults (>18 years old) with Canavan disease, succinic acid has shown to be reduced in the cerebrospinal fluid at a concentration of 19.0 (0.0-38.0) μM (PMID: 7729054) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 19 μM (PMID: 7729054). Similarly, in individuals with Alzheimer’s Disease, succinic acid is significantly reduced in the cerebrospinal fluid at a concentration of 55.0 (19.0-91.0) μM (PMID: 9693263) compared to normal individuals at a concentration of 150.0 +/- 110.0 μM (PMID: 9693263).",HMDB0000254,OC(=O)CCC(O)=O,C4H6O4,"1S/C4H6O4/c5-3(6)1-2-4(7)8/h1-2H2,(H,5,6)(H,7,8)",KDYFGRWQOYBRFD-UHFFFAOYSA-N,butanedioic acid,-0.3984829673333332,5.6869121792916,118.088,118.02660868,2.11e+02 g/l,-0.53,0.25,4,2,3,74.6,23.537,10.141334051490146,succinic acid,0,-2,,3.5541665109763474,1,0,1,0,0,0,MDB00000166,"5176,5186,5304,5338,5343,5376,5390,5440,5445,5521"
133,Thiosulfate,"Thiosulfate is a sulfur containing sulfate ion. It occurs naturally in hot springs and geysers, and is produced by certain biochemical processes. In the body, thiosulfate converts small amounts of cyanide ion into harmless products and plays a role in the biosynthesis of cysteine, a sulfur-containing amino acid that locks proteins into their correct three-dimensional shapes. Thiosulfate is not found in large quantities in nature. Solutions of thiosulfate break down into sulfur, sulfites, and sulfates when exposed to acids, light, metal ions, and bacteria. Thiosulfate is sometimes used as an antidote for cyanide poisoning. It reacts with cyanide to produce sulfite and thiocyanate ions: CN- + S2O32- SCN- + SO32- This reaction is catalyzed by an enzyme produced by cell mitochondria to neutralize small quantities of ingested cyanide (which occurs naturally in cassava root, lima beans, and almonds!). Thiosulfate is an intermediate in several biochemical pathways, including the synthesis of L-cysteine. Thiosulfate is manufactured by some cells by oxidation of elemental sulfur and by degradation of L-cysteine. Use: Photography (fixing agent to dissolve unchanged silver salts from exposed negatives), chrome tanning, removing chlorine in bleaching and papermaking, extraction of silver from its ores, dechlorination of water, mordant, reagent, bleaching, reducing agent in chrome dyeing, sequestrant in salt (up to 0.1%), antidote for cyanide poisoning. (Hawley's Condensed Chemical Dictionary) Source/Synthesis: Synthesis by dehydration of the pentahydrate at 105 degree. Alternatively formed by reaction of S2Cl2 with Na2O2 or by reduction of Na2S2O4 with sodium amalgam Use/Importance: Commercially available Biological Use/Importance: Cyanide antidote often administered with other antidotes, antifungal agent (ChemNetBase) Sodium thiosulfate is a common analytical reagent used in iodometric titration to analyze chlorine, bromine, and sulfide. Other uses are in bleaching paper pulp, bleaching straw, ivory, and bones, for removing chlorine from solutions, silver extraction from its ores, a mordant in dyeing and printing textiles, and as an antidote to cyanide poisoning.

134,Serotonin,"Serotonin or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) is a molecule that belongs to the class of compounds known as indoleamines. An indoleamine consists of an indole ring that bears an amino group or an alkyl amino group attached to the indole ring. Serotonin has an aminoethyl at position 2 and a hydroxyl group at position 5 of the indole ring. Serotonin exists in all living organisms, ranging from bacteria to plants to humans. In mammals, serotonin functions as a monoamine neurotransmitter, a biochemical messenger and regulator. It is synthesized from the essential amino acid L-Tryptophan. Approximately 90% of the human body's total serotonin is located in the enterochromaffin cells in the GI tract, where it regulates intestinal movements. About 8% is found in platelets and 1-2% in the CNS. Serotonin in the nervous system acts as a local transmitter at synapses, and as a paracrine or hormonal modulator of circuits upon diffusion, allowing a wide variety of ""state-dependent"" behavioral responses to different stimuli. Serotonin is widely distributed in the nervous system of vertebrates and invertebrates and some of its behavioral effects have been preserved along evolution. Such is the case of aggressive behavior and rhythmic motor patterns, including those responsible for feeding. In vertebrates, which display a wider and much more sophisticated behavioral repertoire, serotonin also modulates sleep, the arousal state, sexual behavior, and others. Deficiencies of the serotonergic system causes disorders such as depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, phobias, posttraumatic stress disorder, epilepsy, and generalized anxiety disorder. Serotonin has three different modes of action in the nervous system: as transmitter, acting locally at synaptic boutons; upon diffusion at a distance from its release sites, producing paracrine (also called volume) effects, and by circulating in the bloodstream, producing hormonal effects. The three modes can affect a single neuronal circuit. (PMID: 16047543). Serotonin is also a microbial metabolite that can be found in the feces and urine of mammals. Urinary serotonin is produced by Candida, Streptococcus, Escherichia, and Enterococcus (PMID: 24621061). In plants, serotonin was first found and reported in a legume called Mucuna pruriens. The greatest concentration of serotonin in plants has been found in walnuts and hickory. In pineapples, banana, kiwi fruit, plums and tomatoes the concentration of serotonin is around 3 to 30 mg/kg. Serotonin is associated with Parkinson’s Disease and Schizophrenia. In adults (>18 years old) with Parkinson’s Disease, serotonin is shown to be reduced in the cerebrospinal fluid at a concentration of 0.0044 (0.00-0.0093) μM (PMID: 12834252) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 0.0089 (0.0057-0.012) μM (PMID: 2580417). Similarly, in adults (>18 years old) with schizophrenia, serotonin is shown to be reduced in the blood at a concentration of 0.61 +/- 0.096 μM (PMID: 25004141) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 0.85 +/- 0.077 μM (PMID: 25004141). Serotonin has also shown to be associated with Hypothyroidism where adults (>18 years old) have shown to have reduced serotonin levels in the cerebrospinal fluid at a concentration of 0.00001 +/- 0.000004 μM (PMID: 9849813) compared to normal individuals at a concentration of 0.0053-0.01 μM (PMID: 2580417).",HMDB0000259,NCCC1=CNC2=CC=C(O)C=C12,C10H12N2O,"1S/C10H12N2O/c11-4-3-7-6-12-10-2-1-8(13)5-9(7)10/h1-2,5-6,12-13H,3-4,11H2",QZAYGJVTTNCVMB-UHFFFAOYSA-N,3-(2-aminoethyl)-1H-indol-5-ol,0.48154800923293156,18.223535339159515,176.2151,176.094963016,2.50e+00 g/l,0.56,-1.85,2,3,2,62.040000000000006,52.3538,19.313416912562396,serotonin,0,1,10.004289627293197,9.314034178077875,1,2,1,1,0,0,MDB00000170,"5226,5227,5303,5313,5331,5371"
135,Thymine,"Thymine, also known as 5-methyluracil, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as hydroxypyrimidines. These are organic compounds containing a hydroxyl group attached to a pyrimidine ring. Pyrimidine is a 6-membered ring consisting of four carbon atoms and two nitrogen centers at the 1- and 3- ring positions. Thymine was first isolated in 1893 by Albrecht Kossel and Albert Neumann from calves' thymus glands, hence its name. Thymine is one of the 4 nucleobases found in DNA and is essential to all life. Thymine exists in all living species, ranging from bacteria to plants to humans. Thymine combined with deoxyribose creates the nucleoside deoxythymidine (also called thymidine) which when phosphorylated to dTDP can be incorporated into DNA via DNA polymerases. Thymidine can be phosphorylated with up to three phosphoric acid groups, producing dTMP (deoxythymidine monophosphate) dTDP and/or dTTP. In RNA thymine is replaced with uracil in most cases. In DNA, thymine binds to adenine via two hydrogen bonds to assist in stabilizing the nucleic acid structures. Within humans, thymine participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, thymine and deoxyribose 1-phosphate can be biosynthesized from thymidine through its interaction with the enzyme thymidine phosphorylase. In addition, thymine can be converted into dihydrothymine; which is mediated by the enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase [NADP(+)]. Thymine is associated with Beta Ureidopropionase Deficiency and Dihydropyrimidinase Deficiency. In adults (>18 years old) with beta-ureidopropionase deficiency, thymine has shown to be reduced in the blood at a concentration of 0.04 - 0.2 μM (PMID: 15385443) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 0.0 - 0.1 μM (PMID: 15385443). Similarly, in adults (>18 years old) with dihydropyrimidinase deficiency, thymine has shown to be reduced in the urine at a concentration of 343.024 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 2109146) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 0.791 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 2109146).",HMDB0000262,CC1=CNC(=O)NC1=O,C5H6N2O2,"1S/C5H6N2O2/c1-3-2-6-5(9)7-4(3)8/h2H,1H3,(H2,6,7,8,9)",RWQNBRDOKXIBIV-UHFFFAOYSA-N,"5-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrimidine-2,4-dione",-0.45974051066666644,14.002512971014774,126.1133,126.042927446,1.08e+01 g/l,-0.99,-1.07,2,2,0,58.2,30.326400000000003,11.422204494643946,thymine,0,0,-4.998777587344984,9.057944384019686,1,1,1,0,0,0,MDB00000171,"5296,5373"
136,Liothyronine,"Liothyronine which is also known as Triiodothyronine or T3 is a thyroid hormone.  Liothyronine is the manufactured form of T3. Triiodothyronine is a thyroid hormone normally synthesized and secreted by the thyroid gland in much smaller quantities than thyroxine (T4). Most T3 is derived from peripheral monodeiodination of T4 at the 5' position of the outer ring of the iodothyronine nucleus.  Triiodothyronine or T3 is one of two major hormones derived from the thyroid gland, the other being thyroxine (T4). The major form of thyroid hormone in the blood is thyroxine (T4), which has a longer half-life than T3. In humans, the ratio of T4 to T3 released into the blood is approximately 14:1. T4 is converted to the active T3 (three to four times more potent than T4) within cells by deiodinases (5′-iodinase). Thyroid hormones function via a well-studied set of nuclear receptors, termed the thyroid hormone receptors. They act on nearly every cell in the body. In particular, thyroid hormones act to increase the basal metabolic rate, affect protein synthesis, help regulate long bone growth (synergy with growth hormone) and neural maturation, and increase the body's sensitivity to catecholamines (such as adrenaline) by permissiveness. The thyroid hormones are essential to proper development and differentiation of all cells of the human body. These hormones also regulate protein, fat, and carbohydrate metabolism, affecting how human cells use energetic compounds. They also stimulate vitamin metabolism.

137,Pyroglutamic acid,"Pyroglutamic acid (5-oxoproline) is a cyclized derivative of L-glutamic acid. It is an uncommon amino acid derivative in which the free amino group of glutamic acid cyclizes to form a lactam. It is formed non enzymatically from glutamate, glutamine, and gamma-glutamylated peptides, but it can also be produced by the action of gamma-glutamylcyclotransferase on an L-amino acid. Elevated blood levels may be associated with problems of glutamine or glutathione metabolism. This compound is found in substantial amounts in brain tissue and other tissues in bound form, especially skin. It is also present in plant tissues. It is sold, over the counter, as a ""smart drug"" for improving blood circulation in the brain. Pyroglutamate in the urine is a biomarker for the consμmption of cheese. When present in sufficiently high levels, pyroglutamic acid can act as an acidogen and a metabotoxin. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of pyroglutamic acid are associated with at least five inborn errors of metabolism including 5-oxoprolinuria, 5-oxoprolinase deficiency, glutathione synthetase deficiency, hawkinsinuria, and propionic acidemia. In adults (>18 years old) with glutathione synthetase deficiency, pyroglutamic acid is significantly elevated in the blood at a concentration of 87.00 (13.00-161.00) μM (MetaGene) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 19.5 +/- 3.7 μM (PMID: 18029477). Similarly, in children (1-13 years old) with 5-oxoprolinase deficiency, pyroglutamic acid is significantly elevated in the urine at a concentration of 28.8 5570 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 25129617 ) compared to normal children at a concentration of 5.3 (2.9-10.4) μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 8087979). Pyroglutamic acid is an organic acid. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Specifically, in adults (>18 years old) with pyroglutamic aciduria, pyroglutamic acid is significantly reduced in the urine at a concentration of 1.9 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 8013094) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 20.7 (10.2-32.6) μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 24023812). Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart, liver, and kidney abnormalities, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of the untreated IEMs mentioned above. Many affected children with organic acidemias experience intellectual disability or delayed development. In adults, acidosis or acidemia is characterized by headaches, confusion, feeling tired, tremors, sleepiness, and seizures. It has been shown that pyroglutamic acid releases GABA from the cerebral cortex and displays anti-anxiety effects in a simple approach-avoidance conflict situation in the rat. In clinical pharmacology experiments, pyroglutamic acid significantly shortens the plasma half-life of ethanol during acute intoxication.",HMDB0000267,OC(=O)[C@@H]1CCC(=O)N1,C5H7NO3,"1S/C5H7NO3/c7-4-2-1-3(6-4)5(8)9/h3H,1-2H2,(H,6,7)(H,8,9)/t3-/m0/s1",ODHCTXKNWHHXJC-VKHMYHEASA-N,(2S)-5-oxopyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid,-0.8896697023333333,12.760445138872075,129.114,129.042593095,1.51e+02 g/l,-1.01,0.07,3,2,1,66.4,28.0878,11.55635110215903,pyroglutamic acid,0,-1,-2.2244398721602403,3.613354339229633,1,1,1,0,0,0,MDB00000174,"5235,5313"
138,Sarcosine,"Sarcosine is the N-methyl derivative of glycine. Sarcosine is metabolized to glycine by the enzyme sarcosine dehydrogenase, while glycine-N-methyl transferase generates sarcosine from glycine. Sarcosine is a natural amino acid found in muscles and other body tissues. In the laboratory it may be synthesized from chloroacetic acid and methylamine. Sarcosine is naturally found in the metabolism of choline to glycine. Sarcosine is sweet to the taste and dissolves in water. It is used in manufacturing biodegradable surfactants and toothpastes as well as in other applications. Sarcosine is ubiquitous in biological materials and is present in such foods as egg yolks, turkey, ham, vegetables, legumes, etc. Sarcosine is formed from dietary intake of choline and from the metabolism of methionine, and is rapidly degraded to glycine. Sarcosine has no known toxicity, as evidenced by the lack of phenotypic manifestations of sarcosinemia, an inborn error of sarcosine metabolism. Sarcosinemia can result from severe folate deficiency because of the folate requirement for the conversion of sarcosine to glycine (Wikipedia). Sarcosine has recently been identified as a biomarker for invasive prostate cancer. It was found to be greatly increased during prostate cancer progression to metastasis and could be detected in urine. Sarcosine levels were also increased in invasive prostate cancer cell lines relative to benign prostate epithelial cells (PMID: 19212411).↵",HMDB0000271,CNCC(O)=O,C3H7NO2,"1S/C3H7NO2/c1-4-2-3(5)6/h4H,2H2,1H3,(H,5,6)",FSYKKLYZXJSNPZ-UHFFFAOYSA-N,2-(methylamino)acetic acid,-3.1862609543807587,,89.0932,89.047678473,3.08e+02 g/l,-3.06,0.54,3,2,2,49.33,20.778,8.659577131531222,sarcosine,0,0,10.345946235601334,2.056675239103723,1,0,1,0,0,0,MDB00000177,"5170,5171,5183,5313,5402,5499,5500"
139,Phosphoserine,"Phosphoserine is the phosphoric acid ester of the amino acid serine. It is found in essentially all living organisms ranging from microbes to plants to mammals. Phosphoserine is a component of many proteins as the result of posttranslational modifications to the native protein‚Äôs serine residue(s). The phosphorylation of the hydroxyl functional group in serine to produce phosphoserine is catalyzed by various types of kinases. Serine is one of three amino acid residues that are commonly phosphorylated by kinases during cell signalling in eukaryotes. Free phosphoserine is found in many biofluids and likely arises from the proteolysis of proteins containing phosphoserine residues (PMID: 7693088 ). Phosphoserine as a disease biomarker has shown to be associated with eosinophilic esophagitis, a chronic, allergic inflammatory disease of the esophagus that occurs when a type of white blood cell, the eosinophil, accumulates in the esophagus. This elevated number of eosinophils causes injury and inflammation to the esophagus. Literature has shown the elevated presence of Phosphoserine in blood, cerebrospinal fluid and in urine. Specifically, unpublished NMR work on 30 paediatric urine samples has reported that  in children (1-13 years old) with eosinophilic Esophagitis, phosphoserine is shown to be significantly elevated in the urine at a concentration of 146.693 +/- 9.722 μmol/mmol creatinine compared to normal children at a concentration of 59.051 +/- 21.239 μmol/mmol creatinine.",HMDB0000272,N[C@@H](COP(O)(O)=O)C(O)=O,C3H8NO6P,"1S/C3H8NO6P/c4-2(3(5)6)1-10-11(7,8)9/h2H,1,4H2,(H,5,6)(H2,7,8,9)/t2-/m0/s1",BZQFBWGGLXLEPQ-REOHCLBHSA-N,(2S)-2-amino-3-(phosphonooxy)propanoic acid,-3.180275047030002,2.066741968210883,185.0725,185.008923505,1.99e+01 g/l,-2.32,-0.97,6,4,4,130.08,32.9139,13.968826440672615,phosphoserine,0,-2,9.39423622748354,1.1985006020847058,1,0,1,0,0,0,MDB00000178,5313
140,Thymidine,"Thymidine, also known as deoxythymidine or deoxyribosylthymine or thymine deoxyriboside, is a pyrimidine deoxynucleoside. It consists of the nucleobae thymine attached to deoxyribose through a beta N- glycosidic bond. Deoxythymidine is the DNA nucleoside T, which pairs with deoxyadenosine (A) in double-stranded DNA. Therefore, thymidine is essential to all life. Deoxythymidine can be phosphorylated with one, two or three phosphoric acid groups, creating dTMP (deoxythymidine monophosphate), dTDP, or dTTP (for the di- and tri- phosphates, respectively). dTMP can be incorporated into DNA via DNA polymerases. Derivatives of thymidine are used in a number of drugs, including Azidothymidine (AZT), which is used in the treatment of HIV infection.

141,D-Ribose,"D-ribose, commonly referred to simply as ribose, is a five-carbon sugar found in all living cells. Ribose is not an essential nutrient because it can be synthesized by almost every tissue in the body from other substances, such as glucose. It is vital for life as a component of DNA, RNA, ATP, ADP, and AMP. In nature, small amounts of ribose can be found in ripe fruits and vegetables. Brewer's yeast, which has a high concentration of RNA, is another rich source of ribose. D-ribose is also a component of many so-called energy drinks and antiaging products available on the market today. Ribose is a structural component of ATP, which is the primary energy source for exercising muscle. The adenosine component is an adenine base attached to the five-carbon sugar ribose. ATP provides energy to working muscles by releasing a phosphate group, hence becoming ADP, which in turn may release a phosphate group, then becoming AMP. During intense muscular activity, the total amount of ATP available is quickly depleted. In an effort to correct this imbalance, AMP is broken down in the muscle and secreted from the cell. Once the breakdown products of AMP are released from the cell, the energy potential (TAN pool) of the muscle is reduced and ATP must then be reformed using ribose. Ribose helps restore the level of adenine nucleotides by bypassing the rate-limiting step in the de novo (oxidative pentose phosphate) pathway, which regenerates 5-phosphoribosyl-l-pyrophosphate (PRPP), the essential precursor for ATP. If ribose is not readily available to a cell, glucose may be converted to ribose. Ribose supplementation has been shown to increase the rate of ATP resynthesis following intense exercise. The use of ribose in men with severe coronary artery disease resulted in improved exercise tolerance. Hence, there is interest in the potential of ribose supplements to boost muscular performance in athletic activities.

143,Uric acid,"Uric acid is a heterocyclic purine derivative that is the final oxidation product of purine metabolism. It is a weak acid distributed throughout the extracellular fluid as sodium urate. Uric acid is produced by the enzyme xanthine oxidase, which oxidizes oxypurines such as xanthine into uric acid. In most mammals, except humans and higher primates, the enzyme uricase further oxidizes uric acid to allantoin. Interestingly, during the Miocene epoch (~15-20 million years ago), two distinct mutations in the primate genome occurred that led to a nonfunctioning uricase gene. Consequently, humans, apes, and certain New World monkeys have much higher uric acid levels (>120 μM) compared with other mammals (<<120 uM). The loss of uricase in higher primates parallels the similar loss of the ability to synthesize ascorbic acid vitamin C. This may be because in higher primates uric acid partially replaces ascorbic acid. Like ascorbic acid, uric acid is an antioxidant. In fact, in primates, uric acid is the major antioxidant in serum and is thought to be a major factor in lengthening life-span and decreasing age-specific cancer rates in humans and other primates (PMID: 6947260 ). Uric acid is also the end product of nitrogen metabolism in birds and reptiles. In these animal species, it is excreted in feces as a dry mass. In humans and other mammals, the amount of urate in the blood depends on the dietary intake of purines, the level of endogenous urate biosynthesis, and the rate of urate excretion. Several kidney urate transporters are involved in the regulation of plasma urate levels. These include the urate transporter 1 (URAT1), which controls the reabsorption of urate as well as a number of organic ion transporters (OAT), such as OAT1 and OAT3, and the ATP-dependent urate export transporter MRP4. URAT1 is believed to be most critical in the regulation of plasma urate levels. (PMID: 17890445 ) High levels of plasma uric acid lead to a condition called hyperuricemia while low levels are associated with a condition called hypouricemia. Hyperuricemia has been defined as a uric acid concentration greater than 380 μM, while hypouricemia is generally defined as a urate concentration of less than 120 μM. Hyperuricemia can arise from a number of factors, including both acute and chronic causes. Acute causes of hyperuricemia include the intake of large amounts of alcohol, tumor lysis syndrome and a diet that is rich in purines or proteins. Chronic hyperuricemia can arise from a reduction in the kidney’s glomerular filtration rate, a decrease in the excretion of urate or an increase in overall tubular absorption in the kidneys. Hyperuricemia has been linked to a number of diseases and conditions, including gout, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, and renal disease. Uric acid has been identified as a uremic toxin according to the European Uremic Toxin Working Group (PMID: 22626821 ). Uremic toxins are compounds that are normally secreted by the kidney that interact negatively with normal biological functions. Many of the causes of hyperuricemia are correctable either with lifestyle changes or drugs. Lifestyle changes include reducing weight and reducing the consumption of protein, purines, and alcohol. There are two kinds of drugs that can be used to treat chronic hyperuricemia. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors, such as allopurinol, inhibit the production of urate by blocking urate synthesis. Alternately, uricosuric drugs, such as probenecid, sulfinpyrazone, and benzbromarone, are used to reduce the serum urate concentration through the inhibition of the URAT1 transporter. (PMID: 17890445 ). Uric acid (especially crystalline uric acid) is also thought to be an essential initiator and amplifier of allergic inflammation for asthma and peanut allergies (PMID: 21474346). Uric acid is also associated with Canavan Disease where adults (>18 years old) with the disease have elevated levels of uric acid in the urine at a concentration of 1554.14 +/- 748.85 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 16139832) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 209.55 +/- 104.52 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 16139832). A similar trend is observed in all age groups (PMID: 16139832). Uric acid is also identified as a biomarker in individuals with xanthinuria type 1. Adults (>18 years old) with xanthinuria type 1 have shown significantly reduced levels of uric acid in the blood at a concentration <10 μM (PMID: 23249873) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 200-420 μM (PMID: 23249873). Uric acid has also been associated with molybdenum cofactor deficiency,  a rare condition characterised by brain dysfunction (encephalopathy) that worsens over time. In children (1-13 years old) with molybdenum cofactor deficiency, uric acid is found to be significantly reduced in the urine at a concentration of 5 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 8051926) compared to normal children at a concentration of 2210.4 (218.8-4202.0) (GeneReviews).",HMDB0000289,O=C1NC2=C(N1)C(=O)NC(=O)N2,C5H4N4O3,"1S/C5H4N4O3/c10-3-1-2(7-4(11)6-1)8-5(12)9-3/h(H4,6,7,8,9,10,11,12)",LEHOTFFKMJEONL-UHFFFAOYSA-N,"2,3,6,7,8,9-hexahydro-1H-purine-2,6,8-trione",-1.5441929356666664,8.972761778718843,168.1103,168.028340014,1.76e+00 g/l,-1.12,-1.98,3,4,0,99.33000000000001,45.62859999999999,13.613230919300054,uric acid,0,0,-6.523072814060841,7.246926773305706,1,2,1,0,0,0,MDB00000185,"5174,5175,5179,5191,5192,5200,5230,5241,5244,5275,5276,5280,5281,5286,5320,5388,5389,5410,5419,5420,5443,5458,5479,5480,5491,5524,5539"
144,Vanillylmandelic acid,"Vanillylmandelic acid, also known as vanillylmandelate or VMA, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as methoxyphenols. Methoxyphenols are compounds containing a methoxy group attached to the benzene ring of a phenol moiety. Vanillylmandelic acid is a sweet and vanilla tasting compound. Vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) is a chemical intermediate in the synthesis of artificial vanilla flavorings and is an end-stage metabolite of the catecholamines (dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine). Vanillylmandelic acid exists in all living organisms, ranging from bacteria to plants to humans. Within humans, vanillylmandelic acid participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, vanillylmandelic acid can be biosynthesized from 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycolaldehyde through its interaction with the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase. In addition, vanillylmandelic acid and pyrocatechol can be biosynthesized from 3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid and guaiacol through the action of the enzyme catechol O-methyltransferase. Urinary VMA is elevated in patients with tumors that secrete catecholamines. Urinary VMA tests may also be used to diagnose neuroblastomas, and to monitor treatment of these conditions. VMA urinalysis tests can be used to diagnose an adrenal gland tumor called pheochromocytoma, a tumor of catecholamine-secreting chromaffin cells. Vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) is produced in the liver and is a major product of norepinephrine and epinephrine metabolism excreted in the urine. Vanillylmandelic acid is associated with Aromatic L Amino Acid Decarboxylase Deficiency where children (1-13 years old) with the deficiency have shown reduced levels of vanillylmandelic acid in the urine at a concentration of 0.5 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 9686366) compared to normal children at a concentration of 0.300-19.700 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 9686366). Vanillylmandelic acid is also associated with Brunner Syndrome, a rare genetic disorder associated with a mutation in the MAOA gene and is an X-linked recessive disorders that manifests in males. In adult males (>18 years old) with Brunner Syndrome, vanillylmandelic acid is reduced in the urine at a concentration of 0.2-0.4 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 8503438) compared to normal adult males at a concentration of 0.5-7.6 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 8503438). Additionally, vanillylmandelic acid is also shown to be associated with phenylketonuria where children (1-13 years old) with the disorder have elevated levels of vanillylmandelic acid at a concentration of 15.404 +/- 14.833 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 4837567) compared to normal children at a concentration of 4.906 +/- 1.769 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 4837567).",HMDB0000291,COC1=C(O)C=CC(=C1)[C@H](O)C(O)=O,C9H10O5,"1S/C9H10O5/c1-14-7-4-5(2-3-6(7)10)8(11)9(12)13/h2-4,8,10-11H,1H3,(H,12,13)/t8-/m0/s1",CGQCWMIAEPEHNQ-QMMMGPOBSA-N,(2S)-2-hydroxy-2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)acetic acid,0.43459905733333315,9.913823964089037,198.1727,198.05282343,5.16e+00 g/l,0.94,-1.58,5,3,3,86.99000000000001,47.14790000000001,18.45199272440707,(S)-hydroxy(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)acetic acid,0,-1,-4.128024057113833,3.113631257291667,1,1,1,1,0,0,MDB00000186,"5177,5303,5371"
145,Xanthine,"Xanthine, also known as 2,6-dioxopurine, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as xanthines. These are purine derivatives with a ketone group conjugated at carbons 2 and 6 of the purine moiety. Xanthine is also classified as an oxopurine. An oxopurine in which the purine ring is substituted by oxo groups at positions 2 and 6 and N-9 is protonated. Xanthine exists in all living species, ranging from bacteria to plants to humans. In plants, several stimulants can be derived from xanthine, including caffeine, theophylline, and theobromine. Derivatives of xanthine (known collectively as xanthines) are a group of alkaloids commonly used for their effects as mild stimulants and as bronchodilators, notably in the treatment of asthma or influenza symptoms. Within humans, xanthine participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, xanthine can be biosynthesized from guanine; which is mediated by the enzyme guanine deaminase. In addition, xanthine and ribose 1-phosphate can be biosynthesized from xanthosine through the action of the enzyme purine nucleoside phosphorylase. In humans and other primates, xanthine can be converted to uric acid by the action of the xanthine oxidase enzyme. People with rare genetic disorders, specifically xanthinuria and Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, lack sufficient xanthine oxidase and cannot convert xanthine to uric acid. Individuals with xanthinuria have unusually high concentrations of xanthine in their blood and urine, which can lead to health problems such as renal failure and xanthine kidney stones. Individuals with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome have a deficiency of the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT). Specifically, xanthine is found to be significantly elevated in the blood of adults (>18 years old) with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome at a concentration of 2.2 +/- 0.3 μM (PMID: 3148065) compared to normal adults at a concentration of <2 μM (PMID: 3148065). The HGPRT deficiency causes a build-up of uric acid in all body fluids. This results in both high levels of uric acid in the blood and urine, associated with severe gout and kidney problems.

146,Urea,"Urea is a highly soluble organic compound formed in the liver from ammonia produced by the deamination of amino acids. It is the principal end product of protein catabolism and constitutes about one half of the total urinary solids. Urea is formed in a cyclic pathway known simply as the urea cycle. In this cycle, amino groups donated by ammonia and L-aspartate are converted to urea. Urea is essentially a waste product; it has no physiological function. It is dissolved in blood (in humans in a concentration of 2.5 - 7.5 mmol/liter) and excreted by the kidney in the urine. In addition, a small amount of urea is excreted (along with sodium chloride and water) in human sweat.↵Urea is a known uremic toxin.

147,Uracil,"Uracil, also known as U, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as pyrimidones. Pyrimidones are compounds that contain a pyrimidine ring, which bears a ketone. Pyrimidine is a 6-membered ring consisting of four carbon atoms and two nitrogen centers at the 1- and 3- ring positions. Uracil is a common naturally occurring pyrimidine found in RNA. It base pairs with adenine and is replaced by thymine in DNA. Uracil is one of the four nucleobases in RNA that are represented by the letters A, G, C and U. Methylation of uracil produces thymine. The name ""uracil"" was coined in 1885 by the German chemist Robert Behrend, who was attempting to synthesize derivatives of uric acid. Originally discovered in 1900, uracil was isolated by hydrolysis of yeast nuclein that was found in bovine thymus and spleen, herring sperm, and wheat germ. Uracil exists in all living species, ranging from bacteria to plants to humans. Uracil's use in the body is to help carry out the synthesis of many enzymes necessary for cell function through bonding with riboses and phosphates. Uracil serves as an allosteric regulator and a coenzyme for many important biochemical reactions. Uracil (via the nucleoside uridine) can be phosphorylated by various kinases to produce UMP, UDP and UTP. UDP and UTP regulate carbamoyl phosphate synthetase II (CPSase II) activity in animals. Uracil is also involved in the biosynthesis of polysaccharides and in the transport of sugars containing aldehydes. Within humans, uracil participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, uracil and ribose 1-phosphate can be biosynthesized from uridine; which is mediated by the enzyme uridine phosphorylase 2. In addition, uracil can be converted into dihydrouracil through the action of the enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase [NADP(+)]. Uracil is rarely found in DNA, and this may have been an evolutionary change to increase genetic stability. This is because cytosine can deaminate spontaneously to produce uracil through hydrolytic deamination. Therefore, if there were an organism that used uracil in its DNA, the deamination of cytosine (which undergoes base pairing with guanine) would lead to formation of uracil (which would base pair with adenine) during DNA synthesis. Uracil can be used for drug delivery and as a pharmaceutical. When elemental fluorine reacts with uracil, it produces 5-fluorouracil. 5-Fluorouracil is an anticancer drug (antimetabolite) that mimics uracil during the nucleic acid (i.e. RNA) synthesis and transcription process. Because 5-fluorouracil is similar in shape to, but does not undergo the same chemistry as, uracil, the drug inhibits RNA replication enzymes, thereby blocking RNA synthesis and stopping the growth of cancerous cells. Uracil is associated with Canavan disease where adults (>18 years old) with the disease have shown elevated levels of uracil in the blood at a concentration of 2.25 +/- 0.98 μM (PMID: 16139832) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 2.10 +/- 1.02 μM (PMID: 16139832). Uracil has also shown to be associated with uremia where children (3 months - 6 years old) have shown elevated levels of uracil in the blood at a concentration of 2.250 +/- 1.380 μM (PMID: 12675874) compared to normal children at a concentration <2 μM (PMID: 12675874). Similarly, uracil is associated with argenemia where children (1-13 years old) have shown elevated levels of uracil in the urine at a concentration of 144.265 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 2311630) compared to normal children at a concentration of  43.0 (8.0-78.0) μmol/mmol creatinine (BC Children’s Hospital). Uracil is also found to be significantly elevated in the urine of adults (>18 years old) with dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency at a concentration of 495.881 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 2109146) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 7.914-33.918 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 2019146).",HMDB0000300,O=C1NC=CC(=O)N1,C4H4N2O2,"1S/C4H4N2O2/c7-3-1-2-5-4(8)6-3/h1-2H,(H2,5,6,7,8)",ISAKRJDGNUQOIC-UHFFFAOYSA-N,"1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrimidine-2,4-dione",-0.8552909999999998,13.756677870062841,112.0868,112.027277382,2.65e+01 g/l,-1.20,-0.63,2,2,0,58.2,25.9693,9.36551055096874,uracil,0,0,-5.5116186106121114,8.803392786213806,1,1,1,0,0,0,MDB00000192,"5174,5296,5315,5412,5419,5437"
148,Urocanic acid,"Urocanic acid or urocanate is a breakdown (deamination) product of histidine. In the liver, urocanic acid is an intermediate in the conversion of histidine to glutamic acid, whereas in the epidermis, it accumulates and may be both a UV protectant and an immunoregulator. Urocanic acid (UA) exists as a trans isomer (t-UA, approximately 30 mg/cm2) in the uppermost layer of the skin (stratum corneum). t-UA is formed as the cells of the second layer of skin become metabolically inactive. During this process, proteins and membranes degrade, histidine is released, and histidase (histidine ammonia lyase) catalyzes the deamination of histidine to form t-UA. t-UA accumulates in the epidermis until removal by either the monthly skin renewal cycle or sweat. Upon absorption of UV light, the naturally occurring t-UA isomerizes to its cis form, c-UA. Because DNA lesions (e.g., pyrimidine dimers) in the lower epidermis can result from UV-B absorption, initial research proposed that t-UA acted as a natural sunscreen absorbing UV-B in the stratum corneum before the damaging rays could penetrate into lower epidermal zones. Researchers have found that c-UA also suppresses contact hypersensitivity and delayed hypersensitivity, reduces the Langerhans cell count in the epidermis, prolongs skin-graft survival time, and affects natural killer cell activity",HMDB0000301,OC(=O)\C=C\C1=CNC=N1,C6H6N2O2,"1S/C6H6N2O2/c9-6(10)2-1-5-3-7-4-8-5/h1-4H,(H,7,8)(H,9,10)/b2-1+",LOIYMIARKYCTBW-OWOJBTEDSA-N,(2E)-3-(1H-imidazol-4-yl)prop-2-enoic acid,-1.0052561452921183,13.886392712824712,138.124,138.042927446,4.25e+01 g/l,0.22,-0.51,3,2,2,65.97999999999999,35.5676,13.09524481706865,trans-urocanic acid,0,-1,6.13318975489442,3.8470756665411976,1,1,1,0,0,0,MDB00000193,

Hydrolysis of retinyl esters results in retinol while pro-vitamin A carotenoids can be cleaved to produce retinal. Retinal, also known as retinaldehyde, can be reversibly reduced to produce retinol or it can be irreversibly oxidized to produce retinoic acid. Retinol and derivatives of retinol that play an essential role in metabolic functioning of the retina, the growth of and differentiation of epithelial tissue, the growth of bone, reproduction, and the immune response.

A large dietary intake of tyramine can cause an increase in systolic blood pressure of 30 mmHg or more. Tyramine acts as a neurotransmitter via a G protein-coupled receptor with high affinity for tyramine called TA1. The TA1 receptor is found in the brain as well as peripheral tissues including the kidney.

153,2-Hydroxyadipic acid,"2-Hydroxyadipic acid is a hydroxy-dicarboxylic acid formed by the reduction of 2-ketoadipic acid. A deficiency of 2-ketoadipic dehydrogenase causes 2-ketoadipic acidemia or 2-oxoadipic acidemia (OMIM: 245130 ), a genetic disorder characterized by accumulation and excretion of 2-hydroxyadipic acid (with 2-ketoadipic and 2-aminoadipic) (OMMBID - The Online Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease, CH.95). A method involving derivatization and combined gas chromatography--mass spectrometry has been recently developed to separate the enantiomers of 3-hydroxyadipic acid (PMID: 3980660). It has been shown that 3-hydroxyadipic acid excreted in urine consists of at least 95% of the L-enantiomer. This finding supports the hypothesis that dicarboxylic acids are degraded by ordinary beta-oxidation, and indicates that adipic acid may be converted into succinic acid. (PMID: 3980660). When present in sufficiently high levels, 2-hydroxyadipic acid can act as an acidogen and a metabotoxin. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of 2-hydroxyadipic acid are associated with at least three inborn errors of metabolism including 2-oxoadipic acidemia, 2-aminoadipic aciduria, and 2-oxoadipic aciduria. 2-Hydroxyadipic acid is an organic acid. Specifically, in children (1-13 years old) with 2-Ketoadipic Acidemia, 2-Hydroxyadipic acid is significantly elevated in the urine at a concentration of 135.0 (50.0-220.0) umol/mmol creatinine (MetaGene) compared to normal individuals at a concentration of 2.2 (0.1-6.8) umol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 8087979). Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart abnormalities, kidney abnormalities, liver damage, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of the untreated IEMs mentioned above. Many affected children with organic acidemias experience intellectual disability or delayed development. In adults, acidosis or acidemia is characterized by headaches, confusion, feeling tired, tremors, sleepiness, and seizures. 2-Hydroxyadipic acid is also associated with alpha-aminoadipic aciduria where children (1-13 years old) with the disorder have shown significantly elevated levels of 2-Hydroxyadipic acid at a concentration of 80-170 umol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 6796766) compared to normal children at a concentration of 2.2 (0.1-6.8) umol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 8087979).",HMDB0000321,OC(CCCC(O)=O)C(O)=O,C6H10O5,"1S/C6H10O5/c7-4(6(10)11)2-1-3-5(8)9/h4,7H,1-3H2,(H,8,9)(H,10,11)",OTTXIFWBPRRYOG-UHFFFAOYSA-N,2-hydroxyhexanedioic acid,-0.3804115579999999,4.304936769181927,162.1406,162.05282343,7.03e+01 g/l,-0.79,-0.36,5,3,5,94.82999999999998,34.2312,14.876466136336678,α-hydroxyadipic acid,0,-2,-3.7978986375206967,3.435316368213932,1,0,1,0,0,0,MDB00000200,"5368,5470"

156,2-Methylbutyrylglycine,"2-Methylbutyrylglycine is an acyl glycine. Acyl glycines are normally minor metabolites of fatty acids. However, the excretion of certain acyl glycines is increased in several inborn errors of metabolism. In certain cases the measurement of these metabolites in body fluids can be used to diagnose disorders associated with mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation. Acyl glycines are produced through the action of glycine N-acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.13) which is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction: acyl-CoA + glycine < -- > CoA + N-acylglycine. The isolated excretion of 2-methylbutyrylglycine (2-MBG) is the hallmark of short/branched-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (PubMedID 15615815).

161,17a-Hydroxypregnenolone,"17a-Hydroxypregnenolone is a 21-carbon steroid that is converted from pregnenolone by cytochrome P450 17alpha hydroxylase/C17,20 lyase (CYP17, EC 1.14.99.9). 17a-Hydroxypregnenolone is an intermediate in the delta-5 pathway of biosynthesis of gonadal steroid hormones and the adrenal corticosteroids. The first, rate-limiting and hormonally regulated step in the biosynthesis of all steroid hormones is the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone. The conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone is accomplished by the cleavage of the cholesterol side chain, catalyzed by a mitochondrial cytochrome P450 enzyme termed P450scc where scc designates Side Chain Cleavage. All steroid hormones are made from the pregnenolone produced by P450scc; thus, the presence or absence of each of the activities of CYP17 directs this pregnenolone towards its final metabolic pathway. While all cytochrome P450 enzymes can catalyze multiple reactions on a single active site, CYP17 is the only one described to date in which these multiple activities are differentially regulated by a physiologic process. 17a-Hydroxypregnenolone is converted to dehydroepiandrosterone by the 17,20 lyase activity of CYP17. The ratio of the 17,20 lyase to 17 alpha-hydroxylase activity of CYP17 determines the ratio of C21 to C19 steroids produced. This ratio is regulated post-translationally by at least three factors: the abundance of the electron-donating protein P450 oxidoreductase, the presence of cytochrome b5, and the serine phosphorylation of CYP17.

162,17-Hydroxyprogesterone,"17-Hydroxyprogesterone serves as an intermediate in the biosynthesis of hydrocortisone and gonadal steroid hormones.

Normal levels are 3-90 ng/dl in children, and in women, 15-70 ng/dl prior to ovulation, and 35-290 ng/dl during the luteal phase. - Measurements of levels of 17-hydroxyprogesterone are useful in the evaluation of patients with suspected congenital adrenal hyperplasia as the typical enzymes that are defective, namely 21-hydroxylase and 11&#946;-hydroxylase, lead to a build-up of 17OHP. In contrast, the rare patient with 17&#945;-hydroxylase deficiency will have very low or undetectable levels of 17OHP. 17OHP levels can also be used to measure contribution of progestational activity of the corpus luteum during pregnancy as progesterone but not 17OHP is also contributed by the placenta.↵",HMDB0000374,[H][C@@]12CC[C@](O)(C(C)=O)[C@@]1(C)CC[C@@]1([H])[C@@]2([H])CCC2=CC(=O)CC[C@]12C,C21H30O3,"1S/C21H30O3/c1-13(22)21(24)11-8-18-16-5-4-14-12-15(23)6-9-19(14,2)17(16)7-10-20(18,21)3/h12,16-18,24H,4-11H2,1-3H3/t16-,17+,18+,19+,20+,21+/m1/s1",DBPWSSGDRRHUNT-CEGNMAFCSA-N,"(1S,2R,10R,11S,14R,15S)-14-acetyl-14-hydroxy-2,15-dimethyltetracyclo[8.7.0.0^{2,7}.0^{11,15}]heptadec-6-en-5-one",3.4011792776666674,17.598886675440433,330.4611,330.219494826,2.93e-02 g/l,2.99,-4.05,3,1,1,54.370000000000005,94.10529999999997,37.895190581319426,"(1S,2R,10R,11S,14R,15S)-14-acetyl-14-hydroxy-2,15-dimethyltetracyclo[8.7.0.0^{2,7}.0^{11,15}]heptadec-6-en-5-one",0,0,-3.8049652826185154,12.699646444874293,1,4,1,1,0,0,MDB00000222,"5178,5193,5355,5356,5357,5403,5404,5415,5465,5466"

168,3-Hydroxyglutaric acid,"3-Hydroxyglutaric acid is a member of the class of compounds known as dicarboxylic acids and derivatives. These are organic compounds containing exactly two carboxylic acid groups. 3-Hydroxyglutaric acid is soluble (in water) and a weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). When present in sufficiently high levels, 3-hydroxyglutaric acid can act as an acidogen and a metabotoxin. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of 3-hydroxyglutaric acid are associated with glutaric aciduria type I (glutaric acidemia type I, glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, GA1, or GAT1). GA1 is an inherited disorder in which the body is unable to completely break down the amino acids lysine, hydroxylysine, and tryptophan due to a deficiency of mitochondrial glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.99.7, GCDH). Excessive levels of their intermediate breakdown products (e.g. glutaric acid, glutaryl-CoA, 3-hydroxyglutaric acid, glutaconic acid) can accumulate and cause damage to the brain (and also other organs), but particularly the basal ganglia. GA1 is associated with a risk for intracranial and retinal hemorrhage, and non-specific white matter changes. Babies with glutaric acidemia type I are often born with unusually large heads (macrocephaly). Other symptoms include spasticity (increased muscle tone/stiffness) and dystonia (involuntary muscle contractions resulting in abnormal movement or posture), but many affected individuals are asymptomatic. Seizures and coma (encephalopathy) are rare.

170,Adipic acid,"Adipic acid is an important industrial dicarboxylic acid with about 2.5 billion kilograms produced per year. It is used mainly in the production of nylon. It occurs relatively rarely in nature. It has a tart taste and is also used as an additive and gelling agent in jello or gelatins. It is also used in some calcium carbonate antacids to make them tart. Adipic acid has also been incorporated into controlled-release formulation matrix tablets to obtain pH-independent release for both weakly basic and weakly acidic drugs. Adipic acid in the urine and in the blood is typically exogenous in origin and is a good biomarker of jello consumption. In fact, a condition known as adipic aciduria is actually an artifact of jello consumption (PMID: 1779643 ). However, certain disorders (such as diabetes and glutaric aciduria type I.) can lead to elevated levels of adipic acid and other dicarboxylic acids (such as suberic acid) in urine (PMID: 17520433 ; PMID: 6778884 ). Moreover, adipic acid is also found to be associated with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency, carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase deficiency, malonyl-Coa decarboxylase deficiency, and medium Chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, which are inborn errors of metabolism. Adipic acid is also a microbial metabolite found in Escherichia. Adipic acid is associated with colorectal cancer and lung cancer. Literature has not quantified the disease concentration for colorectal cancer (PMID: 27275383). However, in individuals with lung cancer, adipic acid is shown to be elevated in the urine at a concentration of 2.0 (0.0-28.0) μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 18953024) compared to normal individuals at a concentration <15 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 29030856). Adipic acid is also associated with Medium Chain Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency, Malonyl Co A Decarboxylase Deficiency and Carnitine Acylcarnitine Translocase Deficiency. In children (1 - 13 years old) with medium Chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, adipic acid is elevated at a concentration of 44.871 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 2380628) compared to normal children at a concentration of 13.00 +/- 5.4 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 2380628).

173,3-Methylcrotonylglycine,"3-Methylcrotonylglycine is an acyl glycine. Acyl glycines are normally minor metabolites of fatty acids. However, the excretion of certain acyl glycines is increased in several inborn errors of metabolism. In certain cases the measurement of these metabolites in body fluids can be used to diagnose disorders associated with mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation.

175,Calcium,"Calcium is an alkaline earth metal. Calcium is the most abundant metal and the fifth-most abundant element in the human body. It is essential for the normal growth and maintenance of bones and teeth, and calcium requirements must be met throughout life. Requirements are greatest during periods of growth, such as childhood, during pregnancy and when breast-feeding. Long-term calcium deficiency can lead to osteoporosis, in which the bone deteriorates and there is an increased risk of fractures. Adults need between 1,000 and 1,300 mg of calcium in their daily diet. Calcium is essential for living organisms, particularly in cell physiology, and is the most common metal in many animals. Physiologically, it exists as an ion in the body. Calcium combines with phosphorus to form calcium phosphate in the bones and teeth. It is essential for the normal functioning of nerves and muscles and plays a role in blood coagulation (as factor IV) and in many enzymatic processes. Calcium is an important component of a healthy diet. A deficit can affect bone and tooth formation, while overretention can cause kidney stones. Vitamin D is needed to absorb calcium. Dairy products, such as milk and cheese, are a well-known source of calcium. However, some individuals are allergic to dairy products and even more people, particularly those of non-European descent, are lactose-intolerant, leaving them unable to consume dairy products. Fortunately, many other good sources of calcium exist. These include: seaweeds such as kelp, wakame and hijiki; nuts and seeds (like almonds and sesame); beans; amaranth; collard greens; okra; rutabaga; broccoli; kale; and fortified products such as orange juice and soy milk.

176,Biopterin,"Biopterin concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid from patients with Parkinson's disease, in which the nigrostriatal dopamine neurons degenerate, are lower than those from age-matched older controls. In hereditary progressive dystonia/DOPA-responsive dystonia, which is a dopamine deficiency caused by mutations in GTP cyclohydrolase I without neuronal cell death (Segawa's disease), biopterin in cerebrospinal fluid decrease in parallel owing to the decreased activity in GTP cyclohydrolase I (EC 3.5.4.16, is an enzyme that is part of the folate and biopterin biosynthesis pathways. It is responsible for the hydrolysis of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to form 7,8-dihydroneopterin 3'-triphosphate. (Pteridines (1999), 10(1), 5-13.) Lowered levels of urinary biopterin concomitant with elevated serum phenylalanine concentration occur in a variant type of hyperphenylalaninemia caused by a deficiency of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), the obligatory cofactor for phenylalanine hydroxylase. The most frequent form of this cofactor deficiency is due to lack of 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS) activity, the second enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway for BH4. (PMID 8178819) The hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylating system consists of 3 essential components, phenylalanine hydroxylase, dihydropteridine reductase, and the nonprotein coenzyme, tetrahydrobiopterin. The reductase and the pterin coenzyme are also essential components of the tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylating systems. There are 3 distinct forms of phenylketonuria or hyperphenylalaninemia, each caused by lack of 1 of these essential components. The variant forms of the disease that are caused by the lack of dihydropteridine reductase or tetrahydrobiopterin are characterized by severe neurol. deterioration, impaired functioning of tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylases, and the resultant deficiency of tyrosine- and tryptophan-derived monoamine neurotransmitters in brain.

177,5-Hydroxy-L-tryptophan,"5-Hydroxy-L-tryptophan is an aromatic amino acid naturally produced by the body from the essential amino acid l-tryptophan. 5-Hydroxy-L-tryptophan is the immediate precursor of the neurotransmitter serotonin. The conversion to serotonin is catalyzed by the enzyme aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.28, AADC1 also known as dopa decarboxylase), an essential enzyme in the metabolism of the monoamine neurotransmitters. An accumulation of 5-Hydroxy-L-tryptophan in cerebrospinal fluid occurs in Aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency (OMIM 608643), accompanied by an increased excretion in the urine of the patients, which are indicative of the disorder but not specific 5-Hydroxy-L-tryptophan is also increased in other disorders such as in Parkinson's patients with severe postural instability and gait disorders. Confirmation of the diagnosis AADC deficiency is then required by enzyme activity measurement or genetic analysis. The amount of endogenous 5-Hydroxy-L-tryptophan available for serotonin synthesis depends on the availability of tryptophan and on the activity of various enzymes, especially tryptophan hydroxylase (EC 1.14.16.4), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.52), and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase. (EC 1.13.11.11, TDO). 5-Hydroxy-L-tryptophan has been used clinically for over 30 years. In addition to depression, the therapeutic administration of 5-Hydroxy-L-tryptophan has been shown to be effective in treating a wide variety of conditions, including fibromyalgia, insomnia, binge eating associated with obesity, cerebellar ataxia, and chronic headaches. 5-Hydroxy-L-tryptophan easily crosses the blood-brain barrier and effectively increases central nervous system (CNS) synthesis of serotonin. Supplementation with 5-Hydroxy-L-tryptophan is hypothesized to normalize serotonin synthesis, which is putatively related to its antidepressant properties.

178,3-Methylhistidine,"3-Methylhistidine, also known as 3-MHis or 3MH, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as histidine and derivatives. Histidine and derivatives are compounds containing cysteine or a derivative thereof resulting from reaction of cysteine at the amino group or the carboxy group, or from the replacement of any hydrogen of glycine by a heteroatom. 3-Methylhistidine is a very strong basic compound (based on its pKa). It is also classified as a methylamino acid. It is also a biomarker for the consumption of soy products. Methylamino acids are primarily proteogenic amino acids (found in proteins) which have been methylated (in situ) on their side chains by various methyltransferase enzymes. 3-Methylhistidine is also classified as a member of the class of compounds known as L-alpha-amino acids. L-alpha-Amino acids are alpha amino acids which have the L-configuration of the alpha-carbon atom. Amino acids are organic compounds that contain amino (-NH2) and carboxyl (-COOH) functional groups, along with a side chain (R group) specific to each amino acid. 3-Methylhistidine is generated from histidine residues found in proteins. Histidine can be methylated at either the N1 or N3 position of its imidazole ring, yielding the isomers 1-methylhistidine (1MH; also referred to as pi-methylhistidine) or 3-methylhistidine (3MH; tau-methylhistidine), respectively. There is considerable confusion with regard to the nomenclature of the methylated nitrogen atoms on the imidazole ring of histidine and other histidine-containing peptides such as anserine. In particular, older literature (mostly prior to the year 2000) designated anserine (Npi methylated) as beta-alanyl-N1-methyl-histidine, whereas according to standard IUPAC nomenclature, anserine is correctly named as beta-alanyl-N3-methyl-histidine. As a result, many papers published prior to the year 2000 incorrectly identified 1MH as a specific marker for dietary consumption or various pathophysiological effects when they really were referring to 3MH (PMID: 24137022). Histidine methylation on the 3- or tau site is mediated by the enzyme known as METTL18. METTL18 is a nuclear methyltransferase protein that contains a functional nuclear localization signal and accumulates in nucleoli. Urinary concentrations of 3-methylhistidine can be used as a biomarker for skeletal muscle protein breakdown in humans who have been subject to muscle injury (PMID: 16079625 ). 3-methylhistidine is formed by the posttranslational methylation of histidine residues of the main myofibrillar proteins actin and myosin. The measurement of 3-methylhistidine provides an index of the rate of muscle protein breakdown. 3-Methylhistidine is a biomarker for meat consumption, especially chicken.During protein catabolism, 3-methylhistidine is released but cannot be reutilized. Therefore, the plasma concentration and urine excretion of 3-methylhistidine are sensitive markers of myofibrillar protein degradation (PMID: 32235743). Approximately 75% of 3-methylhistidine is estimated to originate from skeletal muscle (PMID: 32235743). In addition to the degradation of muscle proteins, the 3-methylhistidine level is affected by the degradation of intestinal proteins and meat intake. 3-Methylhistidine exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. In humans, 3-methylhistidine is involved in methylhistidine metabolism. 3-Methylhistidine has been found to be associated with several diseases such as diabetes mellitus type 2, eosinophilic esophagitis, and kidney disease. In adults (>18 years old) with diabetes mellitus type 2, the concentration of 3-methylhistidine in urine is elevated at a concentration of 11.6 +/- 6.6 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 15899597) compared to normal adults at a concentrtion of 12.5 +/- 4.2 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 15899597). Similarly, in children (1-13 years old) with eosinophilic escophagitis, 3-methylhistidine in urine is elevated at a concentration of 57.778 +/- 73.153 μmol/mmol creatinine (sourced from unpublished NMR work) compared to normal children at a concentration of 44.944 +/- 41.318 μmol/mmol creatinine (sourced from unpublished NMR work). In adults (>18 years old) with kidney disease, the concentration of 3-methylhistidine in the blood is significantly elevated at a concentration of 23.7 +/- 18.6 μM (PMID: 10838467) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 2.7 (0.0-5.9) μM (PMID: 0721679757). 3-methylhistidine has also been linked to the inborn metabolic disorder propionic acidemia. Specifically, in adults (>18 years old) with propionic acidemia, the concentration of 3-methylhistidine is elevated in the urine at a concentration of 44.5 +/- 1.3 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 19551947) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 16.5 (2.8-59.8) μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 24023812). The overall normal concentration of 3-methylhistidine in the urine of healthy adult humans has been detected and quantified in a range of 3.63-69.27 micromoles per millimole (μmol/mmol) of creatinine, with most studies reporting the average urinary concentration between 15-20 μmol/mmol of creatinine. The average concentration of 3-methylhistidine in human blood plasma has been detected and quantified at 2.85 micromolar (uM) with a range of 0.0-5.9 uM.

Within the cell, aspartylglycosamine is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Moreover, aspartylglycosamine has been found to be associated with aspartylglucosaminuria, which is an inborn error of metabolism.

183,3-Methyl-2-oxovaleric acid,"3-Methyl-2-oxovaleric acid (CAS: 1460-34-0) is an abnormal metabolite that arises from the incomplete breakdown of branched-chain amino acids. It is a metabolite of isoleucine in man, animals and bacteria. It is the alpha-keto acid analogue of isoleucine. 3-Methyl-2-oxovaleric acid is produced from isoleucine by cytosolic branched chain aminotransferase 1 (EC:2.6.1.42), whereupon it is further degraded by branched chain keto acid dehydrogenase E1 to 2-Methyl-1-hydroxybutyl-ThPP. 3-Methyl-2-oxovaleric acid is a neurotoxin, an acidogen, and a metabotoxin. A neurotoxin causes damage to nerve cells and nerve tissues. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of 3-methyl-2-oxovaleric acid are associated with maple syrup urine disease. MSUD is a metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency of the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC), leading to a buildup of the branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) and their toxic by-products (ketoacids) in the blood and urine and causing neurological damage and mental retardation.. The symptoms of MSUD often show in infancy and lead to severe brain damage if untreated. MSUD may also present later depending on the severity of the disease. If left untreated in older individuals, during times of metabolic crisis, symptoms of the condition include uncharacteristically inappropriate, extreme, or erratic behaviour and moods, hallucinations, anorexia, weight loss, anemia, diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, lethargy, oscillating hypertonia and hypotonia, ataxia, seizures, hypoglycemia, ketoacidosis, opisthotonus, pancreatitis, rapid neurological decline, and coma. In maple syrup urine disease, the brain concentration of branched-chain ketoacids can increase 10- to 20-fold. Specifically, in adults (>18 years old) with MSUD, the concentration of 3-Methyl-2-oxovaleric acid is significantly elevated in the urine at a concentration of  209.0 +/- 35.0 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 10472531) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 0.3 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 21388201). Similarly in the blood, the concentration of 3-Methyl-2-oxovaleric acid is also significantly elevated at a concentration of 142.0 +/- 9.0 μM (PMID: 10472531) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 18.0 (8.0-31.0) μM (PMID: 8412012). This increase leads to a depletion of glutamate and a consequent reduction in the concentration of brain glutamine, aspartate, alanine, and other amino acids. The result is a compromise of energy metabolism because of a failure of the malate-aspartate shuttle and a diminished rate of protein synthesis (PMID: 15930465). 3-Methyl-2-oxovaleric acid is a keto-acid, which is a subclass of organic acids. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart, liver, and kidney abnormalities, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of untreated MSUD.

184,Chlorine,"Chlorine is a gas that normally exists as a diatomic molecule. Chlorine is a highly toxic, pale yellow-green gas that has a specific strong smell. In nature, chlorine is most abundant as a chloride ion. In humans, chlorine exists as an anion (Cl-) in the body. The chloride ion is an essential anion that the body needs for many critical functions. It also helps keep the body's acid-base balance. The amount of chloride in the blood is carefully controlled by the kidneys. Chloride ions have important physiological roles. For instance, in the central nervous system, the inhibitory action of glycine and some of the action of GABA relies on the entry of Cl- into specific neurons. Also, the chloride-bicarbonate exchanger biological transport protein relies on the chloride ion to increase the blood's capacity of carbon dioxide, in the form of the bicarbonate ion. Chloride-transporting proteins (CLC) play fundamental roles in many tissues in the plasma membrane as well as in intracellular membranes. CLC proteins form a gene family that comprises nine members in mammals, at least four of which are involved in human genetic diseases. GABA(A) receptors are pentameric complexes that function as ligand-gated chloride ion channels. WNK kinases are a family of serine-threonine kinases that have been shown to play an essential role in the regulation of electrolyte homeostasis, and they are found in diverse epithelia throughout the body that are involved in chloride ion flux. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by alterations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTCR) gene that result in deranged sodium and chloride ion transport channels.

As a metabolite of dihydroxytestosterone formed in the peripheral tissues, androstanediol and androstnediol-glucuronide can be used to estimate peripheral androgen activity. Androstanediol is a potential GABA (A) receptor-modulating neurosteroid with anticonvulsant properties and hence could act as a key neuromodulator in the central nervous system. It is considered that androstanediol has hedonic effects; therefore it is anticipated that androgens that are readily metabolized to androstanediol may have higher abuse potential than androgens that are not as easily metabolized to androstanediol. These results add to the growing literature indicating that athletes and non-athletes may be at considerable risk when they abuse androgens.

187,Aminoadipic acid,"Aminoadipic acid (CAS: 542-32-5), also known as 2-aminoadipate, is a metabolite in the principal biochemical pathway of lysine. It is an intermediate in the metabolism (i.e. breakdown or degradation) of lysine and saccharopine. It antagonizes neuroexcitatory activity modulated by the glutamate receptor N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). Aminoadipic acid has also been shown to inhibit the production of kynurenic acid, a broad spectrum excitatory amino acid receptor antagonist, in brain tissue slices (PMID: 8566117 ). Recent studies have shown that aminoadipic acid is elevated in prostate biopsy tissues from prostate cancer patients (PMID: 23737455 ). Mutations in DHTKD1 (dehydrogenase E1 and transketolase domain-containing protein 1) have been shown to cause human 2-aminoadipic aciduria and 2-oxoadipic aciduria via impaired decarboxylation of 2-oxoadipate to glutaryl-CoA, which is the last step in the lysine degradation pathway (PMID: 23141293 ). Aging, diabetes, sepsis, and renal failure are known to catalyze the oxidation of lysyl residues to form 2-aminoadipic acid in human skin collagen and potentially other tissues (PMID: 18448817 ). Proteolytic breakdown of these tissues can lead to the release of free 2-aminoadipic acid. Studies in rats indicate that aminoadipic acid (along with the three branched-chain amino acids: leucine, valine, and isoleucine) levels are elevated in the pre-diabetic phase and so aminoadipic acid may serve as a predictive biomarker for the development of diabetes (PMID: 15389298 ). Long-term hyperglycemia of endothelial cells can also lead to elevated levels of aminoadipate which is thought to be a sign of lysine breakdown through oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS) (PMID: 21961526 ). 2-Aminoadipate is a potential small-molecule marker of oxidative stress (PMID: 21647514 ). Therefore, depending on the circumstances aminoadipic acid can act as an acidogen, a diabetogen, an atherogen, and a metabotoxin. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A diabetogen is a compound that can lead to type 2 diabetes. An atherogen is a compound that leads to atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of aminoadipic acid are associated with at least two inborn errors of metabolism including 2-aminoadipic aciduria and 2-oxoadipic aciduria. Aminoadipic acid is an organic acid and abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart abnormalities, kidney abnormalities, liver damage, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of the untreated IEMs mentioned above. Many affected children with organic acidemias experience intellectual disability or delayed development. In adults, acidosis or acidemia is characterized by headaches, confusion, feeling tired, tremors, sleepiness, and seizures. As a diabetogen, serum aminoadipic levels appear to regulate glucose homeostasis and have been highly predictive of individuals who later develop diabetes (PMID: 24091325 ). In particular, aminoadipic acid lowers fasting plasma glucose levels and enhances insulin secretion from human islets. As an atherogen, aminoadipic acid has been found to be produced at high levels via protein lysine oxidation in atherosclerotic plaques (PMID: 28069522 ).",HMDB0000510,NC(CCCC(O)=O)C(O)=O,C6H11NO4,"1S/C6H11NO4/c7-4(6(10)11)2-1-3-5(8)9/h4H,1-3,7H2,(H,8,9)(H,10,11)",OYIFNHCXNCRBQI-UHFFFAOYSA-N,(2S)-2-aminohexanedioic acid,-2.799617140954382,4.417593887349678,161.1558,161.068807845,3.27e+01 g/l,-3.43,-0.69,5,3,5,100.62,35.8887,15.528857992657501,aminoadipate,0,-1,9.52703004922271,2.014430671538277,1,0,1,0,0,0,MDB00000273,"5368,5470,5471"
188,L-Arginine,"Arginine (Arg) is an essential amino acid that is physiologically active in the L-form. In mammals, arginine is formally classified as a semiessential or conditionally essential amino acid, depending on the developmental stage and health status of the individual. Infants are unable to effectively synthesize arginine, making it nutritionally essential for infants. Adults, however, are able to synthesize arginine in the urea cycle. Arginine can be considered to be a basic amino acid as the part of the side chain nearest to the backbone is long, carbon-containing and hydrophobic, whereas the end of the side chain is a complex guanidinium group. With a pKa of 12.48, the guanidinium group is positively charged in neutral, acidic and even most basic environments. Because of the conjugation between the double bond and the nitrogen lone pairs, the positive charge is delocalized. This group is able to form multiple H-bonds. L-arginine is an amino acid that has numerous functions in the body. It helps dispose of ammonia, is used to make compounds such as nitric oxide, creatine, L-glutamate, L-proline, and it can be converted to glucose and glycogen if needed. In large doses, L-arginine also stimulates the release of hormones growth hormone and prolactin. Arginine is a known inducer of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) and is responsible for inducing protein synthesis through the mTOR pathway. mTOR inhibition by rapamycin partially reduces arginine-induced protein synthesis PMID: 20841502. Catabolic disease states such as sepsis, injury, and cancer cause an increase in arginine utilization, which can exceed normal body production, leading to arginine depletion. Arginine also activates AMP kinase (AMPK) which then stimulates skeletal muscle fatty acid oxidation and muscle glucose uptake, thereby increasing insulin secretion by pancreatic beta-cells. PMID: 21311355 Arginine is found in plant and animal proteins, such as dairy products, meat, poultry, fish, and nuts.

189,Chenodeoxycholic acid,"Chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA; also known as chenodesoxycholic acid, chenocholic acid and 3α,7α-dihydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oic acid) is a bile acid. It is one of the two primary bile acids in humans. Bile acids are steroid acids found predominantly in bile of mammals. The distinction between different bile acids is minute, depends only on presence or absence of hydroxyl groups on positions 3, 7, and 12. - Bile acids are physiological detergents that facilitate excretion, absorption, and transport of fats and sterols in the intestine and liver. Bile acids are also steroidal amphipathic molecules derived from the catabolism of cholesterol. They modulate bile flow and lipid secretion, are essential for the absorption of dietary fats and vitamins, and have been implicated in the regulation of all the key enzymes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Bile acids recirculate through the liver, bile ducts, small intestine and portal vein to form an enterohepatic circuit. They exist as anions at physiological pH and, consequently, require a carrier for transport across the membranes of the enterohepatic tissues. The unique detergent properties of bile acids are essential for the digestion and intestinal absorption of hydrophobic nutrients. Bile acids have potent toxic properties (e.g., membrane disruption) and there are a plethora of mechanisms to limit their accumulation in blood and tissues. (PMID: 11316487, 16037564, 12576301, 11907135) Usually conjugated with either glycine or taurine bile acids act as a detergent to solubilize fats for intestinal absorption and is reabsorbed by the small intestine.

191,3-Methylglutaconic acid,"3-Methylglutaconic acid is an intermediate (as the CoA thioester) in the leucine degradative pathway as well as the mevalonate shunt, a pathway that links isoprenoid metabolism with mitochondrial acetyl-CoA metabolism (PMID: 7603789 ). 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase is involved in the metabolism process of 3-methylglutaconic acid. 3-Methylglutaconic acid accμMulates in patients with a deficiency of 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase and a large amount of 3-methylglutaconic acid appears in their urine. When present in sufficiently high levels, 3-methylglutaconic acid can act as an acidogen and a metabotoxin. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of 3-methylglutaconic acid are associated with at least five inborn errors of metabolism including 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency, 3-methylglutaconic aciduria type I, 3-methylglutaconic aciduria type III, 3-methylglutaconic aciduria type IV, and guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency (GAMT deficiency). In children (1-13 years old) with 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl-CoA Lyase Deficiency, 3-Methylglutaconic acid is grossly elevated in the urine at a concentration of 4166.4 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 23705938) compared to normal children at a concentration of <6 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 23705938). Similarly, in adults (>18 years old) with 3-methylglutaconic aciduria type I, 3-Methylglutaconic acid is elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid at a concentration of 125 μM (PMID: 16541463) compared to normal adults at a concentration of <10 μM (PMID: 16541463).

Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart, liver, and kidney abnormalities, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of the untreated IEMs mentioned above. Many affected children with organic acidemias experience intellectual disability or delayed development.

194,Adenosine triphosphate,"Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a nucleotide consisting of a purine base (adenine) attached to the first carbon atom of ribose (a pentose sugar). Three phosphate groups are esterified at the fifth carbon atom of the ribose. ATP is incorporated into nucleic acids by polymerases in the processes of DNA replication and transcription. ATP contributes to cellular energy charge and participates in overall energy balance, maintaining cellular homeostasis. ATP can act as an extracellular signaling molecule via interactions with specific purinergic receptors to mediate a wide variety of processes as diverse as neurotransmission, inflammation, apoptosis, and bone remodelling. Extracellular ATP and its metabolite adenosine have also been shown to exert a variety of effects on nearly every cell type in human skin, and ATP seems to play a direct role in triggering skin inflammatory, regenerative, and fibrotic responses to mechanical injury, an indirect role in melanocyte proliferation and apoptosis, and a complex role in Langerhans cell-directed adaptive immunity. During exercise, intracellular homeostasis depends on the matching of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) supply and ATP demand. Metabolites play a useful role in communicating the extent of ATP demand to the metabolic supply pathways Effects as different as proliferation or differentiation, chemotaxis, release of cytokines or lysosomal constituents, and generation of reactive oxygen or nitrogen species are elicited upon stimulation of blood cells with extracellular ATP. The increased concentration of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in erythrocytes from patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) has been observed in many studies but the mechanism leading to these abnormalities still is controversial.

195,Magnesium,"Magnesium salts are essential in nutrition, being required for the activity of many enzymes, especially those concerned with oxidative phosphorylation. Physiologically, it exists as an ion in the body. It is a component of both intra- and extracellular fluids and is excreted in the urine and feces. Deficiency causes irritability of the nervous system with tetany, vasodilatation, convulsions, tremors, depression, and psychotic behaviour. Magnesium ion in large amounts is an ionic laxative, and magnesium sulfate (Epsom salts) is sometimes used for this purpose. So-called ""milk of magnesia"" is a water suspension of one of the few insoluble magnesium compounds, magnesium hydroxide; the undissolved particles give rise to its appearance and name. Milk of magnesia is a mild base, and is commonly used as an antacid. Moreover, magnesium is found to be associated with primary hypomagnesemia, which is an inborn error of metabolism. Hypomagnesemia is an electrolyte disturbance caused when there is a low level of serum magnesium (less than 1.46 mg/dL) in the blood. Hypomagnesemia can be attributed to chronic disease, alcohol use disorder, gastrointestinal losses, renal losses, and other conditions.Magnesium deficiencies (hypomagnesemia) cause tetany, vasodilatation, convulsions, tremors, depression, and psychotic behaviour. Specifically, in adults (>18 years old) with primary hypomagnesemia, magnesium in the blood is decreased at a concentration of 123.431 μM (PMID: 10337938) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 833.0 +/- 208.0 μM (PMID: 16895893).

197,L-Alloisoleucine,"L-alloisoleucine is a branched chain amino acid and a stereo-isomer of L-isoleucine. It is a common constituent of human plasma (albeit at low levels). L-alloisoleucine is produced as a byproduct of isoleucine transamination. L-Isoleucine is one of the four common amino acids (the 3 others being threonine, hydroxyproline, and hydroxylysine) that have two asymmetric carbon atoms which produce four structural possibilities for the same chemical composition. L-alloisoleucine differs from L-isoleucine by having having different stereochemistry around its beta carbon. Plasma L-alloisoleucine, which is derived from L-isoleucine in vivo, can be used for the diagnosis of maple syrup urine disease (MSUD). Indeed, plasma L-alloisoleucine levels above 5 umol/L is the most specific and most sensitive diagnostic marker for all forms of MSUD (PMID: 10508118). In MSUD the degradation of the essential branched-chain L-amino acids leucine, valine, and isoleucine and their derived 2-oxoacids is impaired because of an inherited deficiency in branched-chain 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase complex (EC 1.2.4.4) activity.

198,Creatinine,"Creatinine, or creatine anhydride, is a breakdown product of creatine phosphate in muscle. The loss of a water molecule from creatine results in the formation of creatinine. Creatinine is transferred to the kidneys by blood plasma, whereupon it is eliminated from the body by glomerular filtration and partial tubular excretion. Creatinine is usually produced at a fairly constant rate by the body. Measuring serum creatinine is a simple test and it is the most commonly used indicator of renal function. A rise in blood creatinine levels is observed only with marked damage to functioning nephrons. Therefore, this test is not suitable for detecting early kidney disease. The typical reference range for women is considered about 45-90 µmol/L; for men 60-110 µmol/L. Creatine and creatinine are metabolized in the kidneys, muscle, liver, and pancreas. Creatinine is associated with chronic renal failure and kidney disease where adults (>18 years old) have a significantly elevated  level of creatinine in the blood at a concentration of 440.7 +/- 44.2 μM (PMID: 7296840) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 82.6 +/- 26.2 μM (PMID: 7296840).

199,D-Arabitol,"D-Arabitol or D-Arabinitol is a member of the class of compounds known as sugar alcohols. Sugar alcohols are hydrogenated forms of carbohydrate in which the carbonyl group (aldehyde or ketone reducing sugar) has been reduced to a primary or secondary hydroxyl group. Arabitol exists in two isomers, L-Arabitol and D-Arabitol. D-Arabitol is also classified as a polyol. Polyols are sugar alcohols linked to the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). They are classified on the basis of the number of carbon atoms. Polyols can be detected in a number of body fluids. A defect in the PPP.called ribose-5-phosphate isomerase (RPI) deficiency, is characterized by highly elevated concentrations of the C5 polyols such as D-arabitol in various body fluids. In addition, transaldolase deficiency, another defect in the PPP, is also characterized by increased concentrations of polyols, mainly D-arabitol. So far, the pathophysiological role of polyols is relatively unknown. It is thought that D-arabitol is a metabolic end-product in humans. The mechanisms of brain and neuronal damage in RPI deficiency remain to be elucidated. A neurotoxic effect due to accumulation of the polyols may play a role. D-Arabitol is a product of the enzyme D-arabinitol 4-dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.11). (PMID: 16435225, J Inherit Metab Dis. 2005;28(6):1181-3).

200,Deoxypyridinoline,"Deoxypyridinoline (DPD) is a breakdown product of type I fibrillar collagen, it occurs mainly in Type I collagen of bone. DPD shows a high specificity for bone, and the measurement of urinary DPD is not influenced by newly collagens and dietary intake. DPD cross-links of type 1 collagen are excreted in urine either as free or peptide-bound moieties. It is the peptide-bound cross-links that decrease by the greatest amount in response to bisphosphonate therapy. DPD is one of the most extensively characterized biochemical bone markers, but the interpretation of results is hampered by biologic and other preanalytical variability. Biochemical bone markers can provide a valuable tool in the management of metabolic bone diseases. Their most recognized application in clinical practice is for monitoring treatment for osteoporosis as an adjunct to bone mineral density measurements. Other applications that have been investigated include their use as a diagnostic tool for bone diseases other than osteoporosis and as predictive markers for bone loss and the risk of bone fracture. DPD measured in urine follow a circadian or diurnal cycle with a peak in the early morning and nadir in the late afternoon to early evening. The magnitude of the diurnal change, i.e., nadir concentration divided by peak concentration, expressed as a percentage is around 70% (range, 53-75%).

201,Coproporphyrin III,"Coproporhyrin III is a porphyrin metabolite arising from heme synthesis. Porphyrins are pigments found in both animal and plant life. Coproporphyrin III is a tetrapyrrole dead-end product from the spontaneous oxidation of the methylene bridges of coproporphynogen, arising from heme synthesis and secreted in feces and urine. Increased levels of coproporphyrins can indicate congenital erythropoietic porphyria or sideroblastic anaemia. Porphyria is a pathological state characterised by abnormalities of porphyrin metabolism and results in the excretion of large quantities of porphyrins in the urine and in extreme sensitivity to light. A large number of factors are capable of increasing porphyrin excretion, owing to different and multiple causes and etiologies: 1) the main site of the chronic hepatic porphyria disease process concentrates on the liver, 2) a functional and morphologic liver injury is almost regularly associated with this chronic porphyria, 3) the toxic form due to occupational and environmental exposure takes mainly a subclinical course. Hepatic factors includes disturbance in coproporphyrinogen metabolism, which results from inhibition of coproporphyrinogen oxidase as well as from the rapid loss from, and diminished utilization of coproporphyrinogen in the hepatocytes, which may also explain why coproporphyrin, its autoxidation product, predominates physiologically in the urine; decreased biliary excretion of coproporphyrin leading to a compensatory urinary excretion, so that the coproporphyrin ring isomer ratio (1:III) becomes a sensitive index for impaired liver function and intrahepatic cholestasis; and disturbed activity of hepatic uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase. In itself, secondary coproporphyrinuria is not associated with porphyria symptoms of a hepatologic-gastroenterologic, neurologic, or dermatologic order, even though coproporphyrinuria can occur with such symptoms.

202,L-Cysteine,"Cysteine (Cys) is a naturally occurring, sulfur-containing amino acid that is found in most proteins, although only in small quantities. Cysteine is unique amongst the twenty natural amino acids as it contains a thiol group. Thiol groups can undergo oxidation/reduction (redox) reactions; when cysteine is oxidized it can form cystine, which is two cysteine residues joined by a disulfide bond. This reaction is reversible: as reduction of this disulphide bond regenerates two cysteine molecules. The disulphide bonds of cystine are crucial to defining the structures of many proteins. Cysteine is often involved in electron-transfer reactions, and help the enzyme catalyze its reaction. Cysteine is also part of the antioxidant glutathione. N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) is a form of cysteine where an acetyl group is attached to cysteine''s nitrogen atom and is sold as a dietary supplement. Cysteine is named after cystine, which comes from the Greek word kustis meaning bladder - cystine was first isolated from kidney stones.' - As cysteine contains a sulphydryl group, it can undergo redox reactions. Oxidation of cysteine can produce a disulfide bond with another thiol, or further oxidation can produce sulphfinic or sulfonic acids. The cysteine thiol group is also a nucleophile and can undergo addition and substitution reactions. Thiol groups become much more reactive when they are ionized, and cysteine residues in proteins have pKa values close to neutrality, so are often in their reactive thiolate form in the cell. The thiol group also has a high affinity for heavy metals and proteins containing cysteine will bind metals such as mercury, lead and cadmium tightly. - Due to this ability to undergo redox reactions, cysteine has antioxidant properties. Cysteine is an important source of sulfur in human metabolism, and although it is classified as a non-essential amino acid, cysteine may be essential for infants, the elderly, and individuals with certain metabolic disease or who suffer from malabsorption syndromes. Cysteine may at some point be recognized as an essential or conditionally essential amino acid. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cysteine) - Cysteine is important in energy metabolism. As cystine, it is a structural component of many tissues and hormones. Cysteine has clinical uses ranging from baldness to psoriasis to preventing smoker's hack. In some cases, oral cysteine therapy has proved excellent for treatment of asthmatics, enabling them to stop theophylline and other medications. Cysteine also enhances the effect of topically applied silver, tin and zinc salts in preventing dental cavities. In the future, cysteine may play a role in the treatment of cobalt toxicity, diabetes, psychosis, cancer and seizures.

204,Potassium,"Potassium is a metal and an essential electrolyte. Physiologically, potassium exists as an ion in the body. Potassium (K+) is a positively charged electrolyte, cation, which is present throughout the body in both intracellular and extracellular fluids. Potassium balance is crucial for regulating the excitability of nerves and muscles and so critical for regulating contractility of cardiac muscle. Although the most important changes seen in the presence of deranged potassium levels affect cardiac muscles, smooth muscle is also affected with increasing muscle weakness, a feature of both hyperkalaemia and hypokalaemia. The majority of body potassium, >90%, is intracellular. It moves freely from intracellular fluid (ICF) to extracellular fluid (ECF) and vice versa when adenosine triphosphate increases the permeability of the cell membrane. Potassium is mainly replaced inside or outside the cells by another cation, sodium (Na+). The movement of potassium into or out of the cells is linked to certain body hormones and also to certain physiological states. Standard laboratory tests measure ECF potassium. Potassium enters the body rapidly during food ingestion. Insulin is produced when a meal is eaten; this causes the temporary movement of potassium from ECF to ICF. Over the ensuing hours, the kidneys excrete the ingested potassium and homeostasis is returned. In the critically ill patient, suffering from hyperkalaemia, this mechanism can be manipulated beneficially by administering high concentration (50%) intravenous glucose. Insulin can be added to the glucose, but glucose alone will stimulate insulin production and cause movement of potassium from ECF to ICF. The stimulation of alpha receptors causes increased movement of potassium from ICF to ECF. A noradrenaline infusion can elevate serum potassium levels. An adrenaline infusion, or elevated adrenaline levels, can lower serum potassium levels. Metabolic acidosis causes a rise in extracellular potassium levels. In this situation, excess of hydrogen ions (H+) are exchanged for intracellular potassium ions, probably as a result of the cellular response to a falling blood pH. Metabolic alkalosis causes the opposite effect, with potassium moving into the cells.

206,Hydrogen carbonate,"The bicarbonate ion is an anion that consists of one central carbon atom surrounded by three oxygen atoms in a trigonal planar arrangement, with a hydrogen atom attached to one of the oxygens. The bicarbonate ion carries a negative one formal charge and is the conjugate base of carbonic acid, H2CO3. The carbonate radical is an elusive and strong one-electron oxidant. Bicarbonate plays surprisingly important roles in diverse biological processes. Among these are photosynthesis, the Krebs cycle, whole-body and cellular pH regulation, and volume regulation. Since bicarbonate is charged it is not permeable to lipid bilayers. Mammalian membranes thus contain bicarbonate transport proteins to facilitate the specific transmembrane movement of HCO3(-). Bicarbonate in equilibrium with carbon dioxide constitutes the main physiological buffer. The bicarbonate-carbon dioxide pair stimulates the oxidation, peroxidation and nitration of several biological targets. The carbonate radical has been proposed to be a key mediator of the oxidative damage resulting from peroxynitrite production, xanthine oxidase turnover and superoxide dismutase1 peroxidase activity. The carbonate radical has also been proposed to be responsible for the stimulatory effects of the bicarbonate-carbon dioxide pair on oxidations mediated by hydrogen peroxide/transition metal ions. The ultimate precursor of the carbonate radical anion being bicarbonate, carbon dioxide, peroxymonocarbonate or complexes of transition metal ions with bicarbonate-derived species remains a matter of debate. Peroxymonocarbonate is a biological oxidant, whose existence is in equilibrium with hydrogen peroxide and bicarbonate.

207,Chromium,"Chromium is a naturally occurring heavy metal found in the environment commonly in trivalent, Cr(III), and hexavalent, Cr(VI), forms. The reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) results in the formation of reactive intermediates that contribute to the cytotoxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenicity of Cr(VI)-containing compounds. The major non-occupational source of chromium for humans is food such as vegetables, meat, urban air, hip or knee prostheses and cigarettes. Cr(VI) is a widely used in industrial chemicals, extensively used in paints, metal finishes, steel including stainless steel manufacturing, alloy cast irons, chrome and wood treatment. On the contrary, Cr(III) salts such as chromium polynicotinate, chromium chloride and chromium picolinate (CrP) are used as micronutrients and nutritional supplements and have been demonstrated to exhibit a significant number of health benefits in animals and humans. Physiologically, it exists as an ion in the body. - Chromium enters the body through the lungs, gastro-intestinal tract and to a lesser extent through skin. Inhalation is the most important route for occupational exposure, whereas non-occupational exposure occurs via ingestion of chromium-containing food and water. Regardless of route of exposure Cr(III) is poorly absorbed whereas Cr(VI) is more readily absorbed. Further, absorption of Cr(VI) is poorer by oral route, it is thus not very toxic when introduced by the oral route. But chromium is very toxic by dermal and inhalation routes and causes lung cancer, nasal irritation, nasal ulcer, hypersensitivity reactions and contact dermatitis. All the ingested Cr(VI) is reduced to Cr(III) before entering in the blood stream. The main routes for the excretion of chromium are via kidney/urine and the bile/feces. Cr(III) is unable to enter into the cells but Cr(VI) enters through membrane anionic transporters. Intracellular Cr(VI) is metabolically reduced to Cr(III). Cr(VI) does not react with macromolecules such as DNA, RNA, proteins and lipids. However, both Cr(III) and the reductional intermediate Cr(V) are capable of co-ordinate, covalent interactions with macromolecules. Chromium is an essential nutrient required by the human body to promote the action of insulin for the utilization of sugars, proteins and fats. CrP has been used as nutritional supplement; it controls blood sugar in diabetes and may reduce cholesterol and blood pressure levels. Chromium increases insulin binding to cells, insulin receptor number and activates insulin receptor kinase leading to increased insulin sensitivity. But high doses of chromium and long term exposure of it can give rise to various, cytotoxic and genotoxic reactions that affect the immune system of the body. However, the mechanism of the Cr(VI)-induced cytotoxicity is not entirely understood. A series of in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that Cr(VI) induces oxidative stress through enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to genomic DNA damage and oxidative deterioration of lipids and proteins. A cascade of cellular events occur following Cr(VI)-induced oxidative stress including enhanced production of superoxide anion and hydroxyl radicals, increased lipid peroxidation and genomic DNA fragmentation, modulation of intracellular oxidized states, activation of protein kinase C, apoptotic cell death and altered gene expression. Some of the factors in determining the biological outcome of chromium exposure include the bioavailability, solubility of chromium compounds and chemical speciation, intracellular reduction and interaction with DNA. The chromium genotoxicity manifests as several types of DNA lesions, gene mutations and inhibition of macromolecular synthesis. Further, chromium exposure may lead to apoptosis, premature terminal growth arrest or neoplastic transformation. Chromium-induced tumor suppressor gene p53 and oxidative processes are some of the major factors that may determine the cellular outcome. Studies have utilized these approaches to understand the interrelationship between chromium-induced genotoxicity, apoptosis and effects on immune response.

210,D-2-Hydroxyglutaric acid,"D-2-Hydroxyglutaric acid is an alpha hydroxy acid form of glutaric acid. In humans, D-2-hydroxyglutaric acid is formed by a hydroxyacid-oxoacid transhydrogenase whereas in bacteria it is formed by a 2-hydroxyglutarate synthase. D-2-Hydroxyglutaric acid is also formed via the normal activity of hydroxyacid-oxoacid transhydrogenase during conversion of 4-hydroxybutyrate to succinate semialdehyde. The compound can be converted to alpha-ketoglutaric acid through the action of a 2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.99.2). In humans, there are two such enzymes (D2HGDH and L2HGDH). Both the D and the L stereoisomers of hydroxyglutaric acid are found in body fluids. D-2-Hydroxyglutaric acid is a biochemical hallmark of the inherited neurometabolic disorder D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (OMIM: 600721 ) and the genetic disorder glutaric aciduria II. D-2-Hydroxyglutaric aciduria (caused by loss of D2HGDH or gain of function of IDH) is rare, with symptoms including cancer, macrocephaly, cardiomyopathy, mental retardation, hypotonia, and cortical blindness. An elevated urine level of D-2-hydroxyglutaric acid has been reported in patients with spondyloenchondrodysplasia (OMIM: 271550 ). D-2-Hydroxyglutaric acid can be converted to alpha-ketoglutaric acid through the action of 2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (D2HGDH). Additionally, the enzyme D-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) can catalyze the NADH-dependent reduction of alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG) to D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG). Nyhan et al. (1995) described 3 female patients, 2 of them sibs, who were found to have excess accumulation of D-2-hydroxyglutaric acid in the urine. The phenotype was quite variable, even among the sibs, but included mental retardation, macrocephaly with cerebral atrophy, hypotonia, seizures, and involuntary movements. One of the patients developed severe intermittent vomiting and was given a pyloromyotomy. The electroencephalogram demonstrated hypsarrhythmia. There was an increased concentration of protein in cerebrospinal fluid, an unusual finding in inborn errors of metabolism. D-2-Hydroxyglutaric acid can also be produced via gain-of-function mutations in the cytosolic and mitochondrial isoforms of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH). IDH is part of the TCA cycle and this compound is generated in high abundance when IDH is mutated. Since D-2-hydroxyglutaric acid is sufficiently similar in structure to 2-oxoglutarate (2OG), it is able to inhibit a range of 2OG-dependent dioxygenases, including histone lysine demethylases (KDMs) and members of the ten-eleven translocation (TET) family of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) hydroxylases. This inhibitory effect leads to alterations in the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-mediated hypoxic response and alterations in gene expression through global epigenetic remodeling. The net effect is that D-2-hydroxyglutaric acid causes a cascading effect that leads genetic perturbations and malignant transformation. Depending on the circumstances, D-2-hydroxyglutaric acid can act as an oncometabolite, a neurotoxin, an acidogen, and a metabotoxin. An oncometabolite is a compound that promotes tumour growth and survival. A neurotoxin is compound that is toxic to neurons or nerual tissue. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. As an oncometabolite, D-2-hydroxyglutaric acid is a competitive inhibitor of multiple alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, including histone demethylases and the TET family of 5mC hydroxylases. As a result, high levels of 2-hydroxyglutarate lead to genome-wide histone and DNA methylation alterations, which in turn lead to mutations that ultimately cause cancer (PMID: 29038145 ). As a neurotoxin, D-2-hydroxyglutaric acid mediates its neurotoxicity through activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. D-2-Hydroxyglutaric acid is structurally similar to the excitatory amino acid glutamate and stimulates neurodegeneration by mechanisms similar to glutamate, NMDA, or mitochondrial toxins (PMID: 12153528 ). As an acidogen, D-2-hydroxyglutaric acid is classified as an alpha hydroxy acid belonging to the general class of compounds known as organic acids. Chronically high levels of D-2-hydroxyglutaric acid are a feature of the inborn error of metabolism called D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart abnormalities, kidney abnormalities, liver damage, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of untreated D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria. Many affected children with organic acidemias experience intellectual disability or delayed development. In adults, acidosis or acidemia is characterized by headaches, confusion, feeling tired, tremors, sleepiness, and seizures.",HMDB0000606,O[C@H](CCC(O)=O)C(O)=O,C5H8O5,"1S/C5H8O5/c6-3(5(9)10)1-2-4(7)8/h3,6H,1-2H2,(H,7,8)(H,9,10)/t3-/m1/s1",HWXBTNAVRSUOJR-GSVOUGTGSA-N,(2R)-2-hydroxypentanedioic acid,-0.824980223,4.159324461588801,148.114,148.037173366,1.57e+02 g/l,-1.04,0.03,5,3,4,94.83,29.6302,12.972875741537502,D-2-hydroxyglutaric acid,0,-2,-3.8068384384876675,3.276485914460607,1,0,1,0,0,0,MDB00000318,"5376,5377,5384,5385,5386,5387"

The vitamin B12 structure is based on a corrin ring, which, although similar to the porphyrin ring found in heme, chlorophyll, and cytochrome, has two of the pyrrole rings directly bonded. The central metal ion is Co (cobalt). Vitamin B12 cannot be made by plants or by animals, as the only type of organisms that have the enzymes required for the synthesis of vitamin B12 are bacteria and archaea. Higher plants do not concentrate vitamin B12 from the soil and so are a poor source of the substance as compared with animal tissues.

212,Cobalt,"Cobalt has a molecular weight of 58.9 and an atomic number of 27. In the Periodic Table, close to other transition metals, it is situated in group 8, together with rhodium and iridium and it can occur in four oxidation states (0, +2, +3 and +4). The +2 and the ground state are the most common. Cobalt occurs in the minerals cobaltite (Co, Fe) AsS, smaltite (CoAs2), and erythrite Co3(AsO4)2.8H2O, and is often associated with nickel, silver, lead, copper, and iron ores, from which it is most frequently obtained as a by-product. Depending on the considered species, cobalt has multiple industrial applications including the production of alloys and hard metal, diamond polishing, drying agents, pigments and catalysts. Hard metal or cemented carbide is a powder metallurgical product consisting of hard, wear-resistant carbide particles bound together (cemented) with a ductile metal binder (i.e. metallic Co) by liquid phase sintering. Tungsten carbide (WC) is produced by mixing tungsten powder with pure carbon powder at high temperature; hereafter WC is mixed with Co powder to which paraffin is added as a binder. Depending on specific requirements related to their use, hard metals might additionally contain small quantities of chromium, niobium, molybdenum, titanium, tantalum or vanadium carbides. Inhalation and skin contact are the main occupational exposure routes. Occupational exposure to cobalt may result in adverse health effects in different organs or tissues, including the respiratory tract, the skin, the hemapoietic tissues, the myocardium or the thyroid gland. In addition, teratogenic and carcinogenic effects have been observed in experimental systems and/or in humans. For the general population, the diet constitutes the main route of exposure to cobalt, since it is an essential component of Vitamin B12 (hydroxycolalamin). Cobalt functions as a co-factor in enzyme catalysed reactions and is involved in the production of erythropoietin, a hormone that stimulates the formation of erythrocytes. This last property of cobalt was applied in the past as a therapy for anaemia. The carcinogenic potential of cobalt and its compounds was evaluated in 1991 by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), which concluded that there was inadequate evidence for carcinogenicity in humans (lung cancer) but sufficient evidence in experimental animal studies. In most experimental studies considered, the routes of exposure were, however, of questionable relevance for cancer risk assessment in humans for example, local sarcomas after intra-muscular injection. The general conclusion was that cobalt and its compounds are possibly carcinogenic to humans (group 2B). Since this evaluation, additional data have been accumulated which generally indicate that, depending on the considered cobalt species, different outcomes regarding toxicity, mutagenicity and carcinogenicity can be observed. Physiologically, it exists as an ion in the body. Co(II) ions are genotoxic in vitro and in vivo, and carcinogenic in rodents. Co metal is genotoxic in vitro. Hard metal dust, of which occupational exposure is linked to an increased lung cancer risk, is proven to be genotoxic in vitro and in vivo. Possibly, production of active oxygen species and/or DNA repair inhibition are mechanisms involved. Given the recently provided proof for in vitro and in vivo genotoxic potential of hard metal dust, the mechanistic evidence of elevated production of active oxygen species and the epidemiological data on increased cancer risk, it may be advisable to consider the possibility of a new evaluation by IARC.(PMID: 14643417 ). Cobalt is linked to Multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s Disease. In adults (>18 years old) with multiple sclerosis, cobalt is  elevated  in the blood at a concentration of 0.0037 +/- 0.0017 μM  (PMID: 16244395) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 0.00183 (0.00067 - 0.00460) μM  (Geigy Scientific). In adults (>18 years old) with Parkinson’s disease, cobalt is also elevated at a concentration of 0.0019 +/- 0.0085 μM (PMID: 16244395) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 0.00183 (0.00067 - 0.00460) μM (Geigy Scientific).

Cobalt has also shown to be associated with oral squamous cell carcinoma, a type of oral cavity cancer. In adults (>18 years old) with oral squamous cell carcinoma, cobalt has found to be significantly elevated in the saliva at a concentration of 2.715 +/- 0.848 μM  (Natheer H.

214,Cholic acid,"Cholic acid is major primary bile acid produced in the liver and usually conjugated with glycine or taurine. It facilitates fat absorption and cholesterol excretion. - Bile acids are steroid acids found predominantly in bile of mammals. The distinction between different bile acids is minute, depends only on presence or absence of hydroxyl groups on positions 3, 7, and 12. - Bile acids are physiological detergents that facilitate excretion, absorption, and transport of fats and sterols in the intestine and liver. Bile acids are also steroidal amphipathic molecules derived from the catabolism of cholesterol. They modulate bile flow and lipid secretion, are essential for the absorption of dietary fats and vitamins, and have been implicated in the regulation of all the key enzymes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Bile acids recirculate through the liver, bile ducts, small intestine and portal vein to form an enterohepatic circuit. They exist as anions at physiological pH and, consequently, require a carrier for transport across the membranes of the enterohepatic tissues. The unique detergent properties of bile acids are essential for the digestion and intestinal absorption of hydrophobic nutrients. Bile acids have potent toxic properties (e.g., membrane disruption) and there are a plethora of mechanisms to limit their accumulation in blood and tissues.

215,Glutaconic acid,"Glutaconic acid is related to the fully saturated glutaric acid and belongs to the class of compounds known as dicarboxylic acids and derivatives. These are organic compounds containing exactly two carboxylic acid groups. Glutaconic acid is soluble (in water) and has been detected in the urine of individuals with inborn errors of metabolism. When present in sufficiently high levels, glutaconic acid can act as an acidogen, a neurotoxin, and a metabotoxin. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A neurotoxin is a compound that is toxic to neural tissues and cells. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of glutaconic acid are associated with glutaric aciduria type I (glutaric acidemia type I, glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, GA1, or GAT1). GA1 is an inherited disorder in which the body is unable to completely break down the amino acids lysine, hydroxylysine, and tryptophan due to a deficiency of mitochondrial glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.99.7, GCDH). Excessive levels of their intermediate breakdown products (e.g. glutaric acid, glutaryl-CoA, 3-hydroxyglutaric acid, glutaconic acid) can accumulate and cause damage to the brain (and also other organs), but particularly the basal ganglia. GA1 is associated with a risk for intracranial and retinal hemorrhage, and non-specific white matter changes. Babies with glutaric acidemia type I are often born with unusually large heads (macrocephaly). Other symptoms include spasticity (increased muscle tone/stiffness) and dystonia (involuntary muscle contractions resulting in abnormal movement or posture), but many affected individuals are asymptomatic. Seizures and coma (encephalopathy) are rare. GA1 also causes secondary carnitine deficiency because 3-hydroxyglutaric acid, like other organic acids, is detoxified by carnitine. Glutaconic acid's neurotoxicity is thought to be partially caused by an excitotoxic mechanism in which glutaconic acid overactivates N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Accumulating trans-glutaconic (TG) acids have been proposed to be involved in the development of the striatal degeneration seen in children with glutaric acidemia type I via an excitotoxic mechanism.",HMDB0000620,OC(=O)C\C=C\C(O)=O,C5H6O4,"1S/C5H6O4/c6-4(7)2-1-3-5(8)9/h1-2H,3H2,(H,6,7)(H,8,9)/b2-1+",XVOUMQNXTGKGMA-OWOJBTEDSA-N,(2E)-pent-2-enedioic acid,0.043909187333333426,4.5175481219684,130.0987,130.02660868,1.76e+01 g/l,0.05,-0.87,4,2,3,74.6,29.231299999999997,11.364693301928234,glutaconic acid,0,-2,,3.6919558338662966,1,0,1,0,0,0,MDB00000327,5411

Ethylmalonic acid can be synthesized from malonic acid, and can be synthesized into (S)-ethylmalonyl-CoA and (R)-ethylmalonyl-CoA. Ethylmalonic acid can be found in blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and urine, as well as in human fibroblasts, prostate, and skeletal muscle tissues. Moreover, ethylmalonic acid is found to be associated with anorexia nervosa and malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency. In adults (>18 years old) with anorexia nervosa, ethylmalonic acid is elevated in the urine at a concentration of 7.1 +/- 4.4 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 10197568) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 1.16-2.99 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 9439441). Similarly, in children (1-13 years old) with malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency, ethylmalonic acid is elevated in the urine at a concentration of 6-53 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 9177981) compared to normal children at a concentration of <10 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID:  9177981). Ethylmalonic acid is a non-carcinogenic (not listed by IARC) potentially toxic compound. Chronically high levels of ethylmalonic acid are associated with at least two inborn errors of metabolism, including short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (SCAD deficiency) and ethylmalonic encephalopathy. In newborns (0-30 days old) with SCAD deficiency, ethylmalonic acid is significantly elevated in the urine at a concentration of 34.231-1012.319 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 17304052) compared to normal newborns at a concentration of 5.5 (0.1-18.6) μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 8087979). Similarly, in children (1-13 years old) with ethylmalonic encephalopathy, ethylmalonic acid is elevated in the urine at a concentration of 49.2 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 16828325) compared to normal children at a concentration of <20.0 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 16828325). Ethylmalonic acid is identified in the urine of patients with short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, which is a fatty acid metabolism disorder. When present at sufficiently high levels, ethylmalonic acid can act as an acidogen and a metabotoxin. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Ethylmalonic acid is an organic acid. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart abnormalities, kidney abnormalities, liver damage, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of the untreated IEMs mentioned above. Many affected children with organic acidemias experience intellectual disability or delayed development. In adults, acidosis or acidemia is characterized by headaches, confusion, feeling tired, tremors, sleepiness, and seizures.",HMDB0000622,CCC(C(O)=O)C(O)=O,C5H8O4,"1S/C5H8O4/c1-2-3(4(6)7)5(8)9/h3H,2H2,1H3,(H,6,7)(H,8,9)",UKFXDFUAPNAMPJ-UHFFFAOYSA-N,2-ethylpropanedioic acid,0.6564376749999998,6.580590600104313,132.1146,132.042258744,9.41e+01 g/l,0.43,-0.15,4,2,3,74.6,28.1633,11.976514317112754,ethylmalonic acid,0,-2,,2.495963643151088,1,0,1,0,0,0,MDB00000328,"5313,5359,5361,5362,5369,5390,5429,5435"
217,L-Glutamine,"Glutamine (Gln) is one of the 20 amino acids encoded by the standard genetic code. Its side chain is an amide; it is formed by replacing a side-chain hydroxyl of glutamic acid with an amine functional group. Glutamine is found in foods high in proteins, such as fish, red meat, beans, and dairy products. glutamine is a supplement that is used in weightlifting, bodybuilding, endurance and other sports, as well as by those who suffer from muscular cramps or pain particularly elderly people. The main use of glutamine within the diet of either group is as a means of replenishing the body's stores of amino acids that have been used during exercise or everyday activities. Studies which are looking into problems with excessive consumption of glutamine thus far have proved inconclusive. However, normal supplementation is healthy mainly because glutamine is supposed to be supplemented after prolonged periods of exercise (for example, a workout or exercise in which amino acids are required for use) and replenishes amino acid stores; this being the main reason glutamine is recommended during fasting or for people who suffer from physical trauma, immune deficiencies, or cancer. - There is a significant body of evidence that links glutamine-enriched diets with intestinal effects; aiding maintenance of gut barrier function, intestinal cell proliferation and differentiation, as well as generally reducing septic morbidity and the symptoms of Irritable Bowel Syndrome. The reason for such ""cleansing"" properties is thought to stem from the fact that the intestinal extraction rate of glutamine is higher than that for other amino acids, and is therefore thought to be the most viable option when attempting to alleviate conditions relating to the gastrointestinal tract. These conditions were discovered after comparing plasma concentration within the gut between glutamine-enriched and non glutamine-enriched diets. However, even though glutamine is thought to have ""cleansing"" properties and effects, it is unknown to what extent glutamine has clinical benefits, due to the varied concentrations of glutamine in varieties of food. It is also known that glutamine has various effects in reducing healing time after operations. Hospital waiting times after abdominal surgery are reduced by providing parenteral nutrition regimens containing amounts of glutamine to patients. Clinical trials have revealed that patients on supplementation regimes containing glutamine have improved nitrogen balances, generation of cysteinyl-leukotrienes from polymorphonuclear neutrophil granulocytes and improved lymphocyte recovery and intestinal permeability (in postoperative patients) - in comparison to those who had no glutamine within their dietary regime; all without any side-effects.

218,Coproporphyrin I,"Coproporhyrin I is a porphyrin metabolite arising from heme synthesis. Porphyrins are pigments found in both animal and plant life. Coproporphyrin I is a tetrapyrrole dead-end product from the spontaneous oxidation of the methylene bridges of coproporphynogen, arising from heme synthesis and secreted in feces and urine. Increased levels of coproporphyrins can indicate congenital erythropoietic porphyria or sideroblastic anaemia. Porphyria is a pathological state characterised by abnormalities of porphyrin metabolism and results in the excretion of large quantities of porphyrins in the urine and in extreme sensitivity to light. A large number of factors are capable of increasing porphyrin excretion, owing to different and multiple causes and etiologies: 1) the main site of the chronic hepatic porphyria disease process concentrates on the liver, 2) a functional and morphologic liver injury is almost regularly associated with this chronic porphyria, 3) the toxic form due to occupational and environmental exposure takes mainly a subclinical course.' Hepatic factors includes disturbance in coproporphyrinogen metabolism, which results from inhibition of coproporphyrinogen oxidase as well as from the rapid loss from, and diminished utilization of coproporphyrinogen in the hepatocytes, which may also explain why coproporphyrin, its autoxidation product, predominates physiologically in the urine; decreased biliary excretion of coproporphyrin leading to a compensatory urinary excretion, so that the coproporphyrin ring isomer ratio (1:III) becomes a sensitive index for impaired liver function and intrahepatic cholestasis; and disturbed activity of hepatic uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase. In itself, secondary coproporphyrinuria is not associated with porphyria symptoms of a hepatologic-gastroenterologic, neurologic, or dermatologic order, even though coproporphyrinuria can occur with such symptoms.

219,L-Arabinose,"L-Arabinose is a pentose with a sweet taste and one of the most abundant components released by complete hydrolysis of non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) of vegetable origin. However, NSPs are complicated compounds from the point of view of both physical structure and chemical composition, and they include cellulose, hemi-cellulose, pectin and oligosaccharides. It is well recognized that NSPs are resistant to the digestive enzymes and pass to the hind-gut where microbial degradation takes place. When L-Arabinose is ingested in a digestible form, it is absorbed from the intestinal tract but at a lower rate than glucose. A portion of the ingested L-Arabinose is excreted in the urine. Although widely present in nature, L-Arabinose is rarely used, and its physiological effects in vivo have received little attention. L-Arabinose selectively inhibits intestinal sucrase activity in a noncompetitive manner and suppresses the plasma glucose increase due to sucrose ingestion. Because the intestinal absorption of sucrose is inhibited in the presence of L-Arabinose, the absorption of sucrose should be reduced by arabinose ingestion. Most of the studies reported so far on the absorption and utilization of L-Arabinose relate to omnivore animal species other than humans. In a rare case of two autistic brothers that were not associated with any known metabolic disease, it was found the median value for their urine samples was 179 umol/mmol creatinine of L-Arabinose, nearly six times greater than normal children.

Cholesterol sulfate is a component of cell membranes where it has a stabilizing role, e.g., protecting erythrocytes from osmotic lysis and regulating sperm capacitation. It is present in platelet membranes where it supports platelet adhesion. Cholesterol sulfate can regulate the activity of serine proteases involved in blood clotting, fibrinolysis, and epidermal cell adhesion. As a result of its ability to regulate the activity of selective protein kinase C isoforms and modulate the specificity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, cholesterol sulfate is involved in signal transduction. Cholesterol sulfate also functions in keratinocyte differentiation, inducing genes that encode for key components involved in development of the barrier.

222,Copper,"Copper is an essential nutrient to all higher plants and animals. Physiologically, it exists as an ion in the body. In animals, it is found primarily in the bloodstream, as a cofactor in various enzymes, and in copper-based pigments. In the body, copper shifts between the cuprous (Cu1+) and cupric (Cu2+) forms, though the majority of the body's copper is in the Cu2+ form. The ability of copper to easily accept and donate electrons explains its important role in oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions and in scavenging free radicals. Copper is a critical functional component of a number of essential enzymes known as cuproenzymes. For instance, the copper-dependent enzyme, cytochrome c oxidase, plays a critical role in cellular energy production. By catalyzing the reduction of molecular oxygen (O2) to water (H2O), cytochrome c oxidase generates an electrical gradient used by the mitochondria to create the vital energy-storing molecule, ATP. Another cuproenzyme, lysyl oxidase, is required for the cross-linking of collagen and elastin, which are essential for the formation of strong and flexible connective tissue. Another cuproeznyme, Monoamine oxidase (MAO), plays a role in the metabolism of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine. MAO also functions in the degradation of the neurotransmitter serotonin, which is the basis for the use of MAO inhibitors as antidepressants. One of the most important cuproenzymes is Superoxide dismutase (SOD). SOD functions as an antioxidant by catalyzing the conversion of superoxide radicals (free radicals or ROS) to hydrogen peroxide, which can subsequently be reduced to water by other antioxidant enzymes. Two forms of SOD contain copper: 1) copper/zinc SOD is found within most cells of the body, including red blood cells, and 2) extracellular SOD is a copper-containing enzyme found at high levels in the lungs and low levels in blood plasma. In sufficient amounts, copper can be poisonous or even fatal to organisms. Copper is normally bound to cuproenzymes (such as SOD, MOA) and is thus only toxic when unsequestered and unmediated. It is believed that zinc and copper compete for absorption in the digestive tract so that a diet that is excessive in one of these minerals may result in a deficiency in the other. An imbalance of zinc and copper status might be involved in human hypertension. Furthermore, copper is found to be associated with hyperzincaemia and hypercalprotectinaemia and Wilson's disease, which are inborn errors of metabolism.",HMDB0000657,[Cu++],Cu,1S/Cu/q+2,JPVYNHNXODAKFH-UHFFFAOYSA-N,copper(2+) ion,0.156,3.55,63.546,62.929601079,,,,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,1.7784,copper(2+) ion,2,2,,3.09,1,0,1,0,1,0,MDB00000346,"5185,5225,5241,5283,5392,5460,5515"
223,D-Fructose,"Fructose, or levulose, is a levorotatory monosaccharide and an isomer of glucose (C6H12O6). The chemical composition of fructose is (C6H12O6). Pure fructose has a sweet taste similar to cane sugar, but with a ""fruity"" aroma. Although fructose is a hexose (6 carbon sugar), it generally exists as a 5-member hemiketal ring (a furanose). This structure is responsible for the long metabolic pathway and high reactivity compared to glucose. Fructose is found in many foods and is one of the three most important blood sugars along with glucose and galactose. Honey; tree fruits; berries; melons; and some root vegetables, such as beets, sweet potatoes, parsnips and onions, contain fructose, usually in combination with sucrose and glucose. Fructose is also derived from the digestion of sucrose, a disaccharide consisting of glucose and fructose that is broken down by enzymes during digestion. Fructose is the sweetest naturally occurring sugar, estimated to be twice as sweet as sucrose. It is used as a preservative and an intravenous infusion in parenteral feeding. Fructose is a reducing sugar, as are all monosaccharides. The spontaneous addition of single sugar molecules to proteins, known as glycation, is a significant cause of damage in diabetics. Fructose appears to be as dangerous as glucose in this regard and so does not seem to be the answer for diabetes (McPherson et al, 1988). This may be an important contribution to senescence and many age-related chronic diseases (Levi & Werman 1998).↵",HMDB0000660,OC[C@H]1O[C@](O)(CO)[C@@H](O)[C@@H]1O,C6H12O6,"1S/C6H12O6/c7-1-3-4(9)5(10)6(11,2-8)12-3/h3-5,7-11H,1-2H2/t3-,4-,5+,6-/m1/s1",RFSUNEUAIZKAJO-ARQDHWQXSA-N,"(2R,3S,4S,5R)-2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)oxolane-2,3,4-triol",-2.7579993179999995,12.727992395711098,180.1559,180.063388116,1.11e+03 g/l,-2.45,0.79,6,5,2,110.38000000000001,36.3608,16.264519672327737,fructose,0,0,-2.981428882582282,10.284334729790022,1,1,1,0,0,0,MDB00000348,5200
224,Glutaric acid,"Glutaric acid is a simple five-carbon linear dicarboxylic acid. Glutaric acid is naturally produced in the body during the metabolism of some amino acids, including lysine and tryptophan. Glutaric acid may cause irritation to the skin and eyes. When present in sufficiently high levels, glutaric acid can act as an acidogen and a metabotoxin. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of glutaric acid are associated with at least three inborn errors of metabolism, including glutaric aciduria type I, malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency, and glutaric aciduria type III. Glutaric aciduria type I (glutaric acidemia type I, glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, GA1, or GAT1) is an inherited disorder in which the body is unable to completely break down the amino acids lysine, hydroxylysine, and tryptophan due to a deficiency of mitochondrial glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.99.7, GCDH). Excessive levels of their intermediate breakdown products (e.g. glutaric acid, glutaryl-CoA, 3-hydroxyglutaric acid, glutaconic acid) can accumulate and cause damage to the brain (and also other organs). In newborns (0-30 days old) with glutaric aciduria type 1, glutaric acid is significantly elevatd in the blood at a concentration of 43 μM (PMID: 9350903) compared to normal newborns at a concentration of 0 - 1.8 μM (PMID: 9350903).Babies with glutaric acidemia type I are often born with unusually large heads (macrocephaly). Macrocephaly is amongst the earliest signs of GA1. GA1 also causes secondary carnitine deficiency because glutaric acid, like other organic acids, is detoxified by carnitine. In infants (0-1 year) with malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency, glutaric acid is elevated in the urine at a concentration of 40 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 3709568) compared to normal infants at a concentration of 1.0-3.0 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 31963255). Glutaric acid is also found to be linked to short chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (SCAD) where infants (0-1 day old) with SCAD have reduced levels of glutaric acid in the urine at a concentration of 0-18.200 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 7776094) compared to normal infants at a concentration of 5.800 +/- 3.800 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 7776094). Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart, liver, and kidney abnormalities, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of untreated glutaric aciduria. Many affected children with organic acidemias experience intellectual disability or delayed development. In adults, acidosis or acidemia is characterized by headaches, confusion, feeling tired, tremors, sleepiness, and seizures. Treatment of glutaric aciduria is mainly based on the restriction of lysine intake, supplementation of carnitine, and an intensification of therapy during intercurrent illnesses.

It is often denoted in technical food science literature by the shorthand 18:2 (n-6) or 18:2 cis-9,12.  LA is a polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), in which the first double bond is located between the sixth and seventh carbon atom from the methyl end of the fatty acid (n-6). Linoleic acid is an essential fatty acid in human nutrition because it cannot be synthesized by humans. It is used in the biosynthesis of prostaglandins (via arachidonic acid) and cell membranes. It typically occurs in nature as a triglyceride (an ester of glycerin) rather than as a free fatty acid. It is abundant in safflower, sunflower, corn, and comprises over half their composition by weight. It is present in medium quantities in soybean oils, sesame, and almonds.

228,Iodine,"Iodine is an essential trace element. Chemically, iodine is the least reactive of the halogens, and the most electropositive halogen after astatine. However, iodine does not occur in the free state in nature. As with all other halogens , when freed from its compounds iodine forms diatomic molecules (I2). Iodine and its compounds are primarily used in medicine, photography, and dyes. Iodine is required for the production of thyroid hormones, which are essential for normal brain development, and the fetus, newborn, and young child are particularly vulnerable to iodine deficiency. Physiologically, iodine exists as an ion (I-)  in the body. The iodine requirement increases during pregnancy and recommended intakes are in the range of 220-250 microg/day. Monitoring iodine status during pregnancy is a challenge. New recommendations from World Health Organization suggest that a median urinary iodine concentration >250 microg/L and <500 microg/L indicates adequate iodine intake in pregnancy. Based on this range, it appears that many pregnant women in have inadequate intakes. Thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration in the newborn is a sensitive indicator of mild iodine deficiency in late pregnancy. The potential adverse effects of mild iodine deficiency during pregnancy are uncertain. Controlled trials of iodine supplementation in mildly iodine-deficient pregnant women suggest beneficial effects on maternal and newborn serum thyroglobulin and thyroid volume, but no effects on maternal and newborn total or free thyroid hormone concentrations. There are no long-term data on the effect of iodine supplementation on birth outcomes or infant development. New data from well-controlled studies indicate that iodine repletion in moderately iodine-deficient school-age children has clear benefits: it improves cognitive and motor function; it also increases concentrations of insulin-like growth factor 1 and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 and improves somatic growth.

(PMID 11592966) - Oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is thought to be a major factor in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis. Elevated plasma homocysteine is an accepted risk factor for atherosclerosis, and may act through LDL oxidation, although this is controversial. However, the major thiol in plasma is cysteine, which is present at concentrations approximately 10 times greater than homocysteine; therefore homocystine in plasma is insignificant, and consequently homocystine is unlikely to influence LDL oxidation in vivo. (PMID 14732479) - Increasing evidence supports a role for an elevation of homocysteine in schizophrenia. It has been demonstrated that neural tube defects are related to a genetic defect in homocysteine metabolism. Sufficient intake of folic acid is believed to reduce this risk by enhancing methylation of homocysteine and its conversion to methionine, thereby compensating for this genetic defect. Plasma homocysteine levels are elevated when folate levels are in the lower half of the normal range.

230,Isovalerylglycine,"Isovalerylglycine (IVG) is an acyl glycine. Acyl glycines are normally minor metabolites of fatty acids. However, the excretion of certain acyl glycines is increased in several inborn errors of metabolism. In certain cases the measurement of these metabolites in body fluids can be used to diagnose disorders associated with mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation. Acyl glycines are produced through the action of glycine N-acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.13) which is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction: acyl-CoA + glycine < -- > CoA + N-acylglycine. Isovalerylglycine is a byproduct of the catabolism of the amino acid leucine. Accumulation of isovalerylglycine occurs in Isovaleric Acidemia (IVA). IVA (OMIM/ McKusick 243500) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.99.10) gene. The deficiency of this enzyme in the metabolism of leucine leads to the accumulation of a series of isovaleryl-CoA metabolites, such as isovalerylglycine. It is very important to caution for false positive results when screening for isovaleric acidemia by tandem mass spectrometry based on dried blood-spot levels of C5-acylcarnitines, including isovalerylcarnitine and its isomer, pivaloylcarnitine; pivaloylcarnitine is derived from pivalate-generating antibiotics, and has caused many false-positive results (PMID: 17850781 ). Isovalerylglycine is a biomarker for the consumption of cheese. In newborns (0-30 days old) diagnosed with isovaleric acidemia, IVG is found to be elevated in the blood at a concentration of 40.0 (1.3-80.0) μM(PMID: 17850781) compared to normal newborns at a concentration of 0.17 +/- 0.03 μM(PMID: 17850781). IVG is also associated with 2-Methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (SBACDD) where infants with SBACDD have shown reduced levels of IVG in the urine at a concentration of 0.0710-1.0654 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 12837870) compared to normal infants at a concentration of 0.213-10.157 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID:  12837870). IVG is also associated with anorexia nervosa, an eating disorder characterized by an abnormally low body weight, an intense fear of gaining weight and a distorted perception of weight. In adolescents (13-18 years old) with anorexia nervosa, IVG is elevated in the urine at a concentration of 7.7 +/- 4.8 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 10197568) compared to normal adolescents at a concentration of 3.8 +/- 0.9 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 10197568). Finally, IVG has shown to be associated with ethylmalonic encephalopathy, an inherited disorder that affects several body systems, particularly the nervous system. In adolescents (13-18 years old) with ethylmalonic encephalopathy, IVG is significantly elevated in the urine at a concentration of 3.4 - 36 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 7609451) compared to normal adolescents at a concentration of 0 - 4.5 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 7609451).",HMDB0000678,CC(C)CC(=O)NCC(O)=O,C7H13NO3,"1S/C7H13NO3/c1-5(2)3-6(9)8-4-7(10)11/h5H,3-4H2,1-2H3,(H,8,9)(H,10,11)",ZRQXMKMBBMNNQC-UHFFFAOYSA-N,2-(3-methylbutanamido)acetic acid,0.10349465433333323,15.905941443928317,159.183,159.089543287,6.50e+00 g/l,0.35,-1.39,3,2,4,66.4,39.2237,16.39546018458692,isovalerylglycine,0,-1,-1.7399347523033928,4.166378508060191,1,0,1,0,0,0,MDB00000360,"5272,5273,5291,5313,5369,5379,5429,5433"

Indoxyl sulfate is a circulating uremic toxin stimulating glomerular sclerosis and interstitial fibrosis. Indoxyl sulfate is one of the well known substances of a group of protein-bound uremic retention solutes. Indoxyl sulfate increases the rate of progression of renal failure. In plasma, indoxyl sulfate is a protein-bound uremic solute that induces endothelial dysfunction by inhibiting endothelial proliferation and migration in vitro. Some studies suggest that indoxyl sulfate is also involved in oxidative stress. In hemodialyzed patients, serum levels of indoxyl sulfate are associated with levels of pentosidine, a marker of carbonyl and oxidative stress; in vitro, indoxyl sulfate increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in tubular cells, and increases NAD(P)H oxidase activity in endothelial cells. Indoxyl sulfate impairs osteoblst function and induces abnormalities of bone turnover. Indoxyl sulfate strongly decreases the levels of glutathione, one of the most active antioxidant systems of the cell.

232,L-Leucine,"Leucine (abbreviated as Leu or L) is an alpha-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. It contains an alpha-amino group (which is in the protonated −NH3+ form under biological conditions), an α-carboxylic acid group (which is in the deprotonated −COO− form under biological conditions), and a side chain isobutyl group, making it a non-polar aliphatic amino acid. It is essential in humans, meaning the body cannot synthesize it, and it must be obtained from the diet. Human dietary sources are foods that contain protein, such as meats, dairy products, soy products, beans and legumes. L-Leucine is a branched chain amino acid (BCAA). The BCAAs consist of leucine, valine and isoleucine (and occasionally threonine). BCAAs are essential amino acids whose carbon structure is marked by a branch point. BCAAs are critical to human life and are particularly involved in stress, energy and muscle metabolism. BCAA supplementation as therapy, both oral and intravenous, in human health and disease holds great promise. ''BCAA'' denotes valine, isoleucine and leucine which are branched chain essential amino acids. Despite their structural similarities, the branched amino acids have different metabolic routes, with valine going solely to carbohydrates, leucine solely to fats and isoleucine to both. The different metabolism accounts for different requirements for these essential amino acids in humans: 12 mg/kg, 14 mg/kg and 16 mg/kg of valine, leucine and isoleucine respectively. Furthermore, these amino acids have different deficiency symptoms. Valine deficiency is marked by neurological defects in the brain, while isoleucine deficiency is marked by muscle tremors.' - Many types of inborn errors of BCAA metabolism exist, and are marked by various abnormalities. The most common form is the maple syrup urine disease, marked by a characteristic urinary odor. Other abnormalities are associated with a wide range of symptoms, such as mental retardation, ataxia, hypoglycemia, spinal muscle atrophy, rash, vomiting and excessive muscle movement. Most forms of BCAA metabolism errors are corrected by dietary restriction of BCAAs and at least one form is correctable by supplementation with 10 mg of biotin daily. - BCAAs are useful because they are metabolized primarily by muscle. Stress state- e.g surgery, trauma, cirrhosis, infections, fever and starvation--require proportionately more BCAAs than other amino acids and probably proportionately more leucine than either valine or isoleucine. BCAAs and other amino acids are frequently fed intravenously (TPN) to malnourished surgical patients and in some cases of severe trauma. BCAAs, particularly leucine, stimulate protein synthesis, increase reutilization of amino acids in many organs and reduce protein breakdown. Furthermore, leucine can be an important source of calories, and is superior as fuel to the ubiquitous intravenous glucose (dextrose). - Leucine also stimulates insulin release, which in turn stimulates protein synthesis and inhibits protein breakdown. These effects are particularly useful in athletic training. Huntington's chorea and anorexic disorders both are characterized by low serum BCAAs. These diseases, as well as forms of Parkinson's, may respond to BCAA therapy. BCAA, and particularly leucine, are among the amino acids most essential for muscle health.

233,Isovalerylcarnitine,"Isovalerylcarnitine is the phenotypic abnormality in isovaleric acidemia (OMIM 243500 ) resulting from an accμMulation of isovaleric acid, which is toxic to the central nervous system. Isovaleric acidemia is an autosomal recessive inborn error of leucine metabolism caused by a deficiency of the mitochondrial enzyme isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.99.10) resulting in the accμMulation of derivatives of isovaleryl-CoA. It was the first organic acidemia recognized in hμMans and can cause significant morbidity and mortality. Early diagnosis and treatment with a protein restricted diet and supplementation with carnitine and glycine are effective in promoting normal development in severely affected individuals. An alternative pathway through glycine-N-acylase (EC 2.3.1.13) allows detoxification by producing isovalerylglycine, which is excreted. Thus, isovalerylcarnitine and isovalerylglycine are the hallmarks of this disorder in plasma and urine, respectively, and are elevated regardless of a patient's metabolic condition (PMID: 16602101). In individuals with isovaleric acidemia, the concentration isovalerylcarnitine is elevated in the blood at a concentration of 27.300-48.200 μM (PMID: 12837870) compared to normal individuals at a concentration of <0.600 μM (PMID: 12837870). Moreover, isovalerylcarnitine is found to be associated with celiac disease and very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (VLCAD), which are also inborn errors of metabolism. Isovalerylcarnitine has shown to be associated with celiac disease, a chronic digestive and immune disorder that damages the small intestine.

234,Malonic acid,"Malonic acid (IUPAC systematic name: propanedioic acid), also known as malonate or H2MALO is a dicarboxylic acid with structure CH2(COOH)2, belonging to the class of organic compounds known as dicarboxylic acids and derivatives. These are organic compounds containing exactly two carboxylic acid groups. The ionised form of malonic acid, as well as its esters and salts, are known as malonates. For example, diethyl malonate is malonic acid's ethyl ester. The name originates from Latin malum, meaning apple. Malonic acid is the archetypal example of a competitive inhibitor: it acts against succinate dehydrogenase (complex II) in the respiratory electron transport chain. Malonic acid is a very hydrophobic molecule, practically insoluble (in water), and relatively neutral. Malonic acid exists in all living species, ranging from bacteria to humans. Within humans, malonic acid participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, malonic acid and acetic acid can be converted into acetoacetic acid, which is mediated by the enzyme fatty acid synthase. Beta ketoacyl synthase domain. In addition, malonic acid and coenzyme A can be biosynthesized from malonyl-CoA through its interaction with the enzyme fatty acid synthase. malonyl/acetyl transferase domain. A malonic acid in which the two carboxy groups are separated by a single methylene group. In humans, malonic acid is involved in fatty acid biosynthesis. Outside of the human body, Malonic acid has been detected, but not quantified in, several different foods, such as red beetroots, corns, scarlet beans, common beets, and cow milks. This could make malonic acid a potential biomarker for the consumption of these foods. Malonic acid, with regard to humans, has been found to be associated with several diseases such as eosinophilic esophagitis, combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria, and early preeclampsia; malonic acid has also been linked to the inborn metabolic disorder malonyl-coa decarboxylase deficiency. Malonic acid is mainly associated with malonyl-Coa decarboxylase deficiency, a condition that prevents the body from converting certain fats to energy.

Malonic acid is associated with combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria, a condition characterized by high levels of malonic acid and methylmalonic acid, in the body. In adults (>18 years old) with combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria, malonic acid is elevated in the blood at a concentration of 2.1-5.5 μM (PMID: 21841779) compared to normal adults at a concentration <0.89 μM (PMID: 21841779).",HMDB0000691,OC(=O)CC(O)=O,C3H4O4,"1S/C3H4O4/c4-2(5)1-3(6)7/h1H2,(H,4,5)(H,6,7)",OFOBLEOULBTSOW-UHFFFAOYSA-N,propanedioic acid,-0.3311172683333333,5.919487044057661,104.0615,104.010958616,1.97e+02 g/l,-0.60,0.28,4,2,2,74.6,18.9878,8.127328970673815,malonic acid,0,-2,,2.4284239631132736,1,0,1,0,0,0,MDB00000367,"5338,5390,5391,5440,5485,5486"
235,Iron,"Iron is a chemical element with the symbol Fe and atomic number 26. Iron makes up 5% of the Earth's crust and is second in abundance to aluminium among the metals and fourth in abundance among the elements. Physiologically, it exists as an ion in the body. Iron (as Fe2+, ferrous ion) is a necessary trace element used by all known living organisms. Iron-containing enzymes, usually containing heme prosthetic groups, participate in catalysis of oxidation reactions in biology, and in transport of a number of soluble gases. Iron is an essential constituent of hemoglobin, cytochrome, and other components of respiratory enzyme systems. Its chief functions are in the transport of oxygen to tissue (hemoglobin) and in cellular oxidation mechanisms. Inorganic iron involved in redox reactions is also found in the iron-sulfur clusters of many enzymes, such as nitrogenase (involved in the synthesis of ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen) and hydrogenase. A class of non-heme iron proteins is responsible for a wide range of functions such as ribonucleotide reductase (reduces ribose to deoxyribose; DNA biosynthesis) and purple acid phosphatase (hydrolysis of phosphate esters). When the body is fighting a bacterial infection, the body sequesters iron inside of cells (mostly stored in the storage molecule ferritin) so that it cannot be used by bacteria. Depletion of iron stores may result in iron-deficiency anemia. Iron is used to build up the blood in anemia. Humans experience iron toxicity above 20 milligrams of iron for every kilogram of weight, and 60 milligrams per kilogram is a lethal dose. Over-consumption of iron, often the result of children eating large quantities of ferrous sulfate tablets intended for adult consumption, is the most common toxicological cause of death in children under six. The DRI lists the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for adults as 45 mg/day. For children under fourteen years old the UL is 40 mg/day. Iron is a metal extracted from iron ore, and is almost never found in the free elemental state.↵",HMDB0000692,[Fe++],Fe,1S/Fe/q+2,CWYNVVGOOAEACU-UHFFFAOYSA-N,lambda2-iron(2+) ion,-0.77,5.46,55.845,55.934942133,,,,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,1.7784,lambda2-iron(2+) ion,2,2,,4.58,1,0,1,0,1,0,MDB00000368,"5185,5225,5460"
236,L-2-Hydroxyglutaric acid,"L-2-Hydroxyglutaric acid is a metabolite that accumulates in L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria, which is a neurometabolic disorder (OMIM: 236792 ), and has been reported in multiple patients who have a clinical phenotype of progressive neurodegeneration with extrapyramidal and cerebellar signs, seizures, and spongiform changes in the white matter (OMIM: 600721 ). In humans, 2-hydroxyglutarate is formed by a hydroxyacid-oxoacid transhydrogenase whereas in bacteria it is formed by a 2-hydroxyglutarate synthase. L-2-Hydroxyglutaric acid can be converted to alpha-ketoglutaric acid through the action of 2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.99.2). In humans, there are two such enzymes (D2HGDH and L2HGDH). Both the D and L stereoisomers of hydroxyglutaric acid are found in body fluids. L-2-Hydroxyglutaric acid can also be produced via gain-of-function mutations in the cytosolic and mitochondrial isoforms of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH). IDH is part of the TCA cycle and this compound is generated in high abundance when IDH is mutated. Since L-2-hydroxyglutaric acid is sufficiently similar in structure to 2-oxoglutarate (2OG), it is able to inhibit a range of 2OG-dependent dioxygenases, including histone lysine demethylases (KDMs) and members of the ten-eleven translocation (TET) family of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) hydroxylases. This inhibitory effect leads to alterations in the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-mediated hypoxic response and alterations in gene expression through global epigenetic remodeling. The net effect is that L-2-hydroxyglutaric acid causes a cascading effect that leads genetic perturbations and malignant transformation. Depending on the circumstances, L-2-hydroxyglutaric acid can function as an oncometabolite, a neurotoxin, an acidogen, and a metabotoxin. An oncometabolite is a compound that promotes tumour growth and survival. A neurotoxin is compound that is toxic to neurons or neural tissue. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. As an oncometabolite, L-2-hydroxyglutaric acid is a competitive inhibitor of multiple alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, including histone demethylases and the TET family of 5mC hydroxylases. As a result, high levels of 2-hydroxyglutarate lead to genome-wide histone and DNA methylation alterations, which in turn lead to mutations that ultimately cause cancer (PMID: 29038145 ). As a neurotoxin, L-2-hydroxyglutaric acid mediates its neurotoxicity through activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. L-2-Hydroxyglutaric acid is structurally similar to the excitatory amino acid glutamate and stimulates neurodegeneration by mechanisms similar to glutamate, NMDA, or mitochondrial toxins (PMID: 12153528 ). As an acidogen, L-2-hydroxyglutaric acid is classified as an alpha hydroxy acid belonging to the general class of compounds known as organic acids. Chronically high levels of L-2-hydroxyglutaric acid are characteristic of the inborn error of metabolism called L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart abnormalities, kidney abnormalities, liver damage, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are the symptoms typical of untreated L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria. Many affected children with organic acidemias experience intellectual disability or delayed development. In adults, acidosis or acidemia is characterized by headaches, confusion, feeling tired, tremors, sleepiness, and seizures.",HMDB0000694,O[C@H](CCC(O)=O)C(O)=O,C5H8O5,"1S/C5H8O5/c6-3(5(9)10)1-2-4(7)8/h3,6H,1-2H2,(H,7,8)(H,9,10)/t3-/m1/s1",HWXBTNAVRSUOJR-GSVOUGTGSA-N,(2S)-2-hydroxypentanedioic acid,-0.824980223,4.159324461588801,148.114,148.037173366,1.57e+02 g/l,-1.04,0.03,5,3,4,94.83000000000001,29.6302,12.9730498807228,L-2-hydroxyglutaric acid,0,-2,-3.8068384384876675,3.276485914460605,1,0,1,0,0,0,MDB00000370,"5313,5376,5385,5386,5387"
237,Ketoleucine,"Ketoleucine is an abnormal metabolite that arises from the incomplete breakdown of branched-chain amino acids. Ketoleucine is both a neurotoxin and a metabotoxin. A neurotoxin causes damage to nerve cells and nerve tissues. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of ketoleucine are associated with maple syrup urine disease (MSUD). MSUD is a metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency of the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC), leading to a buildup of the branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) and their toxic by-products (ketoacids) in the blood and urine. The symptoms of MSUD often show in infancy and lead to severe brain damage if untreated. MSUD may also present later depending on the severity of the disease. If left untreated in older individuals, during times of metabolic crisis, symptoms of the condition include uncharacteristically inappropriate, extreme, or erratic behaviour and moods, hallucinations, anorexia, weight loss, anemia, diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, lethargy, oscillating hypertonia and hypotonia, ataxia, seizures, hypoglycemia, ketoacidosis, opisthotonus, pancreatitis, rapid neurological decline, and coma. In maple syrup urine disease, the brain concentration of branched-chain ketoacids can increase 10- to 20-fold. This leads to a depletion of glutamate and a consequent reduction in the concentration of brain glutamine, aspartate, alanine, and other amino acids. The result is a compromise of energy metabolism because of a failure of the malate-aspartate shuttle and a diminished rate of protein synthesis (PMID: 15930465 ).",HMDB0000695,CC(C)CC(=O)C(O)=O,C6H10O3,"1S/C6H10O3/c1-4(2)3-5(7)6(8)9/h4H,3H2,1-2H3,(H,8,9)",BKAJNAXTPSGJCU-UHFFFAOYSA-N,4-methyl-2-oxopentanoic acid,1.4979975616666668,,130.1418,130.062994186,6.76e+00 g/l,0.82,-1.28,3,1,3,54.37,31.7662,12.995994785498697,ketoisocaproate,0,-1,-9.662090237480372,3.528051095084082,1,0,1,0,0,0,MDB00000371,"5313,5476"
238,L-Methionine,"Methionine (Met) is a dietary indispensable amino acid required for normal growth and development of humans, other mammals, and avian species. In addition to being a substrate for protein synthesis, it is an intermediate in transmethylation reactions, serving as the major methyl group donor in vivo, including the methyl groups for DNA and RNA intermediates. Methionine is a methyl acceptor for 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyl transferase (methionine synthase), the only reaction that allows for the recycling of this form of folate, and is also a methyl acceptor for the catabolism of betaine. Methionine is also required for synthesis of cysteine. Methionine is accepted as the metabolic precursor for cysteine. Only the sulfur atom from methionine is transferred to cysteine; the carbon skeleton of cysteine is donated by serine. (PMID 16702340) - The adequacy range of dietary requirements of specific amino acids in disease states is difficult to determine. Requirements may not be similar in disease with regard to protein synthesis. Requirements for this purpose can be assessed only when such a function can be measured and related to clinical outcome. There is apparent consensus concerning normal sulfur amino acid (SAA) requirements. WHO recommendations amount to 13 mg/kg per 24 h in healthy adults. This amount is roughly doubled in artificial nutrition regimens. In disease or after trauma, requirements may be altered for methionine, cysteine, and taurine. Although in specific cases of congenital enzyme deficiency, prematurity, or diminished liver function, hypermethionemia or hyperhomocysteinemia may occur, SAA supplementation can be considered safe in amounts exceeding 2-3 times the minimal recommended daily intake. Apart from some very specific indications (e.g., acetaminophen poisoning) the usefulness of SAA supplementation is not yet established.(PMID 16702341) - Methionine is known to exacerbate psychopathological symptoms in schizophrenic patients, there is no evidence of similar effects in healthy subjects. The role of methionine as a precursor of homocysteine is the most notable cause for concern. A ""loading dose"" of methionine (0.1 g/kg) has been given, and the resultant acute increase in plasma homocysteine has been used as an index of the susceptibility to cardiovascular disease. Although this procedure results in vascular dysfunction, this is acute and unlikely to result in permanent damage. However, a 10-fold larger dose, given mistakenly, resulted in death. Longer-term studies in adults have indicated no adverse consequences of moderate fluctuations in dietary methionine intake, but intakes higher than 5 times normal resulted in elevated homocysteine levels. These effects of methionine on homocysteine and vascular function are moderated by supplements of vitamins B-6, B-12, C, and folic acid. In infants, methionine intakes of 2 to 5 times normal resulted in impaired growth and extremely high plasma methionine levels, but no adverse long-term consequences were observed.

240,3-Hydroxypropionic acid,"3-Hydroxypropionic acid is a carboxylic acid. It is an intermediate in the breakdown of branched-chain amino acids and propionic acid from the gut. Typically it originates from propionyl-CoA and a defect in the enzyme propionyl carboxylase. This leads to a buildup in propionyl-CoA in the mitochondria.  Such a buildup can lead to a disruption of the esterified CoA:free CoA ratio and ultimately to mitochondrial toxicity. Detoxification of these metabolic end products occurs via the transfer of the propionyl moiety to carnitine-forming propionyl-carnitine, which is then transferred across the inner mitochondrial membrane. 3-Hydroxypropionic acid is then released as the free acid. As an industrial chemical, it is used in the production of various chemicals such as acrylates in industry. When present in sufficiently high levels, 3-hydroxypropionic acid can act as an acidogen and a metabotoxin. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of hydroxypropionic acid are associated with many inborn errors of metabolism including biotinidase deficiency, malonic aciduria, methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency, methylmalonic aciduria, methylmalonic aciduria due to cobalamin-related disorders, and propionic acidemia. Hydroxypropionic acid is an organic acid. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. Infants with acidosis have symptoms that include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart, liver, and kidney abnormalities, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of the IEMs mentioned above. Many affected children with organic acidemias experience intellectual disability or delayed development. In adults, acidosis or acidemia is characterized by headaches, confusion, feeling tired, tremors, sleepiness, and seizures. 3-Hydroxypropionic acid is also a microbial metabolite found in Escherichia, Klebsiella and Saccharomyces (PMID: 26360870 ).",HMDB0000700,OCCC(O)=O,C3H6O3,"1S/C3H6O3/c4-2-1-3(5)6/h4H,1-2H2,(H,5,6)",ALRHLSYJTWAHJZ-UHFFFAOYSA-N,3-hydroxypropanoic acid,-0.8035810240000001,16.02280713040642,90.0779,90.031694058,6.47e+02 g/l,-0.95,0.86,3,2,2,57.53,19.0453,8.150999882309067,hydroxypropionic acid,0,-1,-2.477742482637333,4.201252954149806,1,0,1,0,0,0,MDB00000375,"5291,5313,5350,5476"

244,4-Hydroxybutyric acid,"4-Hydroxybutyric acid (also known as gamma-hydroxybutyrate or GHB) is a precursor and a metabolite of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). GHB acts as a central nervous system (CNS) neuromodulator, mediating its effects through GABA and GHB-specific receptors, or by affecting dopamine transmission (PMID: 16620539 ). GHB occurs naturally in all mammals, but its function remains unknown. GHB is labeled as an illegal drug in most countries, but it also is used as a legal drug (Xyrem) in patients with narcolepsy. It is used illegally (under the street names juice, liquid ecstasy, or G) as an intoxicant for increasing athletic performance and as a date rape drug. In high doses, GHB inhibits the CNS, inducing sleep and inhibiting the respiratory drive. In lower doses, its euphoriant effect predominates (PMID: 17658710 ). When present in sufficiently high levels, 4-hydroxybutyric acid can act as an acidogen, a neurotoxin, and a metabotoxin. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A neurotoxin is a compound that adversely affects neural cells and tissues. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of 4-hydroxybutyric acid are associated with two inborn errors of metabolism: glutaric aciduria II and succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency (SSADH). SSADH deficiency leads to a 30-fold increase of GHB and a 2-4 fold increase of GABA in the brains of patients with SSADH deficiency as compared to normal brain concentrations of the compounds. As an acidogen, 4-hydroxybutyric acid is an organic acid, and abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart abnormalities, kidney abnormalities, liver damage, seizures, coma, and possibly death. Many affected children with organic acidemias experience intellectual disability or delayed development. These are also the characteristic symptoms of the untreated IEMs mentioned above. Particularly for SSADH deficiency, the most common features observed include developmental delay, hypotonia, and intellectual disability. Nearly half of patients exhibit ataxia, seizures, behaviour problems, and hyporeflexia. In adults, acidosis or acidemia is characterized by headaches, confusion, feeling tired, tremors, sleepiness, and seizures. As a neurotoxin, GHB appears to affect both GABA (a neurotransmitter) signaling and glutamate signaling (another neurotransmitter). Glutamine metabolism may also play a role in the pathophysiology of excessive levels of GHB. High levels of GHB have been shown to depress both the NMDA and AMPA/kainite receptor-mediated functions and may also alter glutamatergic excitatory synaptic transmission as well. 4-Hydroxybutyric acid is a microbial metabolite found in Aeromonas, Escherichia and Pseudomonas (PMID: 19434404 ).",HMDB0000710,OCCCC(O)=O,C4H8O3,"1S/C4H8O3/c5-3-1-2-4(6)7/h5H,1-3H2,(H,6,7)",SJZRECIVHVDYJC-UHFFFAOYSA-N,4-hydroxybutanoic acid,-0.5149198190000002,15.98255965448772,104.1045,104.047344122,4.94e+02 g/l,-0.63,0.68,3,2,3,57.53,23.800299999999996,10.166134903961725,gamma hydroxybutyric acid,0,-1,-2.3817124873466886,4.440873954984472,1,0,1,0,0,0,MDB00000383,"5180,5379"
245,Hippuric acid,"Hippuric acid is an acyl glycine formed from the conjugation of benzoic acid with glycine. Acyl glycines are produced through the action of glycine N-acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.13) which is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction: acyl-CoA + glycine < -- > CoA + N-acylglycine. Hippuric acid is a normal component of urine and is typically increased with increased consμMption of phenolic compounds (tea, wine, fruit juices). These phenols are converted into benzoic acid which is then converted into hippuric acid and excreted in the urine. Hippuric acid is the most frequently used biomarker in the biological monitoring of occupational exposure to toluene. This product of solvent biotransformation may be also found in the urine of individuals who have not been exposed to the solvent. A smaller fraction of the absorbed toluene is oxidized into aromatic compounds including ortho-cresol, which is not found in the urine of non exposed individuals in a significant amount. The concentration of hippuric acid in the urine of individuals exposed to a low toluene concentration does not differ from that of individuals not exposed to the solvent. This has led to the conclusion that hippuric acid should not be utilized in the biological monitoring of occupational exposure to low levels of toluene in the air. Hippuric acid is an endogenous phenolic acid metabolite detected after the consμMption of whole grain. Protein-bound organic acids such as hippuric acid are markedly accμMulated in uremic plasma and produce defective protein binding of drugs (PMID: 9120876 , 8734460 ). Hippuric acid has been identified as a uremic toxin according to the European Uremic Toxin Working Group (PMID: 22626821 ). Hippuric acid is also found to be associated with phenylketonuria, propionic acidemia, and tyrosinemia I, which are inborn errors of metabolism. In adults (.18 years old) with phenylketonuria, hippuric acid in the urine is significantly reduced at a concentration of 50.2 (45.8-54.6) μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 19551947) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 217.0 (28.0-610.0) μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 2702744). Similarly, in adults (>18 years old) with propionic acidemia, hippuric acid in the urine is elevated at a concentration of 99.8 +/- 11.8 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 19551947) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 42.8 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 21388201). In adults (>18 years old) with tyrosinemia I, hippuric acid is also elevated in the urine at a concentration of 108.3 +/- 3.4 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 19551947) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 42.8 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 21388201). Hippuric acid is also associated with Paraquat poisoning induced renal injury. Paraquat is a toxic chemical that is widely used as an herbicide (plant killer), primarily for weed and grass control. In adults (>18 years old) with paraquat poisoning, hippuric acid is significantly reduced in the urine at a concentration of 88.2 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 9625050) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 837.0 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID:  9625050). Hippuric acid is also associated with uremia where adults (>18 years old) with uremia have significantly elevated levels of hippuric acid in the blood at a concentration of 1379.888 +/- 625.698 μM (PMID: 12675874) compared to normal adults at a concentration of <27.933 μM (PMID: 12675874).",HMDB0000714,OC(=O)CNC(=O)C1=CC=CC=C1,C9H9NO3,"1S/C9H9NO3/c11-8(12)6-10-9(13)7-4-2-1-3-5-7/h1-5H,6H2,(H,10,13)(H,11,12)",QIAFMBKCNZACKA-UHFFFAOYSA-N,2-(phenylformamido)acetic acid,0.5255454843333334,15.086777361882415,179.1727,179.058243159,1.18e+00 g/l,0.23,-2.18,3,2,3,66.4,46.117700000000006,17.573850113167715,hippuric acid,0,-1,-1.3083417398569668,3.5912387558835803,1,1,1,1,0,0,MDB00000384,"5177,5206,5223,5236,5244,5264,5313,5399"
246,Kynurenic acid,"Kynurenic acid (KYNA) is a heterocyclic organic acid that is the product of tryptophan metabolism. It is a well-known endogenous antagonist of the glutamate ionotropic excitatory amino acid receptors N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), alpha amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid and kainate receptors and of the nicotinic cholinergic subtype alpha 7 receptors. The neuroprotective and anticonvulsive activities of KYNA have been demonstrated in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases. Because of KYNA's neuromodulatory character, its involvement has been speculatively linked to the pathogenesis of a number of neurological conditions including those in the ageing process. Different patterns of abnormalities in various stages of KYNA metabolism in the CNS have been reported in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. In HIV-1-infected patients and in patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis a marked rise of KYNA metabolism was seen. In the ageing process KYNA metabolism in the CNS of rats shows a characteristic pattern of changes throughout the lifespan. A marked increase of the KYNA content in the CNS occurs before the birth, followed by a dramatic decline on the day of birth. A low activity was seen during ontogenesis, and a slow and progressive enhancement occurs during maturation and ageing. This remarkable profile of KYNA metabolism alterations in the mammalian brain has been suggested to result from the development of the organisation of neuronal connections and synaptic plasticity, development of receptor recognition sites, maturation and ageing. There is significant evidence that KYNA can improve cognition and memory, but it has also been demonstrated that it interferes with working memory. Impairment of cognitive function in various neurodegenerative disorders is accompanied by profound reduction and/or elevation of KYNA metabolism. The view that enhancement of CNS KYNA levels could underlie cognitive decline is supported by the increased KYNA metabolism in Alzheimer's disease, by the increased KYNA metabolism in down's syndrome and the enhancement of KYNA function during the early stage of Huntington's disease. Kynurenic acid is the only endogenous N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist identified up to now, that mediates glutamatergic hypofunction. Schizophrenia is a disorder of dopaminergic neurotransmission, but modulation of the dopaminergic system by glutamatergic neurotransmission seems to play a key role. Despite the NMDA receptor antagonism, kynurenic acid also blocks, in lower doses, the nicotinergic acetylcholine receptor, i.e., increased kynurenic acid levels can explain psychotic symptoms and cognitive deterioration (PMID: 28187219). Kynurenic acid levels are described to be higher in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and in critical central nervous system (CNS) regions of schizophrenics as compared to controls (PMID: 17062375 , 16088227 ). KYNA has also been identified as a uremic toxin according to the European Uremic Toxin Working Group where abnormal levels correspond to a higher concentration (0.80 (0.40-1.2) uM) compared to controls (0.0019 (0.0017-0.0021) uM) (PMID: 22626821 ). KYNA has also shown to be clinically significant in severe malaria (PMID: 11865422, PMID: 12964115) where it is found to be in higher concentrations in the CSF compared to those without the disease.",HMDB0000715,OC(=O)C1=CC(=O)C2=CC=CC=C2N1,C10H7NO3,"1S/C10H7NO3/c12-9-5-8(10(13)14)11-7-4-2-1-3-6(7)9/h1-5H,(H,11,12)(H,13,14)",HCZHHEIFKROPDY-UHFFFAOYSA-N,"4-oxo-1,4-dihydroquinoline-2-carboxylic acid",1.5775564513333333,11.430451481237121,189.1675,189.042593095,9.54e-01 g/l,1.16,-2.30,4,2,1,66.4,52.324000000000005,18.04775467429836,"acid, kynurenic",0,-1,-4.369517156660836,3.1660666326673232,1,2,1,1,0,0,MDB00000385,"5244,5245,5488"
247,Isovaleric acid,"Isovaleric acid, also known as 3-methylbutanoic acid, is a natural fatty acid found in a wide variety of plants and essential oils. It is a catabolic breakdown product arising from leucine. It is found in foods such as cheese, soy milk, and apple juice. Isovaleric acid has a strong pungent cheesy or sweaty smell. It is a major component of the cause of intense foot odor, as it is produced by skin bacteria metabolizing leucine. Isovaleric acid exists aws clear colorless liquid that is sparingly soluble in water, but is very soluble in most common organic solvents. It has been suggested that isovaleric acid from pilot whales, a species frequently consumed in the Faroe Islands, may be the unusual dietary factor in prolonged gestation in the population of the Faroe Islands (PMID: 2646392). Previous studies suggested that was due to the high intake of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids has been, but fatty acid data for eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexanoic acid (DHA) in blood lipids of Faroese and Norwegians was reviewed in terms of the type of fish eaten (mostly lean white fish with DHA much greater than EPA); the popular lean fish, thus, probably provides too little EPA to produce a marked effect on human biochemistry. (PMID 2646392). Isovaleric acid has been found to be associated with isovaleric acidemia, which is an inborn error of metabolism. Isovaleric acidemia is a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder which disrupts or prevents normal metabolism of the branched-chain amino acid leucine. signs and symptoms of this disorder become apparent within a few days after birth and include poor feeding, vomiting, seizures, and lack of energy that can progress to coma.",HMDB0000718,CC(C)CC(O)=O,C5H10O2,"1S/C5H10O2/c1-4(2)3-5(6)7/h4H,3H2,1-2H3,(H,6,7)",GWYFCOCPABKNJV-UHFFFAOYSA-N,3-methylbutanoic acid,1.208777894,,102.1317,102.068079564,6.49e+01 g/l,1.26,-0.20,2,1,2,37.3,26.4202,10.986666365215886,isovaleric acid,0,-1,,5.01023295557517,1,0,1,0,1,0,MDB00000387,"5202,5213,5256,5273,5312"
248,L-Homoserine,"Homoserine is a non-proteinogenic alpha amino acid. It is a more reactive variant of the amino acid serine. In homoserine, the hydroxyl side chain contains an additional CH2 group which brings the hydroxyl group closer to its own carboxyl group, allowing it to chemically react to form a five-membered ring. This occurs at the point that amino acids normally join to their neighbours in a peptide bond.  Homoserine is therefore unsuitable for forming proteins and has been eliminated from the repertoire of amino acids used by living things. Homoserine is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of three essential amino acids: methionine, threonine (an isomer of homoserine), and isoleucine.

250,Hydroxyproline,"4-Hydroxyproline (hydroxyproline or Hyp) is a major component of the protein collagen. Hydroxyproline is produced by hydroxylation of the amino acid proline and is, therefore, a post-translationally modified, non-essential amino acid. Hydroxyproline and proline play key roles in collagen stability. In particular, they permit the sharp twisting of the collagen helix. Hydroxyproline is found in few proteins other than collagen. The only other mammalian protein which includes hydroxyproline is elastin. For this reason, hydroxyproline content has been used as an indicator to determine collagen and/or gelatin amount in tissue or biological samples. Increased serum and urine levels of hydroxyproline have been found in Paget's disease (PMID: 436278). Hydroxyproline (Hyp) content in biological fluids is used as a parameter of collagen catabolism, especially bone resorption or tissue degradation. Bedridden and elderly individuals show significantly elevated serum levels of hydroxyproline in comparison to normal, active individuals (PMID: 10706420). Elevated levels of urinary hydroxyproline are also indicative of muscle damage (PMID: 21988268 ). Increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) are also known to accelerate collagen degradation. Hydroxyproline levels increase in cases of depression and stress (PMID: 21483218 ). 4-Hydroxyproline is found to be associated with Alzheimer's disease, and also hydroxyprolinemia and iminoglycinuria which are both inborn errors of metabolism. 4-Hydroxyproline is also involved in metabolic disorders such as hyperprolinemia type I, hyperornithinemia with gyrate atrophy (HOGA), L-arginine:glycine amidinotransferase deficiency, creatine deficiency, and guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency.

254,Lactulose,"Lactulose is a non-absorbable,  synthetic disaccharide used in the treatment of constipation. Lactulose is made from galactose and glucose. It is classified as an osmotic laxative. Lactulose is not absorbed in the small intestine nor broken down by human enzymes, thus stays in the digestive bolus through most of its course, causing retention of water through osmosis leading to softer, easier-to-pass stool. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Lactulose is useful in treating high blood ammonia, which can lead to hepatic encephalopathy. Lactulose helps trap the ammonia (NH3) in the colon and bind to it. It does this by using gut flora to acidify the colon, transforming the freely diffusible ammonia into ammonium ions (NH+4), which can no longer diffuse back into the blood.

255,Homocysteine,"Homocysteine (CAS: 454-29-5) is a sulfur-containing amino acid that arises during methionine metabolism. Although its concentration in plasma is only about 10 micromolar (uM), even moderate hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with an increased incidence of cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer's disease. Elevations in plasma homocysteine are commonly found as a result of vitamin deficiencies, polymorphisms of enzymes of methionine metabolism, and renal disease. It has been identified as a uremic toxin according to the European Uremic Toxin Working Group (PMID: 22626821 ). Pyridoxal, folic acid, riboflavin, and vitamin B(12) are all required for methionine metabolism, and deficiency of each of these vitamins result in elevated plasma homocysteine. A polymorphism of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (C677T), which is quite common in most populations with a homozygosity rate of 10-15 %, is associated with moderate hyperhomocysteinemia, especially in the context of marginal folate intake. Plasma homocysteine is inversely related to plasma creatinine in patients with renal disease. This is due to an impairment in homocysteine removal in renal disease. The role of these factors, and of modifiable lifestyle factors, in affecting methionine metabolism and in determining plasma homocysteine levels is discussed. Homocysteine is an independent cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor modifiable by nutrition and possibly exercise. Homocysteine was first identified as an important biological compound in 1932 and linked with human disease in 1962 when elevated urinary homocysteine levels were found in children with mental retardation. This condition, called homocystinuria, was later associated with premature occlusive CVD, even in children. Specifically, in adults (>18 years old) with homocystinuria, homocysteine is shown to be reduced in the blood at a concentration of 6.00 (4.8-7.40) μM (MetaGene) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 9.8 (7.6-14.9) μM (PMID: 11380830). These observations led to research investigating the relationship of elevated homocysteine levels and CVD in a wide variety of populations including middle age and elderly men and women with and without traditional risk factors for CVD (PMID: 17136938 , 15630149 ). Moreover, homocysteine is found to be associated with cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency, cystathioninuria, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency, and sulfite oxidase deficiency, which are inborn errors of metabolism. In children (1-13 years old) with cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency, homocysteine in the blood is significantly elevated at a concentration of 125.00 (50.00-200.00) μM (MetaGene) compared to normal children at a concentration of 10.4 +/- 2.3 μM (PMID: 9554495). Similarly, in children (1-13 years old) with cystathioninuria, homocysteine is significantly elevated in the blood at a concentration of 20.5 μM (PMID: 20584029) compared to normal children at a concentration of 10.4 +/- 2.3 μM (PMID: 9554495). In adults (>18 years old) with methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency, homocysteine is elevated in the blood at a concentration of 180 μM (PMID: 8456826) compared to normal adults at a concentration of <20 μM (PMID: 8456826).",HMDB0000742,NC(CCS)C(O)=O,C4H9NO2S,"1S/C4H9NO2S/c5-3(1-2-8)4(6)7/h3,8H,1-2,5H2,(H,6,7)",FFFHZYDWPBMWHY-UHFFFAOYSA-N,(2S)-2-amino-4-sulfanylbutanoic acid,-2.5764673824810185,10.279400411474743,135.185,135.035399227,1.48e+01 g/l,-2.29,-0.96,3,3,3,63.32,32.934999999999995,13.536000221060835,L-homocysteine,0,0,9.413365429707895,2.458553724459435,1,0,1,0,0,0,MDB00000402,"5172,5186,5211,5219,5225,5244,5250,5270,5276,5283,5286,5292,5302,5420,5500,5526"
256,Hydroxyisocaproic acid,"Hydroxyisocaproic acid is an end product of leucine metabolism in human tissues such as muscle and connective tissue. It belongs to 2-hydroxycarboxylic acid group of amino acid metabolites (PMID 6434570). Hydroxyisocaproic acid functions as an “anti-catabolite” and is widely used in the body building community. Chronic alpha-hydroxyisocaproic acid treatment of rats has been shown to improve muscle recovery after immobilization-induced atrophy (PMID: 23757407). Additionally, a 4-week hydroxyisocaproic acid supplementation of 1.5 g a day was shown to lead to increases in muscle mass during an intensive training period among soccer athletes (PMID: 20051111). Hydroxyisocaproic acid has also shown some potential as a topical antibiotic (PMID: 22483561). Elevated levels of 2-hydroxyisocaproic acid have been found in the urine of patients with dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3) deficiency (PMID: 6688766). Hydroxyisocaproic acid is also elevated in maple syrup urine disease, a genetic disorder, and has been shown to accelerate lipid peroxidation.

257,Methylglutaric acid,"Methylglutaric acid, also known as 3-methylglutaric acid or 3MG is a leucine metabolite. It is a C6 dicarboxylic acid that is associated with two distinct leucine pathway enzyme deficiencies, namely 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG) CoA lyase (HMGCL) deficiency and 3-methylglutaconyl CoA hydratase (AUH) deficiency. A large amount of 3-methylglutaric acid has been identified in the urine of patients with 3-methylglutaconyl coenzyme A hydratase deficiencies (PMID 6181239). 3MG is also found in a number of other inborn errors of metabolism. The occurrence of 3MG aciduria in a host of unrelated inborn errors of metabolism associated with compromised mitochondrial energy metabolism has been puzzling for a number of years. Recently, a novel mitochondrial biosynthetic pathway termed “the acetyl CoA diversion pathway”, has been proposed. This pathway is initiated by defective electron transport chain function which, ultimately, inhibits acetyl CoA entry into the TCA cycle. When this occurs, 3MG acid is synthesized in five steps from acetyl CoA via a novel reaction sequence (PMID: 31730811).",HMDB0000752,CC(CC(O)=O)CC(O)=O,C6H10O4,"1S/C6H10O4/c1-4(2-5(7)8)3-6(9)10/h4H,2-3H2,1H3,(H,7,8)(H,9,10)",XJMMNTGIMDZPMU-UHFFFAOYSA-N,3-methylpentanedioic acid,0.3331047939999997,4.694332576440712,146.1412,146.057908808,3.69e+01 g/l,0.33,-0.60,4,2,4,74.6,32.6866,13.87828651210858,methylglutaric acid,0,-2,,3.9135664414162874,1,0,1,0,0,0,MDB00000408,"5359,5434"
258,3-Hydroxyisovaleric acid,"3-Hydroxyisovaleric acid is a 3-hydroxy monocarboxylic acid that is isovaleric acid substituted at position 3 by a hydroxy group. It is a normal human metabolite excreted in the urine. It is a byproduct of the leucine degradation pathway. Production of 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid begins with the conversion of 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA into 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA in the mitochondria by the biotin-dependent enzyme methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase. Biotin deficiencies, certain lifestyle habits (smoking), or specific genetic conditions can reduce methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase activity. This reduction can lead to a buildup of 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA, which is converted into 3-hydroxyisovaleryl-CoA by the enzyme enoyl-CoA hydratase. Increased concentrations of 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA and 3-hydroxyisovaleryl-CoA can lead to a disruption of the esterified CoA:free CoA ratio, and ultimately to mitochondrial toxicity. Detoxification of these metabolic end products occur via the transfer of the 3-hydroxyisovaleryl moiety to carnitine forming 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid-carnitine or 3HIA-carnitine, which is then transferred across the inner mitochondrial membrane where 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid is released as the free acid (PMID: 21918059). 3-Hydroxyisovaleric acid has been found to be elevated in smokers and in subjects undergoing long-term anticonvulsant therapy with carbamazepine and/or phenytoin. These levels are elevated due to impairment of renal reclamation of biotin. Levels may also be increased from prolonged consumption of raw egg-whites (PMID: 16895887, 9523856 , 15447901 , 9176832 ) (OMIM: 210210 , 253270 , 600529 , 253260 , 246450 , 210200 , 238331 ). When present in sufficiently high levels, 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid can act as an acidogen and a metabotoxin. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid are associated with at least a dozen inborn errors of metabolism, including 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency, 3-methylglutaconic aciduria type I, biotinidase deficiency and isovaleric aciduria, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase deficiency, 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase 1 deficiency, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency, late-onset multiple carboxylase deficiency, holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency, and 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase 2 deficiency. 3-Hydroxyisovaleric acid is an organic acid. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart, liver, and kidney abnormalities, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of the untreated IEMs mentioned above. Many affected children with organic acidemias experience intellectual disability or delayed development. In adults, acidosis or acidemia is characterized by headaches, confusion, feeling tired, tremors, sleepiness, and seizures.",HMDB0000754,CC(C)(O)CC(O)=O,C5H10O3,"1S/C5H10O3/c1-5(2,8)3-4(6)7/h8H,3H2,1-2H3,(H,6,7)",AXFYFNCPONWUHW-UHFFFAOYSA-N,3-hydroxy-3-methylbutanoic acid,-0.10642933099999986,15.417396678218886,118.1311,118.062994186,3.84e+02 g/l,-0.12,0.51,3,2,2,57.53,28.1023,11.74803117886822,3-hydroxyisovaleric acid,0,-1,-2.7419355220135504,4.554638714853443,1,0,1,0,0,0,MDB00000409,"5199,5304,5338,5350,5359,5418,5440,5456,5459"
259,L-Hexanoylcarnitine,"L-Hexanoylcarnitine, also called C6, is an acylcarnitine. Numerous disorders have been described that lead to disturbances in energy production and in intermediary metabolism in the organism which are characterized by the production and excretion of unusual acylcarnitines. A mutation in the gene coding for carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase or the OCTN2 transporter aetiologically causes a carnitine deficiency that results in poor intestinal absorption of dietary L-carnitine, its impaired reabsorption by the kidney and, consequently, in increased urinary loss of L-carnitine. Determination of the qualitative pattern of acylcarnitines can be of diagnostic and therapeutic importance. The betaine structure of carnitine requires special analytical procedures for recording. The ionic nature of L-carnitine causes a high water solubility which decreases with increasing chain length of the ester group in the acylcarnitines. Therefore, the distribution of L-carnitine and acylcarnitines in various organs is defined by their function and their physico-chemical properties as well. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) permits screening for free and total carnitine, as well as complete quantitative acylcarnitine determination, including the long-chain acylcarnitine profile.

260,Lithocholic acid,"Lithocholic acid is a secondary bile acid formed from chenodeoxycholate by bacterial action, usually conjugated with glycine or taurine. It acts as a detergent to solubilize fats for absorption and is itself absorbed. It is used as cholagogue and choleretic. Bile acids are steroid acids found predominantly in bile of mammals. The distinction between different bile acids is minute, depends only on presence or absence of hydroxyl groups on positions 3, 7, and 12. - Bile acids are physiological detergents that facilitate excretion, absorption, and transport of fats and sterols in the intestine and liver. Bile acids are also steroidal amphipathic molecules derived from the catabolism of cholesterol. They modulate bile flow and lipid secretion, are essential for the absorption of dietary fats and vitamins and have been implicated in the regulation of all the key enzymes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Bile acids recirculate through the liver, bile ducts, small intestine and portal vein to form an enterohepatic circuit. They exist as anions at physiological pH and, consequently, require a carrier for transport across the membranes of the enterohepatic tissues. The unique detergent properties of bile acids are essential for the digestion and intestinal absorption of hydrophobic nutrients. Bile acids have potent toxic properties (e.g., membrane disruption) and there are a plethora of mechanisms to limit their accumulation in blood and tissues.

Indole-3-acetic acid derivatives are compounds containing an acetic acid (or a derivative) linked to the C3 carbon atom of an indole. 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid exists in all living organisms, ranging from bacteria to humans. In humans, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid is a breakdown product of serotonin that is excreted in the urine and it also participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid can be biosynthesized from 5-hydroxyindoleacetaldehyde; which is catalyzed by the mitochondrial enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase. In addition, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and S-adenosylmethionine can be converted into 5-methoxyindoleacetate and S-adenosylhomocysteine through its interaction with the enzyme acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase. 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid is also involved in the metabolism of tryptophan. 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid has been found to be associated with several human diseases such as brunner syndrome, friedreich's ataxia, schizophrenia, and olivopontocerebral atrophy. In adults (>18 years old) with brunner syndrome, 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid is elevated in the urine at a concentration of 0.8-1.4 umol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 8503438) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 0.3-5.1 umol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 8503438).

263,Mannitol,"Mannitol is a polyol. It is used as a diuretic and renal diagnostic aid related to sorbitol. It has little significant energy value as it is largely eliminated from the body before any metabolism can take place. It can be used to treat oliguria associated with kidney failure or other manifestations of inadequate renal function and has been used for determination of glomerular filtration rate. Mannitol is also commonly used as a research tool in cell biological studies, usually to control osmolarity.; Chemically, mannitol is an alcohol and a sugar, or a polyol; it is similar to xylitol or sorbitol.

264,Pseudouridine,"Pseudouridine, also known as psi-uridine or 5-ribosyluracil, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as nucleoside and nucleotide analogues. These are analogues of nucleosides and nucleotides such as phosphonated nucleosides, C-glycosylated nucleoside bases, analogues where the sugar unit is a pyranose, and carbocyclic nucleosides. Pseudouridine is the C-glycoside isomer of the nucleoside uridine, and it is the most prevalent of the over one hundred different modified nucleosides found in RNA. Pseudouridine is found in all species and in all classes of RNA except mRNA.

265,Phenyllactic acid,"3-phenyllactic acid or phenyllactic acid is a 2-hydroxy monocarboxylic acid that is lactic acid in which one of the methyl hydrogens is substituted by a phenyl group. Phenyllactic acid a product of phenylalanine catabolism, appearing prominently in the urine in individuals with phenylketonuria (PKU). Levels of several phenylalanine metabolites, including phenylacetate (PAA), phenyllactate (PLA), and phenylpyruvate (PPA)) are elevated in Phenylketonuria (PKU) (OMIM 261600). Phenyllactic acid is likely produced from phenylpyruvate via the action of lactate dehydrogenase. The D-form of this organic acid is typically derived from bacterial sources while the L-form is almost certainly endogenous. Levels of phenyllactate are normally very low in blood or urine. High levels of PLA in the urine or blood are often indicative of phenylketonuria (PKU) and hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA). PKU is due to lack of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), so that phenylalanine is converted not to tyrosine but to phenylpyruvic acid (a precursor of phenylactate). In particular, excessive phenylalanine is typically metabolized into phenylketones through, a transaminase pathway route involving glutamate. Metabolites of this transamination reaction include phenylacetate, phenylpyruvate and phenethylamine. In persons with PKU, dietary phenylalanine either accumulates in the body or some of it is converted to phenylpyruvic acid and then to phenyllactate through the action of lactate dehydrogenase. Individuals with PKU tend to excrete large quantities of phenylpyruvate, phenylacetate and phenyllactate, along with phenylalanine, in their urine. If untreated, mental retardation effects and microcephaly are evident by the first year along with other symptoms which include: unusual irritability, epileptic seizures and skin lesions. Hyperactivity, EEG abnormalities and seizures, and severe learning disabilities are major clinical problems later in life. A ""musty or mousy"" odor of skin, hair, sweat and urine (due to phenylacetate accumulation); and a tendency to hypopigmentation and eczema are also observed. The neural-development effects of PKU are primarily due to the disruption of neurotransmitter synthesis. In particular, phenylalanine is a large, neutral amino acid which moves across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) via the large neutral amino acid transporter (LNAAT). Excessive phenylalanine in the blood saturates the transporter. Thus, excessive levels of phenylalanine significantly decrease the levels of other LNAAs in the brain. But since these amino acids are required for protein and neurotransmitter synthesis, phenylalanine accumulation disrupts brain development, leading to mental retardation.

266,Azelaic acid,"Azelaic acid (AZA) is a naturally occurring saturated nine-carbon dicarboxylic acid (COOH (CH2)7-COOH). It possesses a variety of biological actions both in vitro and in vivo. Interest in the biological activity of AZA arose originally out of studies of skin surface lipids and the pathogenesis of hypochromia in pityriasis versicolor infection. Later, it was shown that Pityrosporum can oxidize unsaturated fatty acids to C8-C12 dicarboxylic acids that are cornpetitive inhibitors of tyrosinase in vitro. Azelaic acid was chosen for further investigation and development of a new topical drug for treating hyperpigmentary disorders for the following reasons: it possesses a middle-range of antityrosinase activity, is inexpensive, and more soluble to be incorporated into a base cream than other dicarboxylic acids. Azelaic acid is another option for the topical treatment of mild to moderate inflammatory acne vulgaris. It offers effectiveness similar to that of other agents without the systemic side effects of oral antibiotics or the allergic sensitization of topical benzoyl peroxide and with less irritation than tretinoin. Azelaic acid is less expensive than certain other prescription acne preparations, but it is much more expensive than nonprescription benzoyl peroxide preparations.

This enzyme catalyzes the eighth step in the biosynthesis of purine nucleotides. SAICAR (a ribotide) can lose its phosphate group leading to the appearance of a riboside known as succinylaminoimidazolecarboxamide riboside (SAICAriboside) in cerebrospinal fluid, in urine, and, to a lesser extent, in plasma. This particular riboside (called SAICAr) is characteristic of a heritable deficiency known as adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency (ADSL). On the other hand, the ribotide (SAICAR) is generally harmless and is an essential intermediate in purine metabolism. When present in sufficiently high levels, SAICAR can act as an oncometabolite. An oncometabolite is a compound that promotes tumour growth and survival. As an oncometabolite, high levels of SAICAR stimulate pyruvate kinase isoform M2 and promote cancer cell survival in glucose-limited conditions such as aerobic glycolysis (PMID: 23086999).",HMDB0000797,NC1=C(N=CN1[C@@H]1O[C@H](COP(O)(O)=O)[C@@H](O)[C@H]1O)C(=O)N[C@@H](CC(O)=O)C(O)=O,C13H19N4O12P,"1S/C13H19N4O12P/c14-10-7(11(22)16-4(13(23)24)1-6(18)19)15-3-17(10)12-9(21)8(20)5(29-12)2-28-30(25,26)27/h3-5,8-9,12,20-21H,1-2,14H2,(H,16,22)(H,18,19)(H,23,24)(H2,25,26,27)/t4-,5+,8+,9+,12+/m0/s1",NAQGHJTUZRHGAC-ZZZDFHIKSA-N,"(2S)-2-({5-amino-1-[(2R,3R,4S,5R)-3,4-dihydroxy-5-[(phosphonooxy)methyl]oxolan-2-yl]-1H-imidazol-4-yl}formamido)butanedioic acid",-4.825361675843606,2.997173380015799,454.2833,454.073708604,1.73e+00 g/l,-1.82,-2.42,13,8,9,263.98999999999995,90.65269999999998,38.50191613972262,saicar,0,-4,4.543300932982183,1.2173138245476895,0,2,0,0,0,0,MDB00000431,
272,Phytanic acid,"Phytanic acid (or 3,7,11,15-tetramethylhexadecanoic acid) is a 20-carbon branched-chain fatty acid that humans can obtain through the consumption of dairy products, ruminant animal fats, and certain fish. It is primarily formed by bacterial degradation of chlorophyll in the intestinal tract of ruminants. Unlike most fatty acids, phytanic acid cannot be metabolized by beta-oxidation (because of a methyl group in the beta position). Instead, it undergoes alpha-oxidation in the peroxisome, where it is converted into pristanic acid by the removal of one carbon. Pristanic acid can undergo several rounds of beta-oxidation in the peroxisome to form medium-chain fatty acids that can be converted into carbon dioxide and water in mitochondria. Refsum disease, an autosomal recessive neurological disorder caused by mutations in the PHYH gene, is characterized by having impaired alpha-oxidation activity. Individuals with Refsum disease accumulate large stores of phytanic acid in their blood and tissues. This frequently leads to peripheral polyneuropathy, cerebellar ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa, anosmia, and hearing loss. Therefore, chronically high levels of phytanic acid can be neurotoxic. Phytanic acid's neurotoxicity appears to lie in its ability to initiate astrocyte/neural cell death by activating the mitochondrial route of apoptosis. In particular, phytanic acid can induce the substantial generation of reactive oxygen species in isolated mitochondria as well as in intact cells.

274,N-Acetyl-L-aspartic acid,"N-Acetylaspartic acid is a derivative of aspartic acid. It is the second most concentrated molecule in the brain after the amino acid glutamate. It is synthesized in neurons from the amino acid aspartate and acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl CoA). The various functions served by N-acetylaspartic acid are still under investigation, but the primary proposed functions include (1) acting as a neuronal osmolyte that is involved in fluid balance in the brain, (2) serving as a source of acetate for lipid and myelin synthesis in oligodendrocytes (the glial cells that myelinate neuronal axons), (3) serving as a precursor for the synthesis of the important dipeptide neurotransmitter N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG), and (4) playing a potential role in energy production from the amino acid glutamate in neuronal mitochondria. High neurotransmitter levels can lead to abnormal neural signaling, delayed or arrested intellectual development, and difficulties with general motor skills. When present in sufficiently high levels, N-acetylaspartic acid can be a neurotoxin, an acidogen, and a metabotoxin. A neurotoxin is a compound that disrupts or attacks neural tissue. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of N-acetylaspartic acid are associated with Canavan disease. N-acetylaspartic acid is an organic acid. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. Infants with acidosis have symptoms that include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart abnormalities, seizures, coma, and possibly death. Many affected children with organic acidemias experience intellectual disability or delayed development. In adults, acidosis or acidemia is characterized by headaches, confusion, feeling tired, tremors, sleepiness, and flapping tremors.",HMDB0000812,CC(=O)N[C@@H](CC(O)=O)C(O)=O,C6H9NO5,"1S/C6H9NO5/c1-3(8)7-4(6(11)12)2-5(9)10/h4H,2H2,1H3,(H,7,8)(H,9,10)(H,11,12)/t4-/m0/s1",OTCCIMWXFLJLIA-BYPYZUCNSA-N,(2S)-2-acetamidobutanedioic acid,-1.4016766216666667,5.3336803807969115,175.1394,175.048072403,2.11e+01 g/l,-0.79,-0.92,5,3,4,103.69999999999999,35.9765,15.285189586226192,acetyl-L-aspartic acid,0,-2,-1.988558845428103,3.4130365160445932,1,0,1,0,0,0,MDB00000436,"5174,5176,5313"

279,Neopterin,"Neopterin, also known as monapterin, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as biopterins and derivatives. These are coenzymes containing a 2-amino-pteridine-4-one derivative. Neopterin is a catabolic product of guanosine triphosphate (GTP). In humans, neopterin is involved in pterine biosynthesis and it also serves as a precursor in the biosynthesis of biopterin. Neopterin has been identified as a uremic toxin according to the European Uremic Toxin Working Group (PMID: 22626821). Most uremic toxins are metabolic waste products and are normally excreted in the urine or feces.  Uremic toxins can cause kidney, liver and heart damage. They can also cause changes in mental status, such as confusion, reduced awareness, agitation, psychosis, seizures, and coma. Uremic toxins such as neopterin are actively transported into the kidneys via organic ion transporters (especially OAT3). Elevated levels of neopterin result from immune system activation, malignant disease, allograft rejection, and viral infections. Measurement of neopterin concentrations in body fluids like blood serum, cerebrospinal fluid or urine provides information about activation of cellular immune activation in humans under the control of T helper cells type 1. High neopterin production is associated with increased production of reactive oxygen species, neopterin concentrations also allow to estimate the extent of oxidative stress elicited by the immune system. Neopterin concentrations usually correlate with the extent and activity of a given disease, and are also used to monitor the course of the disease. Elevated neopterin concentrations are among the best predictors of adverse outcome in patients with HIV infection, in cardiovascular disease and in various types of cancer.

283,Pimelic acid,"Pimelic acid, also known as heptanedioic acid is a dicarboxylic acid. Derivatives of pimelic acid are involved in the biosynthesis of the amino acid called lysine. Pimelic acid is one methylene longer than a related dicarboxylic acid, adipic acid, a precursor to many polyesters and polyamides. Pimelic acid is essential for the synthesis of biotin (also called vitamin B7). Biotin is a heterocyclic, S-containing monocarboxylic acid that is made from two precursors, alanine and pimeloyl-CoA. Biotin is important in fatty acid synthesis, branched-chain amino acid catabolism, and gluconeogenesis. Biotin is found in a wide range of foods. Likewise, intestinal bacteria synthesize biotin, which is then absorbed by the host animal. Pimelic acid (which is the precursor for pimeloyl-CoA) is synthesized in many bacteria via a head-to-tail incorporation of acetate units through a modified fatty acid synthetic pathway using O-methyl esters disguised to resemble the canonical intermediates of the fatty acid synthetic pathway (PMID: 21435937 ). Some bacteria and yeast synthesize pimelic acid not by biosynthesis, but via cleavage of longer chain fatty acids (such as linolenic acid) via a cytochrome P450-like enzyme (PMID: 28196402 , 21435937 , 3236079 ).

In 2015 researchers reported a marked reduction of xanthurenic acid levels in the serum of patients with schizophrenia (PMID: 26643205). Xanthurenic acid (XA), interacts with, and activates mGlu2 and mGlu3 metabotropic glutamate receptors. It is also known to be a potent VGLUT inhibitor, thereby preventing the movement of glutamate from the cytoplasm into synaptic vesicles, an action that it mediates via competitive blockade of vesicular glutamate transporters.",HMDB0000881,OC(=O)C1=NC2=C(O)C=CC=C2C(O)=C1,C10H7NO4,"1S/C10H7NO4/c12-7-3-1-2-5-8(13)4-6(10(14)15)11-9(5)7/h1-4,12H,(H,11,13)(H,14,15)",FBZONXHGGPHHIY-UHFFFAOYSA-N,"4,8-dihydroxyquinoline-2-carboxylic acid",-0.16662861726590097,9.066086911279461,205.1669,205.037507717,1.63e+00 g/l,2.01,-2.10,5,3,1,90.65,50.8253,19.064003634931545,xanthurenic acid,0,-1,5.753313640791366,1.1352227807412834,1,2,1,1,0,0,MDB00000465,"5302,5313"
287,L-Valine,"Valine (Val) is a branched chain amino acid (BCAA). BCAAs include valine, isoleucine and leucine. Branched chain amino acids (BCAA) are essential amino acids whose carbon structure is marked by a branch point. BCAAs are critical to human life and are particularly involved in stress, energy and muscle metabolism. BCAA supplementation as therapy, both oral and intravenous, in human health and disease holds great promise.  Despite their structural similarities, the branched amino acids have different metabolic routes, with valine going solely to carbohydrates, leucine solely to fats and isoleucine to both. The different metabolism accounts for different requirements for these essential amino acids in humans: 12 mg/kg, 14 mg/kg and 16 mg/kg of valine, leucine and isoleucine respectively. Furthermore, these amino acids have different deficiency symptoms. Valine deficiency is marked by neurological defects in the brain, while isoleucine deficiency is marked by muscle tremors.' - Many types of inborn errors of BCAA metabolism exist, and are marked by various abnormalities. The most common form is the maple syrup urine disease, marked by a characteristic urinary odor. Other abnormalities are associated with a wide range of symptoms, such as mental retardation, ataxia, hypoglycemia, spinal muscle atrophy, rash, vomiting and excessive muscle movement. Most forms of BCAA metabolism errors are corrected by dietary restriction of BCAA and at least one form is correctable by supplementation with 10 mg of biotin daily. BCAA are decreased in patients with liver disease, such as hepatitis, hepatic coma, cirrhosis, extrahepatic biliary atresia or portacaval shunt; aromatic amino acids (AAA)-tyrosine, tryptophan and phenylalanine, as well as methionine-are increased in these conditions. Valine in particular, has been established as a useful supplemental therapy to the ailing liver. All the BCAA probably compete with AAA for absorption into the brain. Supplemental BCAA with vitamin B6 and zinc help normalize the BCAA:AAA ratio.

288,Valeric acid,"Valeric acid, or pentanoic acid, is a straight chain alkyl carboxylic acid with the chemical formula CH3(CH2)3COOH. Like other low molecular weight carboxylic acids, it has a very unpleasant odor. Valeric acid is commonly found in human feces, with an average concentration of 2.4 umol/g feces (range of 0.6-3.8 umol/g) (PMID: 6740214 ). Valeric acid is a produced by the gut microbiota, typically Clostridia species and other gut bacterial species such as Megasphaera massiliensis MRx0029 (PMID: 30052654 ) via the condensation of ethanol with propionic acid (PMID: 18116989 ). Valeric acid is largely considered as a gut microbial metabolite. Recently, valeric acid has been found to exert strong gut protective effects. Studies involving mice that received high doses of radiation showed that valeric acid replenishment (via oral gavage) elevated the survival rate of irradiated mice, protected hematogenic organs (such as the thymus and spleen), improved gastrointestinal (GI) tract function and enhanced intestinal epithelial integrity (PMID: 31931652 ). Valeric acid was also found to restore the enteric bacteria taxonomic proportions and reprogram the small intestinal protein profile to normal levels. Valeric acid, like butyric acid, also appears to be a potent histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. High levels of HDAC proteins have been implicated in a variety of disease pathologies, from cancer and colitis to cardiovascular disease and neurodegeneration (PMID: 30052654 ). Valeric acid is also found in certain plants, specifically in the perennial flowering plant valerian (Valeriana officinalis), from which it gets its name. Industrially valeric acid is primarily used is in the synthesis of its esters. Volatile esters of valeric acid tend to have pleasant odors and are used in perfumes and cosmetics. Ethyl valerate and pentyl valerate are used as food additives because of their fruity flavours. Hydrolysis of these valerate-containing food additives in the gut can also lead to the appearance of valerate in blood, urine and stool samples.",HMDB0000892,CCCCC(O)=O,C5H10O2,"1S/C5H10O2/c1-2-3-4-5(6)7/h2-4H2,1H3,(H,6,7)",NQPDZGIKBAWPEJ-UHFFFAOYSA-N,pentanoic acid,1.3663274626666666,,102.1317,102.068079564,4.03e+01 g/l,1.34,-0.40,2,1,3,37.3,26.4726,11.225059262005129,N-valeric acid,0,-1,,5.013807378650193,1,0,1,0,1,0,MDB00000469,5213

A metabolic breakdown product derived from oleic acid. Elevated levels of this unstaruated dicarboxylic acid are found in individuals with medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCAD). In children (1-13 years old) with MCAD, suberic acid in the urrine is elevated at a concentration of 25.962 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 2380628) 1.298 +/- 1.947 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 2380628). Suberic acid is also found to be associated with carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase deficiency, malonyl-Coa decarboxylase deficiency, which are also inborn errors of metabolism. In newborns (0-30 days old) with carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase deficiency, suberic acid is significantly elevated in the urine at a concentration of 74 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 1598097) compared to normal newborns at a concentration 7.0 (3.4-14.0) μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 8087979). Similarly, in infants (0-1 year old) with malonyl-Coa decarboxylase deficiency, suberic acid in the urine is elevated at a concentration of 54 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 3709568) compared to normal infants at a concentration of 1.8-5.0 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 31963255). Suberic acid, also octanedioic acid, is a dicarboxylic acid, with formula C6H12(COOH)2. Its name is derived from the Latin word suber which means cork.

290,Acetylcholine,"Acetylcholine (ACh) is a neurotransmitter. Acetylcholine in vertebrates is the major transmitter at neuromuscular junctions, autonomic ganglia, parasympathetic effector junctions, a subset of sympathetic effector junctions, and at many sites in the central nervous system. Its physiological and pharmacological effects, metabolism, release, and receptors have been well documented in several species. ACh has been considered an important excitatory neurotransmitter in the carotid body (CB). Various nicotinic and muscarinic ACh receptors are present in both afferent nerve endings and glomus cells. Therefore, ACh can depolarize or hyperpolarize the cell membrane depending on the available receptor type in the vicinity. Binding of ACh to its receptor can create a wide variety of cellular responses including opening cation channels (nicotinic ACh receptor activation), releasing Ca2+ from intracellular storage sites (via muscarinic ACh receptors), and modulating activities of K+ and Ca2+ channels. Interactions between ACh and other neurotransmitters (dopamine, adenosine, nitric oxide) have been known, and they may induce complicated responses. Cholinergic biology in the CB differs among species and even within the same species due to different genetic composition. Development and environment influence cholinergic biology. - Pharmacological data clearly indicate that both muscarinic and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors have a role in the encoding of new memories. Localized lesions and antagonist infusions demonstrate the anatomical locus of these cholinergic effects, and computational modeling links the function of cholinergic modulation to specific cellular effects within these regions. Acetylcholine has been shown to increase the strength of afferent input relative to feedback, to contribute to theta rhythm oscillations, activate intrinsic mechanisms for persistent spiking, and increase the modification of synapses. These effects might enhance different types of encoding in different cortical structures. In particular, the effects in entorhinal and perirhinal cortex and hippocampus might be important for encoding new episodic memories. The role of ACh in attention has been repeatedly demonstrated in several tasks. Acetylcholine is linked to response accuracy in voluntary and reflexive attention and also to response speed in reflexive attention. It is well known that those with Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders tend to be inaccurate and slow to respond.

292,Citrulline,"Citrulline, also known as Cit or δ-ureidonorvaline, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as l-alpha-amino acids. These are alpha amino acids which have the L-configuration of the alpha-carbon atom. Citrulline has the formula H2NC(O)NH(CH2)3CH(NH2)CO2H. Citrulline exists in all living species, ranging from bacteria to humans. Within humans, citrulline participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, citrulline can be biosynthesized from carbamoyl phosphate and ornithine which is catalyzed by the enzyme ornithine carbamoyltransferase. In addition, citrulline and L-aspartic acid can be converted into argininosuccinic acid through the action of the enzyme argininosuccinate synthase. In humans, citrulline is involved in the metabolic disorder called argininemia. Citrulline has also been found to be associated with several diseases such as ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and citrullinemia type II. Citrulline has also been linked to several inborn metabolic disorders including argininosuccinic aciduria and fumarase deficiency. Outside of the human body, citrulline is found, on average, in the highest concentration in a few different foods such as wheats, oats, and cucumbers and in a lower concentration in swiss chards, yellow wax beans, and potato. Citrulline has also been detected, but not quantified in several different foods, such as epazotes, lotus, common buckwheats, strawberry guava, and italian sweet red peppers. Citrulline is a potentially toxic compound. Proteins that normally contain citrulline residues include myelin basic protein (MBP), filaggrin, and several histone proteins, whereas other proteins, such as fibrin and vimentin are susceptible to citrullination during cell death and tissue inflammation. Citrulline is also produced as a byproduct of the enzymatic production of nitric oxide from the amino acid arginine, catalyzed by nitric oxide synthase. It is also produced from arginine as a byproduct of the reaction catalyzed by NOS family (NOS; EC1.14.13.39). Citrulline is associated with several diseases such as ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and citrullinemia type II. Circulating citrulline concentration is a biomarker of intestinal functionality (PMID: 29511548 ). In adults (>18 years old) with citrullinemia type II, citrulline is elevated in the blood at a concentration of 86-1542 μM (PMID: 18620775) compared to normal adults at a concentration of <43 μM (PMID: 18620775). Citrulline is also associated with permanent intestinal failure. In adults (>18 years old) with permanent intestinal failure, citrulline in the blood is significantly reduced at a concentration of 13.0 (6.0-20.0) μM (PMID: 11113071) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 38.0 (30.0-46.0) μM (PMID: 11113071). Citrulline has also been shown to be associated with argininosuccinic aciduria (ASL), a rare genetic disorder characterized by deficiency or lack of the enzyme argininosuccinate lyase. In infants (0-1 year old) with ASL, citrulline is reduced in the blood at a concentration of 284 μM (PMID: 12408190) compared to normal infants at a concentration of 19-51 μM (PMID: 12408190). Finally, citrulline has also shown association with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) where adults (>18 years old) with AD have a significantly elevated citrulline concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid at a concentration of 27.0 +/- 2.6 μM (PMID: 17031479) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 2.62 (1.35-3.89) μM (PMID: 12834252).",HMDB0000904,N[C@@H](CCCNC(N)=O)C(O)=O,C6H13N3O3,"1S/C6H13N3O3/c7-4(5(10)11)2-1-3-9-6(8)12/h4H,1-3,7H2,(H,10,11)(H3,8,9,12)/t4-/m0/s1",RHGKLRLOHDJJDR-BYPYZUCNSA-N,(2S)-2-amino-5-(carbamoylamino)pentanoic acid,-3.9319578381140263,15.333969157335531,175.1857,175.095691297,2.18e+01 g/l,-3.27,-0.90,4,4,5,118.43999999999998,41.329,17.34757818367823,L-citrulline,0,0,9.225134668659093,2.2682474980163243,1,0,1,0,0,0,MDB00000480,"5184,5185,5186,5224,5306,5394,5409,5413,5427,5489,5504,5505,5530,5536"
293,Trimethylamine,"Trimethylamine, also known as NMe3, N(CH3)3, and TMA, is a colorless, hygroscopic, and flammable simple amine with a typical fishy odor in low concentrations and an ammonia like odor in higher concentrations. Trimethylamine has a boiling point of 2.9 degrees Celsius and is a gas at room temperature. Trimethylamine usually comes in pressurized gas cylinders or as a 40% solution in water. Trimethylamine is a nitrogenous base and its positively charged cation is called trimethylammonium cation. A common salt of trimethylamine is trimethylammonium chloride, a hygroscopic colorless solid. Trimethylamine is a product of decomposition of plants and animals. It is the substance mainly responsible for the fishy odor often associated with fouling fish, bacterial vagina infections, and bad breath. It is also associated with taking large doses of choline. Trimethylaminuria is a genetic disorder in which the body is unable to metabolize trimethylamine from food sources. Patients develop a characteristic fish odour of their sweat, urine, and breath after the consumption of choline-rich foods.

296,Trimethylamine N-oxide,"Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is an oxidation product of trimethylamine and a common metabolite in animals and humans. In particular, trimethylamine-N-oxide is biosynthesized endogenously from trimethylamine, which is derived from choline, which can be derived from dietary lecithin (phosphatidylcholines) or dietary carnitine. TMAO decomposes to trimethylamine (TMA), which is the main odorant that is characteristic of degrading seafood. TMAO is an osmolyte that the body will use to counteract the effects of increased concentrations of urea (due to kidney failure) and high levels can be used as a biomarker for kidney problems. It has been identified as a uremic toxin according to the European Uremic Toxin Working Group (PMID: 22626821 ). Fish odor syndrome or trimethylaminuria is a defect in the production of the enzyme flavin containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3) causing incomplete breakdown of trimethylamine from choline-containing food into trimethylamine oxide. Trimethylamine then builds up and is released in the person's sweat, urine, and breath, giving off a strong fishy odor. The concentration of TMAO in the blood increases after consuming foods containing carnitine or lecithin (phosphatidylcholines), if the bacteria that convert those substances to TMAO are present in the gut (PMID: 23614584 ). High concentrations of carnitine are found in red meat, some energy drinks, and certain dietary supplements; lecithin is found in eggs and is commonly used as an ingredient in processed food. High levels of TMAO are found in many seafoods. Some types of normal gut bacteria (e.g. species of Acinetobacter) in the human gut convert dietary carnitine and dietary lecithin to TMAO (PMID: 21475195 ). TMAO alters cholesterol metabolism in the intestines, in the liver and in arterial wall. When TMAO is present, cholesterol metabolism is altered and there is an increased deposition of cholesterol within, and decreased removal of cholesterol from, peripheral cells such as those in the artery wall (PMID: 23563705 ). Urinary TMAO is a biomarker for the consumption of fish, especially cold-water fish. Trimethylamine N-oxide is found to be associated with maple syrup urine disease and propionic acidemia, which are inborn errors of metabolism. TMAO can be produced by gut bacteria, namely by members of Bacteroidetes and Ruminococcus (PMID: 26687352 ).",HMDB0000925,C[N+](C)(C)[O-],C3H9NO,"1S/C3H9NO/c1-4(2,3)5/h1-3H3",UYPYRKYUKCHHIB-UHFFFAOYSA-N,"N,N-dimethylmethanamine oxide",-0.9342057176666667,,75.1097,75.068413915,5.78e+01 g/l,-2.01,-0.11,1,0,0,23.06,22.033,8.40468714229359,trimethylamine-n-oxide,0,0,4.662869181288156,,1,0,1,0,1,0,MDB00000489,"5206,5223,5244,5263,5288,5304,5349,5499"
297,L-Tryptophan,"Tryptophan is an essential amino acid that is the precursor of both serotonin and melatonin. Melatonin is a hormone that is produced by the pineal gland in animals, which regulates sleep and wakefulness. Serotonin is a brain neurotransmitter, platelet clotting factor, and neurohormone found in organs throughout the body. Metabolism of tryptophan into serotonin requires nutrients such as vitamin B6, niacin, and glutathione. Niacin (also known as vitamin B3) is an important metabolite of tryptophan. It is synthesized via kynurenine and quinolinic acids, which are products of tryptophan degradation. There are a number of conditions or diseases that are characterized by tryptophan deficiencies. For instance, fructose malabsorption causes improper absorption of tryptophan in the intestine, which reduces levels of tryptophan in the blood and leads to depression. High corn or other tryptophan-deficient diets can cause pellagra, which is a niacin-tryptophan deficiency disease with symptoms of dermatitis, diarrhea, and dementia. Hartnup's disease is a disorder in which tryptophan and other amino acids are not absorbed properly. Symptoms of Hartnup's disease include skin rashes, difficulty coordinating movements (cerebellar ataxia), and psychiatric symptoms such as depression or psychosis. Tryptophan supplements may be useful for treating Hartnup's. Assessment of tryptophan deficiency is done through studying excretion of tryptophan metabolites in the urine or blood. Blood may be the most sensitive test because the amino acid tryptophan is transported in a unique way. Increased urination of tryptophan breakdown products (such as kynurenine) correlates with increased tryptophan degradation, which occurs with oral contraception, depression, mental retardation, hypertension, and anxiety states. The requirement for tryptophan and protein decreases with age. The minimum daily requirement for adults is 3 mg/kg/day or about 200 mg a day. There is 400 mg of tryptophan in a cup of wheat germ. A cup of low fat cottage cheese contains 300 mg of tryptophan and chicken and turkey contain up to 600 mg of tryptophan per pound (http://www.dcnutrition.com). Tryptophan plays a role in ""feast-induced"" drowsiness. Ingestion of a meal rich in carbohydrates triggers the release of insulin. Insulin, in turn, stimulates the uptake of large neutral branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) into muscle, increasing the ratio of tryptophan to BCAA in the bloodstream. The increased tryptophan ratio reduces competition at the large neutral amino acid transporter (which transports both BCAAs and tryptophan), resulting in greater uptake of tryptophan across the blood-brain barrier into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Once in the CSF, tryptophan is converted into serotonin and the resulting serotonin is further metabolized into melatonin by the pineal gland, which promotes sleep. Under certain situations, tryptophan can be a neurotoxin and a metabotoxin. A neurotoxin is a compound that causes damage to the brain and nerve tissues. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of tryptophan can be found in glutaric aciduria type I (glutaric acidemia type I or GA1). GA1 is an inherited disorder in which the body is unable to completely break down the amino acids lysine, hydroxylysine, and tryptophan due to a deficiency of mitochondrial glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.99.7, GCDH). Excessive levels of their intermediate breakdown products (e.g. glutaric acid, glutaryl-CoA, 3-hydroxyglutaric acid, glutaconic acid) can accumulate and cause damage to the brain (and also other organs), but particularly the basal ganglia. Babies with glutaric acidemia type I are often born with unusually large heads (macrocephaly). Other symptoms include spasticity (increased muscle tone/stiffness) and dystonia (involuntary muscle contractions resulting in abnormal movement or posture), but many affected individuals are asymptomatic. High levels of tryptophan have also been implicated in eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS), an incurable and sometimes fatal flu-like neurological condition linked to the ingestion of large amounts of L-tryptophan. The risk of developing EMS increases with larger doses of tryptophan and increasing age. Some research suggests that certain genetic polymorphisms may be related to the development of EMS. The presence of eosinophilia is a core feature of EMS, along with unusually severe myalgia (muscle pain). It is thought that both tryptophan and certain unidentified tryptophan contaminants may contribute to EMS (PMID: 1763543 ). It has also been suggested that excessive tryptophan or elevation of its metabolites could play a role in amplifying some of the pathological features of EMS (PMID: 10721094 ). This pathological damage is further augmented by metabolites of the kynurenine pathway (a tryptophan degradation pathway).",HMDB0000929,N[C@@H](CC1=CNC2=CC=CC=C12)C(O)=O,C11H12N2O2,"1S/C11H12N2O2/c12-9(11(14)15)5-7-6-13-10-4-2-1-3-8(7)10/h1-4,6,9,13H,5,12H2,(H,14,15)/t9-/m0/s1",QIVBCDIJIAJPQS-VIFPVBQESA-N,(2S)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid,-1.0854569138833579,16.1565885064574,204.2252,204.089877638,1.36e+00 g/l,-1.10,-2.18,3,3,3,79.11,56.20280000000001,21.047414013171778,L-tryptophan,0,0,9.396082567807317,2.5439286383469866,1,2,1,0,0,0,MDB00000490,"5183,5184,5185,5186,5204,5205,5215,5237,5269,5301,5305,5313,5331,5345,5402,5473,5533"

299,S-Adenosylhomocysteine,"S-Adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH) is an amino acid derivative consisting of adenosine linked to the amino acid homocysteine. It is formed by the demethylation of S-adenosyl-L-methionine. S-Adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy or SAH) is also the immediate precursor of all of the homocysteine produced in the body. The reaction is catalyzed by S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase and is reversible with the equilibrium favoring formation of SAH. In vivo, the reaction is driven in the direction of homocysteine formation by the action of the enzyme adenosine deaminase which converts the second product of the S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase reaction, adenosine, to inosine. Except for methyl transfer from betaine and from methylcobalamin in the methionine synthase reaction, SAH is the product of all methylation reactions that involve S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) as the methyl donor. Methylation is significant in epigenetic regulation of protein expression via DNA and histone methylation. The inhibition of these SAM-mediated processes by SAH is a proven mechanism for metabolic alteration. Because the conversion of SAH to homocysteine is reversible, with the equilibrium favoring the formation of SAH, increases in plasma homocysteine are accompanied by an elevation of SAH in most cases. Disturbances in the transmethylation pathway indicated by abnormal SAH levels, SAM levels, or their ratio have been reported in many neurodegenerative diseases, such as dementia, depression, and Parkinson's disease (PMID: 18065573 , 17892439 ). Therefore, when present in sufficiently high levels, S-adenosylhomocysteine can act as an immunotoxin and a metabotoxin. An immunotoxin disrupts, limits the function, or destroys immune cells. A metabotoxin is an endogenous metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of S-adenosylhomocysteine are associated with S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) hydrolase deficiency and adenosine deaminase deficiency. S-Adenosylhomocysteine forms when there are elevated levels of homocysteine and adenosine. S-Adenosyl-L-homocysteine is a potent inhibitor of S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methylation reactions. It is toxic to immature lymphocytes and can lead to immunosuppression (PMID: 221926 ).",HMDB0000939,N[C@@H](CCSC[C@H]1O[C@H]([C@H](O)[C@@H]1O)N1C=NC2=C(N)N=CN=C12)C(O)=O,C14H20N6O5S,"1S/C14H20N6O5S/c15-6(14(23)24)1-2-26-3-7-9(21)10(22)13(25-7)20-5-19-8-11(16)17-4-18-12(8)20/h4-7,9-10,13,21-22H,1-3,15H2,(H,23,24)(H2,16,17,18)/t6-,7+,9+,10+,13+/m0/s1",ZJUKTBDSGOFHSH-WFMPWKQPSA-N,"(2S)-2-amino-4-({[(2S,3S,4R,5R)-5-(6-amino-9H-purin-9-yl)-3,4-dihydroxyoxolan-2-yl]methyl}sulfanyl)butanoic acid",-4.023439604751099,12.472280035523099,384.411,384.12158847,4.08e+00 g/l,-2.37,-1.97,10,5,7,182.63000000000005,92.7235,38.405820699013795,S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine,0,0,9.501849806722712,1.8086867060766885,1,3,1,0,0,1,MDB00000493,"5186,5225,5463,5464"

Dihydroxy bile acids, alcohols and derivatives are compounds containing or derived from a bile acid or bile alcohol, and which bears exactly two carboxylic acid groups. Ursodeoxycholic acid is an epimer of chenodeoxycholic acid. It is a secondary bile acid, produced in humans and most other mammalian species from metabolism by intestinal bacteria. Primary bile acids are produced by the liver and stored in the gall bladder. When secreted into the intestine, primary bile acids can be metabolized into secondary bile acids by intestinal bacteria. Primary and secondary bile acids help the body digest fats. Ursodeoxycholic acid, which is a secondary bile acid helps regulate cholesterol by reducing the rate at which the intestine absorbs cholesterol molecules while breaking up micelles containing cholesterol. UDCA was first found in bear bile and is apparently either a precursor or a product of chenodeoxycholate. UDCA is used as a drug. Its administration changes the composition of bile and may dissolve gallstones. It is used as a cholagogue and choleretic.

303,Tartaric acid,"Tartaric acid is a dihydroxy derivative of dicarboxylic acid. It exists as a white crystalline solid. Naturally-occurring tartaric acid is chiral, meaning that it has molecules that are non-superimposable on their mirror-images. It is a useful raw material in organic chemistry for the synthesis of other chiral molecules. The naturally occurring form of the acid is L-(+)-tartaric acid or dextrotartaric acid. The mirror-image (enantiomeric) form, levotartaric acid or D-(-)-tartaric acid, and the achiral form, mesotartaric acid, can be made artificially.  Tartaric acid occurs naturally in many plants, particularly grapes and tamarinds, and is one of the main acids found in wine. It is added to other foods to give a sour taste. It is also used as an antioxidant. Salts of tartaric acid are known as tartrates. Tartaric acid is a muscle toxin, which works by inhibiting the production of malic acid, and in high doses causes paralysis and death. The minimum recorded fatal dose for a human is about 12 grams. In spite of its potential toxicity, tartarate is included in many foods, especially sour-tasting sweets. As a food additive, tartaric acid is used as an antioxidant with E number E334. Tartarate is believed to play a role in inhibiting kidney stone formation. Most tartarate that is consumed by humans is metabolized by bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract -- primarily in the large intestine. Only about 15-20% of consumed tartaric acid is secreted in the urine unchanged.↵",HMDB0000956,O[C@H]([C@@H](O)C(O)=O)C(O)=O,C4H6O6,"1S/C4H6O6/c5-1(3(7)8)2(6)4(9)10/h1-2,5-6H,(H,7,8)(H,9,10)/t1-,2-/m1/s1",FEWJPZIEWOKRBE-JCYAYHJZSA-N,"(2R,3R)-2,3-dihydroxybutanedioic acid",-1.8287998886666665,4.792876457889947,150.0868,150.016437924,1.61e+02 g/l,-1.27,0.03,6,4,3,115.06,26.2134,11.327063324959603,L(+)-tartaric acid,0,-2,-4.330574673439462,2.719041003817166,1,0,1,0,0,0,MDB00000502,5304

305,Tiglylglycine,"Tiglylglycine is an acyl glycine. Acyl glycines are normally minor metabolites of fatty acids. However, the excretion of certain acyl glycines is increased in several inborn errors of metabolism. In certain cases the measurement of these metabolites in body fluids can be used to diagnose disorders associated with mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation. Acyl glycines are produced through the action of glycine N-acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.13) which is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction: acyl-CoA + glycine < -- > CoA + N-acylglycine. Tiglylglycine is an intermediate product of the catabolism of isoleucine. An elevated level of tiglylglycine is identified in urine of patients with beta-ketothiolase deficiency or with disorders of propionate metabolism (PMID 7923765 ). In children (1-13 years old) with  beta-ketothiolase deficiency, tiglylglycine is elevated in the urine at a concentration of 6.7-45.8 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 23430882) compared to normal children at a concentration of 2.5 (0.1-6.7) μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 8087979). Similarly, in adults (>18 years old) with propionic acidemia, tiglylglycine is reduced in the urine at a concentration of 6.44 μmol/mmol creatinine compared to normal adults at a concentration of <7 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 28853722). Tiglyglycine is a biomarker for the consumption of cheese. Tiglyglycine is also associated with 2-Methyl-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, a rare X-linked disorder associated with the accumulation of 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyric acid in body fluids due to abnormal activity of MHBDD which is involved in isoleucine degradation (PMID: 30013934). In children (1-13 years old) with 2-Methyl-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, tiglylglycine is elevated in the urine at a concentration of 21 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 16148061) compared to normal children at a concentration of <5 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 16148061).",HMDB0000959,C\C=C(/C)C(=O)NCC(O)=O,C7H11NO3,"1S/C7H11NO3/c1-3-5(2)7(11)8-4-6(9)10/h3H,4H2,1-2H3,(H,8,11)(H,9,10)/b5-3+",WRUSVQOKJIDBLP-HWKANZROSA-N,2-[(2E)-2-methylbut-2-enamido]acetic acid,0.2098495370000003,15.789016254103654,157.1671,157.073893223,7.52e+00 g/l,0.33,-1.32,3,2,3,66.39999999999999,40.1255,15.97497515941016,[(2E)-2-methylbut-2-enamido]acetic acid,0,-1,-0.48813886941777895,4.09123447046491,1,0,1,0,0,0,MDB00000505,"5291,5346,5448,5474"
306,Acetaldehyde,"Acetaldehyde, also known as ethanal, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as short-chain aldehydes. These are an aldehyde with a chain length containing between 2 and 5 carbon atoms. Acetaldehyde exists a colorless, flammable liquid. Industrially, it is used in the manufacture of acetic acid, perfumes, and flavors. Acetaldehyde is an aldehydic, ethereal, and fruity tasting compound. Acetaldehyde is found in a few different foods, such as coffee, bread, sweet oranges, pineapples, and mandarin oranges (clementine, tangerine). In humans, acetaldehyde is produced as an intermediate in the metabolism of alcohol. In particular, acetaldehyde can be biosynthesized from ethanol; which is mediated by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase 1B. In addition, acetaldehyde can be converted into acetic acid; which is mediated by the mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase. Small amounts of acetaldehyde are also produced naturally through gut microbial fermentation.  Within the human body acetaldehyde has a general narcotic action and also causes irritation of mucous membranes. Large doses may cause death from respiratory paralysis. Acetaldehyde is linked to most of the negative clinical effects of alcohol. It has been shown to increase the risk of developing cirrhosis of the liver, multiple forms of cancer, and alcoholism. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has listed acetaldehyde as a Group 1 carcinogen.

307,DHEA sulfate,"DHEAS or Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate is the sulfated form of DHEA. This sulfation is reversibly catalyzed by sulfotransferase (SULT2A1) primarily in the adrenals, the liver, and small intestine. In the blood, most DHEA is found as DHEAS with levels that are about 300 times higher than those of free DHEA. Orally-ingested DHEA is converted to its sulfate when passing through intestines and liver. Whereas DHEA levels naturally reach their peak in the early morning hours, DHEAS levels show no diurnal variation. From a practical point of view, measurement of DHEAS is preferable to DHEA, as levels are more stable. DHEA (from which DHEAS comes from) is a natural steroid prohormone produced from cholesterol by the adrenal glands, the gonads, adipose tissue, brain and in the skin (by an autocrine mechanism). DHEA is the precursor of androstenedione, which can undergo further conversion to produce the androgen testosterone and the estrogens estrone and estradiol. DHEA is also a potent sigma-1 agonist. DHEAS can serve as a precursor for testosterone; androstenedione; estradiol; and estrone.↵",HMDB0001032,[H][C@@]12CCC(=O)[C@@]1(C)CC[C@@]1([H])[C@@]2([H])CC=C2C[C@H](CC[C@]12C)OS(O)(=O)=O,C19H28O5S,"1S/C19H28O5S/c1-18-9-7-13(24-25(21,22)23)11-12(18)3-4-14-15-5-6-17(20)19(15,2)10-8-16(14)18/h3,13-16H,4-11H2,1-2H3,(H,21,22,23)/t13-,14-,15-,16-,18-,19-/m0/s1",CZWCKYRVOZZJNM-USOAJAOKSA-N,"[(1S,2R,5S,10R,11S,15S)-2,15-dimethyl-14-oxotetracyclo[8.7.0.0^{2,7}.0^{11,15}]heptadec-7-en-5-yl]oxidanesulfonic acid",3.416690823333334,19.957705855662745,368.488,368.165744696,8.06e-03 g/l,0.49,-4.66,4,1,2,80.67,94.6507,39.8474725985752,"[(1S,2R,5S,10R,11S,15S)-2,15-dimethyl-14-oxotetracyclo[8.7.0.0^{2,7}.0^{11,15}]heptadec-7-en-5-yl]oxidanesulfonic acid",0,-1,-7.4756492107864165,-1.3632754765266997,1,4,1,1,0,0,MDB00000514,"5185,5231,5314,5328,5355,5356,5403,5405,5465"
308,Angiotensin II,"Angiotensin II is a peptide hormone with the sequence Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe. It is a hormone that causes vasoconstriction and an increase in blood pressure. It is part of the renin–angiotensin system, which regulates blood pressure. Angiotensin II results in increased inotropy, chronotropy, catecholamine (norepinephrine) release, catecholamine sensitivity, aldosterone levels, vasopressin levels, and cardiac remodeling and vasoconstriction through AT1 receptors on peripheral vessels. Angiotensin II may act on the central nervous system to regulate renal sympathetic nerve activity, renal function, and, therefore, blood pressure. Angiotensin II is produced locally within the kidney and mediates tissue injury through a series of nonhemodynamic effects. Angiotensin II is not only involved in the regulation of blood pressure, water and sodium homeostasis, and control of other neurohumoral systems, but also leads to excessive production of reactive oxygen species and to hypertrophy, proliferation, migration, and apoptosis of vascular cells. Angiotensin II is one of the main factors involved in hypertension-induced tissue damage. This peptide regulates the inflammatory process. Angiotensin II activates circulating cells, and participates in their adhesion to the activated endothelium and subsequent transmigration through the synthesis of adhesion molecules, chemokines and cytokines. Among the intracellular signals involved in angiotensin II-induced inflammation, the production of reactive oxygen species and the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB are the best known. Classical, well-defined actions of Angiotensin II in the brain include the regulation of hormone formation and release, the control of the central and peripheral sympathoadrenal systems, and the regulation of water and sodium intake. As a consequence of changes in the hormone, sympathetic and electrolyte systems, feedback mechanisms in turn modulate the activity of the brain Angiotensin II systems. There are two Angiotensin II systems in the brain. The discovery of brain Angiotensin II receptors located in neurons inside the blood brain barrier confirmed the existence of an endogenous brain Angiotensin II system, responding to Angiotensin II generated in and/or transported into the brain. In addition, Angiotensin II receptors in circumventricular organs and in cerebrovascular endothelial cells respond to circulating Angiotensin II of peripheral origin. Thus, the brain responds to both circulating and tissue Angiotensin II, and the two systems are integrated.

309,Enkephalin L,"Enkephalin L is an opioid peptide. Opioid peptides are a group of neuropeptides which include enkephalins, endorphins and dynorphins. In addition to their central and peripheral antinociceptive function, opioids can modulate immune activity and cell proliferation. Enkephalins typically have a turnover rate measured in seconds to minutes, both in vivo and in vitro, and this stability is related to the age of the cell system under study. It is noteworthy that the residues most essential to enkephalin function are also either neurotransmitters themselves (glycine) or immediate precursors of L-Dopa, dopamine and norepinephrine (tyrosine and phenylalanine). The variable fifth amino acid leucine (leu5) or methionine (met5) has not yet been assigned any neurotransmitter candidacy. Again, this suggests that enkephalin is polyfunctional in that, in its intact state it elicits binding to the same sites in the brain as morphine and other opiates, and its degradation products have a potential for follow-up accessory functions by reacting as signaling entities themselves, or as the immediate precursors to inhibitory or metabotropic neurotransmitters. Enkephalins are present in macrophages infiltrating the dermal papillae in involved psoriatic skin and that the amount of enkephalin is significantly increased in involved psoriatic skin. Major enkephalin pathways in the brain involve the extrapyramidal system, including motor pathways controlled by the basal ganglia, the limbic system that governs emotional and behavioral control, and the hypothalamic-neuroendocrine axis. The apparent overlap of localization within the central nervous system of dopaminergic, glycinergic, and enkephalinergic pathways is speculated to be of neurophysiological significance, especially in light of the relatively short half-life of the enkephalins and the immediate precursor-product relationship between tyrosine and dopamine, and glycinergic signaling. Enkephalins are released into the bloodstream of mammals by the adrenal medulla. Once they are in the blood, these peptides undergo a fairly rapid hydrolysis by several plasma-contained enzymes. However, a fraction of the enkephalins present in the plasma are bound to the serum albumin, and the bound peptides are almost completely intact even after a long incubation in the presence of serum enzymes.

310,Cotinine,"Cotinine is an alkaloid found in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum). Cotinine belongs to the class of organic compounds known as pyrrolidinylpyridines. Pyrrolidinylpyridines are compounds containing a pyrrolidinylpyridine ring system, which consists of a pyrrolidine ring linked to a pyridine ring. It is also the predominant human metabolite of nicotine (when nicotine is inhaled or absorbed). In humans, about 70 to 80% of nicotine that is inhaled or absorbed is converted to cotinine. This transformation involves two steps. The first is mediated by a cytochrome P450 system (mainly CYP2A6 and CYP2B6) to produce nicotine iminium ion. The second step is catalyzed by aldehyde oxidase (AOX). A number of cotinine metabolites have also been structurally characterized. Indeed, it appears that most of the reported urinary metabolites of nicotine are derived from cotinine. Cotinine is widely used as a biomarker for exposure to tobacco smoke. Cotinine has an in vivo half-life of approximately 20 hours, and is typically detectable for several days (up to one week) after the use of tobacco. Specifically, in adults (>18 years old) that smoke, cotinine is elevated in the blood at a concentration of 2.15 (0.11-25.00) μM (PMID: 19222926) compared to normal non-smoker adults at a concentration of 1.4 +/- 0.9 μM (PMID: 17400560). In active tobacco users, cotinine is also elevated in the blood at a concentration of 2.5 (1.13-4.54) μM (PMID: 12194923) compared to normal non tobacco using adults at a concentration of 1.4 +/- 0.9 μM (PMID: 17400560). Cotinine is also shown to be elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid of children (1-13 years old) who have beenn exposed to their smoking mothers passively at a concentration of 0.0670 +/- 0.0664 μM (PMID: 19036546) compared to normal children at a concentration of 0.112 +/- 0.0823 μM (PMID: 19036546). Similar to nicotine, cotinine binds to, activates, and desensitizes neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, though at much lower potency in comparison. It has demonstrated nootropic and antipsychotic-like effects in animal models. Cotinine treatment has also been shown to reduce depression, anxiety, and fear-related behavior as well as memory impairment in animal models of depression, PTSD, and Alzheimer's disease.",HMDB0001046,CN1C(CCC1=O)C1=CN=CC=C1,C10H12N2O,"1S/C10H12N2O/c1-12-9(4-5-10(12)13)8-3-2-6-11-7-8/h2-3,6-7,9H,4-5H2,1H3",UIKROCXWUNQSPJ-UHFFFAOYSA-N,1-methyl-5-(pyridin-3-yl)pyrrolidin-2-one,0.2106345276666668,,176.2151,176.094963016,1.17e+02 g/l,0.39,-0.18,2,0,1,33.2,49.2805,18.57458933125395,(-)-cotinine,0,0,4.789340020074378,,1,2,1,1,1,0,MDB00000519,5550
311,Ubiquinol 8,"Ubiquinol 8 is a ubiquinol in which the polyprenyl substituent is octaprenyl. Ubiquinol-8 is the reduced form of ubiquinone-8. Ubiquinone (also known as coenzyme Q) is an isoprenoid quinone that functions as an electron carrier in membranes. In eukaryotes, ubiquinone is found mostly within the inner mitochondrial membrane where it functions in respiratory electron transport, transferring two electrons from either complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) or complex II (succinate-ubiquinone reductase) to complex III (bc1 complex). The quinone nucleus of ubiquinone is derived directly from 4-hydroxybenzoate, while the isoprenoid subunits of the polyisoprenoid tail are synthesized via the methylerythritol phosphate pathway, which feeds isoprene units into the polyprenyl biosynthesis pathways. The number of isoprenoid subunits in the ubiquinone side chain varies in different species. For example, Saccharomyces cerevisiae has 6 such subunits, Escherichia coli K-12 has 8, rat and mouse have 9, and Homo sapiens has 10. Ubiquinol-8 is effective as an anti-oxidant. By donating one of its hydrogen atoms to become the free-radical semiquinone (.Q-), it can neutralize a lipid peroxyl radical. The free-radical semiquinone is then restored to a non-free-radical state by the respiratory chain Q cycle. Ubiquinol or the free-radical semiquinone can also regenerate the Vitamin E tocopheroxyl radical by electron donation (http://www.benbest.com/nutrceut/CoEnzymeQ.html).",HMDB0001060,COC1=C(OC)C(O)C(C\C=C(/C)CC\C=C(/C)CC\C=C(/C)CC\C=C(/C)CC\C=C(/C)CC\C=C(/C)CC\C=C(/C)CCC=C(C)C)=C(C)C1O,C49H78O4,"1S/C49H78O4/c1-36(2)20-13-21-37(3)22-14-23-38(4)24-15-25-39(5)26-16-27-40(6)28-17-29-41(7)30-18-31-42(8)32-19-33-43(9)34-35-45-44(10)46(50)48(52-11)49(53-12)47(45)51/h20,22,24,26,28,30,32,34,46-47,50-51H,13-19,21,23,25,27,29,31,33,35H2,1-12H3/b37-22+,38-24+,39-26+,40-28+,41-30+,42-32+,43-34+",FLVUMORHBJZINO-SGHXUWJISA-N,"2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-[(2E,6E,10E,14E,18E,22E,26E)-3,7,11,15,19,23,27,31-octamethyldotriaconta-2,6,10,14,18,22,26,30-octaen-1-yl]benzene-1,4-diol",14.910760955,12.153761006645082,731.1412,730.590010984,2.73e-04 g/l,9.35,-6.43,4,2,25,58.92,238.84840000000014,94.27937653403029,ubiquinol-8,0,0,-4.664919089384427,10.266548299637904,0,1,0,0,0,0,MDB00000524,

313,Leukotriene B4,"Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is a leukotriene involved in inflammation. It is produced from leukocytes in response to inflammatory mediators and is able to induce the adhesion and activation of leukocytes on the endothelium, allowing them to bind to and cross it into the tissue. Leukotrienes are metabolites of arachidonic acid derived from the action of 5-LO (5-lipoxygenase). The immediate product of 5-LO is LTA4 (leukotriene A4), which is enzymatically converted into either LTB4 (leukotriene B4) by LTA4 hydrolase or LTC4 (leukotriene C4) by LTC4 synthase. The regulation of leukotriene production occurs at various levels, including expression of 5-LO, translocation of 5-LO to the perinuclear region and phosphorylation to either enhance or inhibit the activity of 5-LO. Biologically active LTB4 is metabolized by w-oxidation carried out by specific cytochrome P450s (CYP4F) followed by b-oxidation from the w-carboxy position and after CoA ester formation. Other specific pathways of leukotriene metabolism include the 12-hydroxydehydrogenase/ 15-oxo-prostaglandin-13-reductase that form a series of conjugated diene metabolites that have been observed to be excreted into human urine. Metabolism of LTC4 occurs by sequential peptide cleavage reactions involving a gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase that forms LTD4 (leukotriene D4) and a membrane-bound dipeptidase that converts LTD4 into LTE4 (leukotriene E4) before omega-oxidation. These metabolic transformations of the primary leukotrienes are critical for termination of their biological activity, and defects in expression of participating enzymes may be involved in specific genetic disease. The term leukotriene was coined to indicate the presence of three conjugated double bonds within the 20-carbon structure of arachidonic acid as well as the fact that these compounds were derived from leucocytes such as PMNNs or transformed mast cells. Interestingly, most of the cells known to express 5-LO are of myeloid origin, which includes neutrophils, eosinophils, mast cells, macrophages, basophils and monocytes. Leukotriene biosynthesis begins with the specific oxidation of arachidonic acid by a free radical mechanism as a consequence of interaction with 5-LO. The first enzymatic step involves the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from C-7 of arachidonate followed by the addition of molecular oxygen to form 5-HpETE (5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid). A second enzymatic step is also catalysed by 5-LO and involves removal of a hydrogen atom from C-10, resulting in formation of the conjugated triene epoxide LTA4. LTA4 must then be released by 5-LO and encounter either LTA4-H (LTA4 hydrolase) or LTC4-S [LTC4 (leukotriene C4) synthase]. LTA4-H can stereospecifically add water to C-12 while retaining a specific double-bond geometry, leading to LTB4 [leukotriene B4, 5(S),12(R)-dihydroxy-6,8,10,14-(Z,E,E,Z)-eicosatetraenoic acid]. If LTA4 encounters LTC4-S, then the reactive epoxide is opened at C-6 by the thiol anion of glutathione to form the product LTC4 [5(S)-hydroxy-6(R)-S-glutathyionyl-7,9,11,14- (E,E,Z,Z)-eicosatetraenoic acid], essentially a glutathionyl adduct of oxidized arachidonic acid. Both of these terminal leukotrienes are biologically active in that specific GPCRs recognize these chemical structures and receptor recognition initiates complex intracellular signalling cascades. In order for these molecules to serve as lipid mediators, however, they must be released from the biosynthetic cell into the extracellular milieu so that they can encounter the corresponding GPCRs. Surprising features of this cascade include the recognition of the assembly of critical enzymes at the perinuclear region of the cell and even localization of 5-LO within the nucleus of some cells. Under some situations, the budding phagosome has been found to assemble these proteins. Non-enzymatic proteins such as FLAP are now known as critical partners of this protein-machine assembly. An unexpected pathway of leukotriene biosynthesis involves the transfer of the chemically reactive intermediate, LTA4, from the biosynthetic cell followed by conversion into LTB4 or LTC4 by other cells that do not express 5-LO.

315,Prostaglandin F2a,"Prostaglandin F2a (PGF2) is a naturally occurring prostaglandin. It is one of the earliest discovered and most common prostaglandins. It is actively biosynthesized in various organs of mammals and exhibits a variety of biological activities, including contraction of pulmonary arteries. It is used in medicine to induce labor and as an abortifacient. PGF2a binds to the Prostaglandin F2 receptor (PTGFR) which is a member of the G-protein coupled receptor family. PGF2-alpha mediates luteolysis. Luteolysis is the structural and functional degradation of the corpus luteum (CL) that occurs at the end of the luteal phase of both the estrous and menstrual cycles in the absence of pregnancy. PGF2 may also be involved in modulating intraocular pressure and smooth muscle contraction in the uterus and gastrointestinal tract sphincters. PGF2 is mainly synthesized directly from PGH2 by PGH2 9,11-endoperoxide reductase. A small amount of PGF2 is also produced from PGE2 by PGE2 9-ketoreductase. A PGF2 epimer has been reported to exhibit various biological activities, and its levels are increased in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, plasma, and urine in patients with mastocytosis and bronchial asthma.

322,Aluminum,"Aluminum is a soft, lightweight metal with an appearance ranging from silvery to dull gray, depending on the surface roughness. Aluminium makes up about 8% of the Earth's crust, where it is the third most abundant element (after oxygen and silicon) and also the most abundant metal. Physiologically, aluminum exists as an ion in the body. Despite its widespread occurrence in the Earth's crust, aluminium has no known function in biology. Aluminum is regularly taken up with the daily diet. Most aluminium consumed will leave the body in feces; most of the small part of it that enters the bloodstream, will be excreted via urine. Aluminum is also used in antiperspirants, as an adjuvant for vaccination, and in desensitization procedures. The acute toxicity of aluminum is low with aluminium sulfate having an LD50 of 6207 mg/kg. No acute effects due to dietary exposure to aluminum have been observed in the general population (PMID: 29034866 ). Aluminum (Al3+) exhibits a high affinity to proteins, which it is able to cross-link. In contrast to other ubiquitously occurring metals such as iron, manganese, and zinc, aluminum is not known to perform a physiological function in the human organism. Clinically relevant, neurotoxic effects have been described in dialysis patients. Aluminum salts, which were formerly added to the dialysate as a phosphate binder, were identified as the causal agents. In addition to inducing oxidative stress and binding to negatively charged membrane structures in neurons, aluminum is able to modify hippocampal calcium signal pathways that are crucial to neuronal plasticity and, hence, to memory. Changes in neuropsychological tests (e.g., in relation to concentration, learning, and memory) were observed following occupational exposure of workers in whom concentrations of approximately 100 µg aluminum/g creatinine and approximately 13 µg/L plasma were measured (PMID: 29034866). Data indicates that aluminum contaminates much of the raw material used to manufacture solutions used for intravenous nutritional support of hospitalized and ambulatory patients, and that pharmaceutical manufacturers have only recently obtained the technology necessary to detect aluminum contamination of their products. As a result, aluminum bypassed normal barriers and entered the blood, accumulating in bone, the liver, and the central nervous system with toxic consequences. Now that the FDA has finally issued a rule governing aluminum contamination in these solutions, manufacturers will need to develop methods to minimize such contamination. Scientists should also realize that when the data they obtain indicate a serious problem in the manufacturing sector, they should be sure that the problem is properly addressed. Physiologically, this metal/element exists as an ion in the body (PMID: 16198633 ). Aluminum acetate is an astringent. An astringent is a chemical that tends to shrink or constrict body tissues, usually locally after topical medicinal application. The shrinkage or constriction is through the osmotic flow of water (or other fluids) away from the area where the astringent was applied. Astringent medicines cause shrinkage of mucous membranes or exposed tissues and are often used internally to check discharge of blood serum or mucous secretions. This can happen with a sore throat, hemorrhages, diarrhea, or with peptic ulcers. Externally applied astringents, which cause mild coagulation of skin proteins, dry, harden, and protect the skin. Acne sufferers are often advised to use astringents if they have oily skin. Astringents also help heal stretch marks and other scars. Mild astringent solutions are used in the relief of such minor skin irritations as those resulting from superficial cuts, allergies, insect bites, or fungal infections such as athlete's foot. Aluminium is associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), Multiple sclerosis (MS) and Parkinson's disease (PD). In the elederly (>65 years old) with AD, aluminum is elevated in the blood at a concentration of 0.0823 +/- 0.0460 μM (PMID: 16244393) compared to normal elderly at a concentration of 0.1 +/- 0.056 μM (PMID: 16244393). Similarly, in adults (>18 years old) with MS, aluminum is elevated in the blood at a concentration of 0.89 +/- 0.79 μM (PMID: 16244395) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 0.037-0.410 μM (Molecular You). This trend is also seen in adults (>18 years old) with PD where aluminum in the blood is elevated at a concentration of 0.11 +/- 0.00061 μM (PMID: 16244392) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 0.037-0.410 μM (Molecular You).",HMDB0001247,[Al+3],Al,1S/Al/q+3,REDXJYDRNCIFBQ-UHFFFAOYSA-N,alumane,1.4499999999999997,,26.9815,26.981538441,,,,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,1.7784,alumane,0,0,,,1,0,1,0,1,0,MDB00000558,"5185,5225"

These are organic compounds containing a dialkylamine group, characterized by two alkyl groups bonded to the amino nitrogen. Spermine is also classified as a biogenic polyamine. The precursor for synthesis of spermine is the amino acid ornithine. Spermine can also be formed from spermidine. Spermine biosynthesis in animals starts with decarboxylation of ornithine by the enzyme Ornithine decarboxylase in the presence of Pyridoxal phosphate. This decarboxylation gives putrescine. Thereafter the enzyme spermidine synthase effects a further N-alkylation by decarboxy-S-Adenosyl methionine. The intermediate is spermidine. It is found in a wide variety of organisms and tissues and is an essential growth factor in some bacteria Polyamines such as spermine play important roles in cell physiology and have important effects on the structure of cellular macromolecules, gene expression, protein function, nucleic acid and protein synthesis, regulation of ion channels, and providing protection from oxidative damage (PMID: 24395705).",HMDB0001256,NCCCNCCCCNCCCN,C10H26N4,"1S/C10H26N4/c11-5-3-9-13-7-1-2-8-14-10-4-6-12/h13-14H,1-12H2",PFNFFQXMRSDOHW-UHFFFAOYSA-N,(3-aminopropyl)({4-[(3-aminopropyl)amino]butyl})amine,-1.4540076160000006,,202.3402,202.215746852,2.19e+00 g/l,-0.66,-1.97,4,4,11,76.1,62.558200000000014,26.694691643339382,spermine,0,4,10.799251803165692,,1,0,1,0,0,0,MDB00000560,"5244,5300"

It is formed from putrescine and is a precursor for spermine.  More specifically, spermidine synthase (SPDS) catalyzes its formation from putrescine. Spermidine is found in almost all tissues in association with nucleic acids. Polyamines such as spermine play important roles in cell physiology and have important effects on the structure of cellular macromolecules, gene expression, protein function, nucleic acid and protein synthesis, regulation of ion channels, and providing protection from oxidative damage (PMID: 24395705). Spermidine regulates a number of biological processes, such as Ca2+ influx by glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA receptor), which has been associated with nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and cGMP/PKG pathway activation and a decrease of Na+,K+-ATPase activity in cerebral cortex synaptosomes.",HMDB0001257,NCCCCNCCCN,C7H19N3,"1S/C7H19N3/c8-4-1-2-6-10-7-3-5-9/h10H,1-9H2",ATHGHQPFGPMSJY-UHFFFAOYSA-N,(4-aminobutyl)(3-aminopropyl)amine,-1.1495639400000002,,145.2459,145.157897623,3.27e+01 g/l,-0.62,-0.65,3,3,7,64.07,44.968399999999995,18.802478340004217,spermidine,0,3,10.676624477088431,,1,0,1,0,0,0,MDB00000561,"5183,5269,5300"
325,N1-Acetylspermidine,"N1-Acetylspermidine is an acetylated derivative of spermidine. It is a polyamine. In many organisms, polyamines originate from L-ornithine and methionine. Ornithine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.17), a key enzyme in polyamine metabolism, decarboxylates L-ornithine to yield putrescine which is then converted to higher polyamines spermidine and spermine by successive addition of aminopropyl groups derived from decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine. Aliphatic polyamines occur ubiquitously in organisms and have important functions in the stabilization of cell membranes, biosynthesis of informing molecules, cell growth and differentiation, as well as adaptation to osmotic, ionic, pH and thermal stress. These cationic substances are implicated in multiple functions, therefore it is not surprising that intracellular levels of polyamines are regulated by different mechanisms. The inhibition of polyamine metabolism has important pharmacological and therapeutic implications for the control of physiological processes, reproduction, cancer and parasitic diseases. Recent reports have suggested the idea that parasites with an high turnover of Ornithine Decarboxilase (ODC) are resistant to Difluoromethyl ornithine (DFMO, the irreversible inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase) because they always contain a fraction of newly synthesized and active enzyme, therefore not DFMO inhibited, sufficient to produce small amounts of putrescine rapidly converted into spermidine, which can support protozoan proliferation. DFMO has proved to be curative in trypanosomiasis, coccidiosis, and certain other protozoan infections.

326,Molybdenum,"Molybdenum is a transition metal with the atomic symbol Mo, atomic number 42, and atomic weight 95.94. The pure metal is silvery white in color, fairly soft, and has one of the highest melting points of all pure elements. Physiologically, molybdenum exists as an ion in the body. It is an essential trace element, being a component of the enzymes xanthine oxidase, aldehyde oxidase, and nitrate reductase. There is a trace requirement for molybdenum in plants, and soils can be barren due to molybdenum deficiencies. Plants and animals generally have molybdenum present in amounts of a few parts per million. In animals molybdenum is a cofactor of the enzyme xanthine oxidase which is involved in the pathways of purine degradation and formation of uric acid. In some animals, adding a small amount of dietary molybdenum enhances growth. Francis Crick suggested that since molybdenum is an essential trace element that plays an important role in many enzymatic reactions, despite being less abundant than the more common elements, such as chromium and nickel, that perhaps this fact is indicative of ""Panspermia."" Crick theorized that if it could be shown that the elements represented in terrestrial living organisms correlate closely with those that are abundant in some class of star - molybdenum stars, for example, that this would provide evidence of such Directed Panspermia. In small quantities, molybdenum is effective at hardening steel. Molybdenum is important in plant nutrition, and is found in certain enzymes, including xanthine oxidase. Molybdenum is used to this day in high-strength alloys and in high-temperature steels. Special molybdenum-containing alloys, such as the Hastelloys, are notably heat-resistant and corrosion-resistant. Molybdenum is used in oil pipelines, aircraft and missile parts, and in filaments. Molybdenum finds use as a catalyst in the petroleum industry, especially in catalysts for removing organic sulfurs from petroleum products. It is used to form the anode in some x-ray tubes, particularly in mammography applications. And is found in some electronic applications as the conductive metal layers in thin-film transistors (TFTs). Molybdenum disulfide is a good lubricant, especially at high temperatures. And Mo-99 is used in the nuclear isotope industry. Molybdenum pigments range from red-yellow to a bright red orange and are used in paints, inks, plastics, and rubber compounds. Molybdenum has been quantified as a marker in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients’ blood at a lower concentration of 0.022 (0.013-0.030) uM (2.11 ng/mL) compared to that of healthy individuals (2.94 ng/mL) (PMID: 16244395). The pathology of MS is still unknown but environmental, genetic and immunological factors are mentioned as effective agents. For example, molybdenum can cause copper deficiency in the body. This speaks to the implications that MS occurs because of environmental factors like soil pollution and the composition of Mo in the soil is correlated to the incidence of MS. Molybdenum has also been implicated for its role in oxidative damage in Alzheimer’s disease and has been found to be decreased in patient blood compared to that of healthy individuals (PMID: 16244393). A similar trend in decreased concentration of molybdenum has been seen in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PMID: 16244392).",HMDB0001302,[Mo++],Mo,1S/Mo/q+2,MMVYPOCJESWGTC-UHFFFAOYSA-N,molybdenum(2+) ion,0,,95.94,97.905407846,,,,0,0,0,0,0,1.7784,molybdenum(2+) ion,2,2,,,1,0,1,0,1,0,MDB00000573,5241

The soft tissue remainder is concentrated in the liver and kidney.  In biology, manganese(II) ions function as cofactors for a large variety of enzymes with many functions. Manganese enzymes are particularly essential in detoxification of superoxide free radicals in organisms that must deal with elemental oxygen. Manganese is a cofactor for several enzymes including arginase and alkaline phosphatase in the liver. Manganese also functions in the oxygen-evolving complex of photosynthetic plants.

329,Alpha-Linolenic acid,"Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) is a polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA). It is a member of the group of essential fatty acids called omega-3 fatty acids. Alpha-linolenic acid, in particular, is not synthesized by mammals and therefore is an essential dietary requirement for all mammals. Certain nuts (English walnuts) and vegetable oils (canola, soybean, flaxseed/linseed, olive) are particularly rich in alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). Omega-3 fatty acids get their name based on the location of one of their first double bond. In all omega-3 fatty acids, the first double bond is located between the third and fourth carbon atom counting from the methyl end of the fatty acid (n-3). Although humans and other mammals can synthesize saturated and some monounsaturated fatty acids from carbon groups in carbohydrates and proteins, they lack the enzymes necessary to insert a cis double bond at the n-6 or the n-3 position of a fatty acid. Omega-3 fatty acids like a-linolenic acid are important structural components of cell membranes. When incorporated into phospholipids, they affect cell membrane properties such as fluidity, flexibility, permeability and the activity of membrane bound enzymes. Omega-3 fatty acids can modulate the expression of a number of genes, including those involved with fatty acid metabolism and inflammation. Alpha linolenic acid and other omega 3 fatty acids may regulate gene expression by interacting with specific transcription factors, including peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs) and liver X receptors (LXRs).↵",HMDB0001388,CC\C=C/C\C=C/C\C=C/CCCCCCCC(O)=O,C18H30O2,"1S/C18H30O2/c1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-11-12-13-14-15-16-17-18(19)20/h3-4,6-7,9-10H,2,5,8,11-17H2,1H3,(H,19,20)/b4-3-,7-6-,10-9-",DTOSIQBPPRVQHS-PDBXOOCHSA-N,"(9Z,12Z,15Z)-octadeca-9,12,15-trienoic acid",6.059955137666666,,278.4296,278.224580204,2.66e-04 g/l,6.62,-6.02,2,1,13,37.3,89.6354,34.98036100681455,α linolenic acid,0,-1,,4.988167283903808,0,0,0,0,0,0,MDB00000595,"5254,5273,5293"
330,Melatonin,"Melatonin is a biogenic amine that is found in animals, plants and microbes. In animals, biosynthesis of melatonin occurs through hydroxylation, decarboxylation, acetylation and a methylation step starting with L-tryptophan. Aaron B.Lerner of Yale University is credited for naming the hormone and for defining its chemical structure in 1958. In mammals, melatonin is produced by the pineal gland. The pineal gland is small endocrine gland, about the size of a rice grain and shaped like a pine cone (hence the name), that is located in the center of the brain (rostro-dorsal to the superior colliculus) but outside the blood-brain barrier. In vertebrates, melatonin secretion is regulated by activation of the beta-1 adrenergic receptor by norepinephrine. Blue light, principally around 460–480 nm, suppresses melatonin biosynthesis. The secretion of melatonin increases in darkness and decreases during exposure to light, thereby regulating the circadian rhythms of several biological functions, including the sleep-wake cycle. In particular, melatonin regulates the sleep-wake cycle by chemically causing drowsiness and - lowering the body temperature. Melatonin is also implicated in the regulation of mood, learning and memory, immune activity, dreaming, fertility and reproduction. Melatonin is also an effective antioxidant. Most of the actions of melatonin are mediated through the binding and activation of melatonin receptors. Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) may have lower than normal levels of melatonin. A 2008 study found that unaffected parents of individuals with ASD also have lower melatonin levels, and that the deficits were associated with low activity of the ASMT gene, which encodes the last enzyme of melatonin synthesis. Reduced melatonin production has also been proposed as a likely factor in the significantly higher cancer rates in night workers.",HMDB0001389,COC1=CC2=C(NC=C2CCNC(C)=O)C=C1,C13H16N2O2,"1S/C13H16N2O2/c1-9(16)14-6-5-10-8-15-13-4-3-11(17-2)7-12(10)13/h3-4,7-8,15H,5-6H2,1-2H3,(H,14,16)",DRLFMBDRBRZALE-UHFFFAOYSA-N,N-[2-(5-methoxy-1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl]acetamide,1.1476127873333333,16.59127620174317,232.2783,232.121177766,1.43e-01 g/l,1.42,-3.21,2,2,4,54.120000000000005,66.2799,25.649878848425523,melatonin,0,0,-1.568617764839225,15.795496949109147,1,2,1,1,0,0,MDB00000596,5244
331,5-Methyltetrahydrofolic acid,"5-Methyltetrahydrofolic acid (5-MTHF) is the most biologically active form of the B-vitamin folic acid, also known generically as folate. 5-MTHF functions, in concert with vitamin B12, as a methyl-group donor involved in the conversion of the amino acid homocysteine to methionine. Methyl (CH3) group donation is vital to many bodily processes, including serotonin, melatonin, and DNA synthesis. Therapeutically, 5-MTHF is instrumental in reducing homocysteine levels, preventing neural tube defects, and improving vascular endothelial function. Research on folate supplementation suggests it plays a key role in preventing cervical dysplasia and protecting against neoplasia in ulcerative colitis. Folic acid also shows promise as part of a nutritional protocol to treat vitiligo, and may reduce inflammation of the gingiva. Furthermore, certain neurological, cognitive, and psychiatric presentations may be secondary to folate deficiency. Such presentations include depression, peripheral neuropathy, myelopathy, restless legs syndrome, insomnia, dementia, forgetfulness, irritability, endogenous depression, organic psychosis, and schizophrenia-like syndromes. After ingestion, the process of conversion of folic acid to the metabolically active coenzyme forms is relatively complex. Synthesis of the active forms of folic acid requires several enzymes, adequate liver and intestinal function, and adequate supplies of riboflavin (B2), niacin (B3), pyridoxine (B6), zinc, vitamin C, and serine. After formation of the coenzyme forms of the vitamin in the liver, these metabolically active compounds are secreted into the small intestine with bile (the folate enterohepatic cycle), where they are reabsorbed and distributed to tissues throughout the body. Human pharmacokinetic studies indicate folic acid has high bioavailability, with large oral doses of folic acid substantially raising plasma levels in healthy subjects in a time and dose dependent manner. Red blood cells (RBCs) appear to be the storage depot for folic acid, as RBC levels remain elevated for periods in excess of 40 days following discontinuation of supplementation. Folic acid is poorly transported to the brain and rapidly cleared from the central nervous system. The primary methods of elimination of absorbed folic acid are fecal (through bile) and urinary. Despite the biochemical complexity of this process, evidence suggests oral supplementation with folic acid increases the body's pool of 5-MTHF in healthy individuals. However, enzyme defects, mal-absorption, digestive system pathology, and liver disease can result in impaired ability to activate folic acid. In fact, some individuals have a severe congenital deficiency of the enzyme Methyl tetrahydrofolate reductase (5-MTHFR), which is needed to convert folic acid to 5-MTHF.

332,Putrescine,"Putrescine is a polyamine. Putrescine is related to cadaverine (another polyamine). Both are produced by the breakdown of amino acids in living and dead organisms and both are toxic in large doses. Putrescine and cadaverine are largely responsible for the foul odor of putrefying flesh, but also contribute to the odor of such processes as bad breath and bacterial vaginosis. Putrescine is also found in semen. Putrescine attacks S-adenosyl methionine and converts it to spermidine. Spermidine in turn attacks another S-adenosyl methionine and converts it to spermine. Putrescine is synthesized in small quantities by healthy living cells by the action of ornithine decarboxylase. The polyamines, of which putrescine is one of the simplest, appear to be growth factors necessary for cell division. Putrescine apparently has specific role in skin physiology and neuroprotection. (PMID: 15009201, 16364196). Pharmacological interventions have demonstrated convincingly that a steady supply of polyamines is a prerequisite for cell proliferation to occur. Genetic engineering of polyamine metabolism in transgenic rodents has shown that polyamines play a role in spermatogenesis, skin physiology, promotion of tumorigenesis and organ hypertrophy as well as neuronal protection. Transgenic activation of polyamine catabolism not only profoundly disturbs polyamine homeostasis in most tissues, but also creates a complex phenotype affecting skin, female fertility, fat depots, pancreatic integrity and regenerative growth. Transgenic expression of ornithine decarboxylase antizyme has suggested that this unique protein may act as a general tumor suppressor. Homozygous deficiency of the key biosynthetic enzymes of the polyamines, ornithine and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase is not compatible with murine embryogenesis.↵",HMDB0001414,NCCCCN,C4H12N2,1S/C4H12N2/c5-3-1-2-4-6/h1-6H2,KIDHWZJUCRJVML-UHFFFAOYSA-N,"butane-1,4-diamine",-0.845120264,,88.1515,88.100048394,2.36e+02 g/l,-0.98,0.43,2,2,3,52.04,27.3786,11.070241676529026,putrescine,0,2,10.505115467408618,,1,0,1,0,0,0,MDB00000606,"5183,5190,5244,5300,5313"
333,24-Hydroxycholesterol,"24-Hydroxycholesterol (24OHC) is an oxysterol that is almost exclusively formed in the brain. The enzymatic conversion of CNS cholesterol to 24OHC, which readily crosses the blood-brain barrier, is the major pathway for brain cholesterol elimination and brain cholesterol homeostasis maintenance. The enzyme mediating this conversion has been characterized at the molecular level as cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.13.98, CYP46) and is mainly located in neurons. Like other oxysterols, 24OHC is efficiently converted into normal bile acids or excreted in bile in its sulfated and glucuronidated form. Levels of 24OHC in the circulation decrease with age in infants and children. In adults, however, the levels appear to be stable. There is accumulating evidence pointing toward a potentially important link between cholesterol, beta-amyloid, and Alzheimer's disease. Patients with active demyelinating diseases had increased levels of 24OHC in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Patients with Alzheimer's disease have slightly increased levels of 24OHC in CSF. Patients with multiple sclerosis have a tendency to have higher levels of 24OHC during active periods.

334,Estrone sulfate,Estrone sulfate is a sulfated estrone derivative. Estrone sulfate acts as a long-lived estrogen reservoir that can be converted as needed to the more active estradiol (from estrone via 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase). Estrone Sulfate (E1S) is the most abundant circulating estrogen in non-pregnant women as well as normal men. Estrone is primarily synthesized from estrone sulfate. Estrone is an estrogenic hormone secreted by the ovaries and adipose tissues. Estrone is one of the three estrogens found in humans. The other two are estriol and estradiol. Estrone is the least prevalent of the three. Estradiol plays a critical role on reproductive and sexual functioning in women and it also affects other organs including the bones. Estriol is an estrogen that is prevalent primarily during pregnancy.↵,HMDB0001425,C[C@]12CC[C@H]3[C@@H](CCC4=C3C=CC(OS(O)(=O)=O)=C4)[C@@H]1CCC2=O,C18H22O5S,"1S/C18H22O5S/c1-18-9-8-14-13-5-3-12(23-24(20,21)22)10-11(13)2-4-15(14)16(18)6-7-17(18)19/h3,5,10,14-16H,2,4,6-9H2,1H3,(H,20,21,22)/t14-,15-,16+,18+/m1/s1",JKKFKPJIXZFSSB-CBZIJGRNSA-N,"[(1S,10R,11S,15S)-15-methyl-14-oxotetracyclo[8.7.0.0²,⁷.0¹¹,¹⁵]heptadeca-2(7),3,5-trien-5-yl]oxidanesulfonic acid",3.8337156876666674,19.95753456331333,350.429,350.118794504,5.90e-03 g/l,0.29,-4.77,4,1,2,80.67,89.0742,36.64215671380046,Ogen,0,-1,-7.475652910099836,-1.7480068663945287,1,4,1,1,0,0,MDB00000609,"5237,5314"
335,Phosphate,"Phosphate is a salt of phosphoric acid and is an essential component of life. Organic phosphates are important in biochemistry, biogeochemistry, and ecology. In biological systems, phosphorus is found as a free phosphate ion in solution and is called inorganic phosphate, to distinguish it from phosphates bound in various phosphate esters. Inorganic phosphate is generally denoted Pi and at physiological (neutral) pH primarily consists of a mixture of HPO2-4 and H2PO-4 ions. Phosphates are most commonly found in the form of adenosine phosphates (AMP, ADP, and ATP) and in DNA and RNA, and can be released by the hydrolysis of ATP or ADP. Similar reactions exist for the other nucleoside diphosphates and triphosphates. Phosphoanhydride bonds in ADP and ATP, or other nucleoside diphosphates and triphosphates, contain high amounts of energy which give them their vital role in all living organisms. Phosphate must be actively transported into cells against its electrochemical gradient. In vertebrates, two unrelated families of Na+-dependent Pi transporters carry out this task. Remarkably, the two families transport different Pi species: whereas type II Na+/Pi cotransporters (SCL34) prefer divalent HPO4(2), type III Na+/Pi cotransporters (SLC20) transport monovalent H2PO4. The SCL34 family comprises both electrogenic and electroneutral members that are expressed in various epithelia and other polarized cells. Through regulated activity in apical membranes of the gut and kidney, they maintain body Pi homeostasis, and in salivary and mammary glands, liver, and testes they play a role in modulating the Pi content of luminal fluids. Phosphate levels in the blood play an important role in hormone signalling and in bone homeostasis. In classical endocrine regulation, low serum phosphate induces the renal production of the secosteroid hormone 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3). This active metabolite of vitamin D acts to restore circulating mineral (i.e. phosphate and calcium) levels by increasing absorption in the intestine, reabsorption in the kidney, and mobilization of calcium and phosphate from bone. Thus, chronic renal failure is associated with hyperparathyroidism, which in turn contributes to osteomalacia (softening of the bones). Another complication of chronic renal failure is hyperphosphatemia (low levels of phosphate in the blood). Hyperphosphatemia (excess levels of phosphate in the blood) is a prevalent condition in kidney dialysis patients and is associated with increased risk of mortality. Hypophosphatemia (hungry bone syndrome) has been associated with postoperative electrolyte aberrations and after parathyroidectomy (PMID: 17581921 , 11169009 , 11039261 , 9159312 , 17625581 ). Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) has recently been recognized as a key mediator of phosphate homeostasis and its most notable effect is the promotion of phosphate excretion. FGF-23 was discovered to be involved in diseases such as autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets, X-linked hypophosphatemia, and tumour-induced osteomalacia in which phosphate wasting was coupled to inappropriately low levels of 1,25(OH)2D3. FGF-23 is regulated by dietary phosphate in humans. In particular, it was found that phosphate restriction decreased FGF-23, and phosphate loading increased FGF-23. In agriculture, phosphate refers to one of the three primary plant nutrients, and it is a component of fertilizers. In ecological terms, because of its important role in biological systems, phosphate is a highly sought after resource. Consequently, it is often a limiting reagent in environments, and its availability may govern the rate of growth of organisms. Addition of high levels of phosphate to environments and to micro-environments in which it is typically rare can have significant ecological consequences. In the context of pollution, phosphates are a principal component of total dissolved solids, a major indicator of water quality. Dihydrogen phosphate is an inorganic salt used in numerous analytical methods, and in buffer solutions (PMID: 15369738 ). It is one of several forms of the phosphate ion that can exist physiologically. It readily forms salts with sodium or potassium cations.",HMDB0001429,[O-]P([O-])([O-])=O,O4P,"1S/H3O4P/c1-5(2,3)4/h(H3,1,2,3,4)/p-3",NBIIXXVUZAFLBC-UHFFFAOYSA-K,phosphoric acid,-1.0201038226666665,6.951626889535468,94.9714,94.95342,,,,4,3,0,77.76,14.651900000000001,5.80725928154798,phosphoric acid,0,-2,,1.7961261340181318,1,0,1,0,0,0,MDB00000611,"5230,5234,5302,5430,5514,5516"

Pyridoxamine is the 4-aminomethyl form of vitamin B6. Pyridoxamine is one of the compounds that can be formally called vitamin B6, along with Pyridoxal and Pyridoxine. Pyridoxamine differs from Pyridoxine by the substituent at the 4-position. pyridoxamine participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, Pyridoxamine can be converted into Pyridoxal; which is mediated by the enzyme Pyridoxine-5'-phosphate oxidase. In addition, Pyridoxamine can be converted into Pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate; which is catalyzed by the enzyme Pyridoxal kinase.

338,25-Hydroxyvitamin D2,"25-hydroxyvitamin D2, also known as ergocalciferol or calciferol, is the biologically active metabolite of vitamin D2. Ergocalciferol is a type of vitamin D found in food and used as a dietary supplement. Ergocalciferol is a secosteroid formed by a photochemical bond breaking of a steroid, specifically, by the action of ultraviolet light on ergosterol, a form of provitamin D2. As a supplement ergocalciferol is used to prevent and treat vitamin D deficiency. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. Ergocalciferol is available as a generic medication and over the counter. In 2017, it was the 55th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States. Ergocalciferol may be used as a vitamin D supplement, whereas cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) is produced naturally by the skin when exposed to ultraviolet light.  Ergocalciferol (D2) and cholecalciferol (D3) are considered to be equivalent for vitamin D production, as both forms appear to have similar efficacy in ameliorating rickets. Ergocalciferol is believed to attach to the same receptor as vitamin D2 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (cholecalciferol). Like cholecalciferol, Ergocalciferol is inactive by itself. It requires two hydroxylations to become active: the first in the liver by CYP2R1 to form 25-hydroxyergocalciferol (ercalcidiol or 25-OH D2[18]), and the second in the kidney by CYP27B1, to form the active 1,25-dihydroxyergocalciferol,",HMDB0001438,C[C@H](\C=C\[C@H](C)C(O)(C)C)C1CC[C@@]2([H])\C(CCC[C@]12C)=C\C=C1\C[C@@H](O)CCC1=C,C28H44O2,"1S/C28H44O2/c1-19-10-14-24(29)18-23(19)13-12-22-8-7-17-28(6)25(15-16-26(22)28)20(2)9-11-21(3)27(4,5)30/h9,11-13,20-21,24-26,29-30H,1,7-8,10,14-18H2,2-6H3/b11-9+,22-12+,23-13-/t20-,21+,24+,25?,26+,28-/m1/s1",KJKIIUAXZGLUND-BJWBXCNSSA-N,"(1S,3Z)-3-{2-[(3aS,4E,7aR)-1-[(2R,3E,5S)-6-hydroxy-5,6-dimethylhept-3-en-2-yl]-7a-methyl-octahydro-1H-inden-4-ylidene]ethylidene}-4-methylidenecyclohexan-1-ol",5.657397239333335,19.043212677718646,412.6478,412.334130652,2.04e-03 g/l,6.53,-5.31,2,2,5,40.46,130.6488,51.24695692923244,25-hydroxyvitamin D,0,0,-0.8498853053671976,18.384341369959035,1,3,0,0,0,0,MDB00000615,"5333,5398,5472,5514"

In addition to this non-enzymatic route, cyanide produced in vivo can be converted in part to thiocyanate by sulfur transferase systems. The thiocyanate ion can be oxidized at acid pH by hydrogen peroxide to generate sulfate and cyanide. The reaction is catalyzed by hemoglobin acting as a peroxidase.

Vanylglycol is found in the brain, blood, CSF, and urine, where its concentrations are used to measure catecholamine turnover. Alcohol consumption increases the level of MHPG in urine and CSF. Catecholamines play an important role in platelet activation and aggregation, epinephrine being the most potent one. Catecholamines are substantially increased during stress, exercise or smoking and could result in clinically important platelet activation if their action was not rapidly regulated. Alcohol dehydrogenase has been shown to act on norepinephrine and produce MHPG.

345,20-Hydroxy-leukotriene B4,"20-hydroxy- Leukotriene B4 (20-OH-LTB4) is an omega-hydroxylated metabolite of leukotriene B4 found in human neutrophils. Elevated urinary concentrations of 20-OH-LTB4 and LTB4 are found in patients with Sjogren-Larsson syndrome (SLS, OMIM 270220), an autosomal recessively inherited neurocutaneous disorder caused by a deficiency of the microsomal enzyme fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH), which as an essential role in LTB4 metabolism. Preterm birth seems to be one of the features of the syndrome. The reason for the preterm birth is unclear. It is hypothesized that it relates to the defective LTB4 degradation in SLS. The pathological urinary excretion of LTB4 and 20-OH-LTB4 is a biochemical marker for SLS. Surprisingly, 20-OH-LTB4 concentrations are normal in CSF. Leukotriene B4 is the major metabolite in neutrophil polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Leukotrienes are metabolites of arachidonic acid derived from the action of 5-LO (5-lipoxygenase). The immediate product of 5-LO is LTA4 (leukotriene A4), which is enzymatically converted into either LTB4 (leukotriene B4) by LTA4 hydrolase or LTC4 (leukotriene C4) by LTC4 synthase. The regulation of leukotriene production occurs at various levels, including expression of 5-LO, translocation of 5-LO to the perinuclear region and phosphorylation to either enhance or inhibit the activity of 5-LO. Biologically active LTB4 is metabolized by w-oxidation carried out by specific cytochrome P450s (CYP4F) followed by beta-oxidation from the w-carboxy position and after CoA ester formation. Other specific pathways of leukotriene metabolism include the 12-hydroxydehydrogenase/ 15-oxo-prostaglandin-13-reductase that form a series of conjugated diene metabolites that have been observed to be excreted into human urine. Metabolism of LTC4 occurs by sequential peptide cleavage reactions involving a gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase that forms LTD4 (leukotriene D4) and a membrane-bound dipeptidase that converts LTD4 into LTE4 (leukotriene E4) before w-oxidation. These metabolic transformations of the primary leukotrienes are critical for termination of their biological activity, and defects in expression of participating enzymes may be involved in specific genetic disease. (PMID: 12709426, 9799565, 11408337, 17623009)' - Leukotrienes are eicosanoids. The eicosanoids consist of the prostaglandins (PGs), thromboxanes (TXs), leukotrienes (LTs) and lipoxins (LXs). The PGs and TXs are collectively identified as prostanoids. Prostaglandins were originally shown to be synthesized in the prostate gland, thromboxanes from platelets (thrombocytes) and leukotrienes from leukocytes, hence the derivation of their names. All mammalian cells except erythrocytes synthesize eicosanoids. These molecules are extremely potent, able to cause profound physiological effects at very dilute concentrations. All eicosanoids function locally at the site of synthesis, through receptor-mediated G-protein linked signaling pathways.↵",HMDB0001509,OCCCCC\C=C/C[C@@H](O)\C=C\C=C\C=C/[C@@H](O)CCCC(O)=O,C20H32O5,"1S/C20H32O5/c21-17-10-6-2-1-3-7-12-18(22)13-8-4-5-9-14-19(23)15-11-16-20(24)25/h3-5,7-9,13-14,18-19,21-23H,1-2,6,10-12,15-17H2,(H,24,25)/b5-4+,7-3-,13-8+,14-9-/t18-,19-/m1/s1",PTJFJXLGRSTECQ-PSPARDEHSA-N,"(5S,6Z,8E,10E,12R,14Z)-5,12,20-trihydroxyicosa-6,8,10,14-tetraenoic acid",2.688870060333332,16.843936486031904,352.4651,352.224974134,3.30e-02 g/l,4.22,-4.03,5,4,15,97.99000000000001,104.91369999999999,40.46273183675189,20-hydroxy-LTB4,0,-1,-1.1987619626600479,4.646345072403522,1,0,1,1,0,0,MDB00000634,

However, MG also exhibits anti-inflammatory effects (PMID: 14744621). Methylguanidine is synthesized from creatinine concomitant with the synthesis of hydrogen peroxide from endogenous substrates in peroxisomes. Recent evidence suggests that methylguanidine significantly inhibits iNOS activity and TNF- release.

347,3-Methylthiopropionic acid,"3-Methylthiopropionic acid, also known as 3-(methylsulfanyl)propanoate or 3-methylthiopropanoate or 3-MTP or MTPA, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as straight chain fatty acids. These are fatty acids with a straight aliphatic chain. 3-methylthiopropionate is also classified as a thia fatty acid and consists of propionic acid with a methylthio substituent at the 3- position. It is a byproduct of methionine metabolism. In particular, methionine is catabolized via transamination and subsequent decarboxylation of the keto acid to 3-MTP. Rats fed high quantities of 3-MTP exhibit toxicity symptoms (darkened spleen, growth stunting) which is identical to methionine toxicity (PMID: 100496). The existence of 3-MTP highlights the fact that the preferred pathway for methioinine metabolism in mammals is via transamination, as opposed to transsulfuration.  Levels of 3-MTP in urine are significantly increased in patients suffering liver cirrhosis. (PMID: 3997054). In addition to being a mammalian metabolite of methionine, 3-MTP is also produced by plant pathogens and is the simplest known phytotoxin.

348,Asymmetric Dimethyl-L-arginine,"Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is a modified form of arginine. Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and its enantiomer, Symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA), are naturally occurring amino acids that were first isolated and characterized in human urine in 1970. They are post-translationally modified forms of arginine generated during normal protein turnover (PMID: 31357472). ADMA is a known uremic toxin as determined by the European Uremic Toxin Work Group (EUTox) (PMID: 12675874). ADMA is a metabolic by-product of continual protein modification processes in the cytoplasm of all human cells. It is closely related to L-arginine, a conditionally-essential amino acid. ADMA interferes with L-arginine in the production of nitric oxide, a key chemical to endothelial, and hence cardiovascular health. ADMA is created via protein methylation, a common mechanism of post-translational protein modification. This reaction is catalyzed by an enzyme set called S-adenosylmethionine protein N-methyltransferases (protein methylases I and II). The methyl groups transferred to create ADMA are derived from the methyl group donor S-adenosylmethionine, an intermediate in the metabolism of homocysteine. (Homocysteine is an important blood chemical, because it is also a marker of cardiovascular disease). After synthesis, ADMA migrates into the extracellular space and then into blood plasma. ADMA is the most potent endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), with higher levels in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). ADMA has shown to be a significant predictor of cardiovascular outcome and mortality among dialysis patients. (PMID 12401860).

350,D-Ribose 5-phosphate,"D-Ribose 5-phosphate also known as R5P or Ribose 5-phosphoric acid, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as pentose phosphates. These are carbohydrate derivatives containing a pentose substituted by one or more phosphate groups. R5P consists of a five-carbon sugar, ribose, and a phosphate group at the five-position carbon. R5 is both a product and an intermediate of the pentose phosphate pathway. The last step of the oxidative reactions in the pentose phosphate pathway is the production of ribulose 5-phosphate. Depending on the body's state, ribulose 5-phosphate can reversibly isomerize to ribose 5-phosphate. R5P is produced in the pentose phosphate pathway in all organisms. The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is a metabolic pathway that runs parallel to glycolysis. It is a crucial source for NADPH generation for reductive biosynthesis. When demand for NADPH and R5P is balanced, G6P forms one Ru5P molecule through the PPP, generating two NADPH molecules and one R5P molecule. When more R5P is needed than NADPH, R5P can be formed through glycolytic intermediates. Glucose 6-phosphate is converted to fructose 6-phosphate (F6P) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) during glycolysis. Transketolase and transaldolase convert two molecules of F6P and one molecule of G3P to three molecules of R5P. R5P and its derivatives serve as precursors to many biomolecules, including DNA, RNA, ATP, coenzyme A, FAD (Flavin adenine dinucleotide), and histidine. A number of diseases have been linked to R5P imbalances in cells. Cancers and tumors show upregulated production of R5P correlated to increased RNA and DNA synthesis. Ribose 5-phosphate isomerase deficiency, one of the rarest diseases in the world, is also linked to an imbalance of R5P.",HMDB0001548,OC1O[C@H](COP(O)(O)=O)[C@@H](O)[C@H]1O,C5H11O8P,"1S/C5H11O8P/c6-3-2(1-12-14(9,10)11)13-5(8)4(3)7/h2-8H,1H2,(H2,9,10,11)/t2-,3-,4-,5?/m1/s1",KTVPXOYAKDPRHY-SOOFDHNKSA-N,"{[(2R,3S,4R,5S)-3,4,5-trihydroxyoxolan-2-yl]methoxy}phosphonic acid",-2.425770307333333,6.248502666590344,230.1098,230.01915384,3.36e+01 g/l,-2.07,-0.84,7,5,3,136.68,40.8338,18.250781635212405,α-D-ribose 5-phosphate,0,-2,-3.680084519580305,1.2226866612133929,1,1,1,0,0,0,MDB00000648,"5183,5269"

353,D-Xylulose,"D-Xylulose is a monosaccharide containing five carbon atoms. Xylulose exists in both the D and L forms, and both are found in nature. D-xylulose is converted from xylitol by the enzyme NAD+-linked xylitol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.9) in the glucuronate pathway, the most important xylitol-handling metabolic pathway in mammals. This activity has been described in human erythrocytes. Most likely, D-xylulose (as well as D-arabinose or D-ribulose) is a precursor of the pentiol known as D-arabitol, since pentitols are derived from their corresponding pentose phosphate precursors via pentoses. This pathway can play a role in inherited metabolic disorders underlying the accumulation of pentitols e.g., ribose 5-phosphate isomerase deficiency and transaldolase deficiency. L-Xylulose accumulates in the urine in patients with pentosuria, due to a deficiency in the enzyme L-xylulose reductase. Since L-xylulose is a reducing sugar like D-glucose, pentosuria patients have sometimes been wrongly diagnosed in the past to be diabetic. Although pentitols are present in all living organisms, knowledge concerning their metabolism is limited.

354,Acetone,"Acetone, or propanone, is an organic compound with the formula (CH3)2CO. It is the simplest and smallest ketone. It is a colourless, highly volatile and flammable liquid with a characteristic pungent odour. Acetone is miscible with water and serves as an important organic solvent in its own right, in industry, home, and laboratory. Acetone is produced and disposed of in the human body through normal metabolic processes. It is normally present in blood and urine. People with diabetic ketoacidosis produce it in larger amounts. Acetone is not regarded as a waste product of metabolism. However, its physiological role in biochemical machinery is not clear. Certain health conditions, such as alcoholism and diabetes, can produce ketoacidosis, uncontrollable ketosis that leads to a sharp, and potentially fatal, increase in the acidity of the blood.  A model for the role of acetone metabolism is presented that orders the events occurring in acetonemia in sequence: in diabetic ketosis or starvation, ketone body production (b-hydroxy-butyrate, acetoacetate) provides fuel for vital organs (heart, brain, among others) raising the chance of survival of the metabolic catastrophe. However, when ketone body production exceeds the degrading capacity, the accumulating acetoacetic acid presents a new challenge to the pH regulatory system. Acetone production and its further degradation to C3 fragments fulfill two purposes: the maintenance of pH buffering capacity and provision of fuel for peripheral tissues. Since ketosis develops under serious metabolic circumstances, all the mechanisms that balance or moderate the effects of ketosis enhance the chance for survival. From this point of view, the theory that transportable C3 fragments can serve as additional nutrients is a novel view of acetone metabolism which introduces a new approach to the study of acetone degradation, especially in understanding its physiological function and the interrelationship between liver and peripheral tissues. (PMID 10580530 ). Acetone is typically derived from acetoacetate through the action of microbial acetoacetate decarboxylases found in gut microflora. In chemistry, acetone is the simplest representative of the ketones. Acetone is a colorless, mobile, flammable liquid readily soluble in water, ethanol, ether, etc., and itself serves as an important solvent. It is an irritant and inhalation may lead to hepatotoxic effects (causing liver damage). Acetone can be found in Clostridium (PMID: 685531). Certain dietary patterns, including prolonged fasting and high-fat low-carbohydrate dieting, can produce ketosis, in which acetone is formed in body tissue. Acetone is an important marker for Type I diabetes where adults (>18 years old) with diabetes have an elevated level of acetone in the urine at a concentration of 13.2 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 6321058) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 3.9 (0.8-17.6) μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 24023812). Acetone is associated with kidney disease and this is seen in adults (>18 years old) with kidney disease who have elevated levels of acetone in the blood at a concentration of 25.0 - 85.0 μM (PMID: 914932) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 106.0 (35.0-170.0) μM (PMID: 1787157).",HMDB0001659,CC(C)=O,C3H6O,1S/C3H6O/c1-3(2)4/h1-2H3,CSCPPACGZOOCGX-UHFFFAOYSA-N,propan-2-one,0.1062798083333333,,58.0791,58.041864814,1.93e+02 g/l,-0.29,0.52,1,0,0,17.07,16.1948,6.408374755692414,acetone,0,0,-7.194665505565277,19.511239590750403,1,0,1,0,1,0,MDB00000657,"5199,5202,5229,5256,5260,5264,5312,5338,5440,5441,5468"
355,Progesterone,"Progesterone is a C-21 steroid hormone involved in the female menstrual cycle, pregnancy (supports gestation) and embryogenesis of humans and other species. Progesterone belongs to a class of hormones called progestagens, and is the major naturally occurring human progestagen. It is the major progestational steroid that is secreted primarily by the corpus luteum and the placenta. Progesterone acts on the uterus, the mammary glands and the brain. It is required in embryo implantation, pregnancy maintenance, and the development of mammary tissue for milk production. Progesterone, converted from pregnenolone, also serves as an intermediate in the biosynthesis of gonadal steroid hormones and adrenal corticosteroids.  During implantation and gestation, progesterone appears to decrease the maternal immune response to allow for the acceptance of the pregnancy. Progesterone decreases contractility of the uterine smooth muscle. The fetus metabolizes placental progesterone in the production of adrenal mineralo- and glucosteroids. A reduction in progesterone levels is possibly one step that facilitates the onset of labor. In addition, progesterone inhibits lactation during pregnancy. The drop in progesterone levels following delivery is one of the triggers for milk production in humans and other mammals. Progesterone, like pregnenolone and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), belongs to an important group of endogenous steroids called neurosteroids. Neurosteroids are neuromodulators, and are neuroprotective, neurogenic, and regulate neurotransmission and myelination. Progesterone enhances the function of serotonin receptors in the brain, so an excess or deficit of progesterone has the potential to result in significant neurochemical issues. This provides an explanation for why some people resort to substances that enhance serotonin activity such as nicotine, alcohol, and cannabis when their progesterone levels fall below optimal levels. progesterone supports the normal development of neurons in the brain, and that the hormone has a protective effect on damaged brain tissue. It has been observed in animal models that females have reduced susceptibility to traumatic brain injury and this protective effect has been hypothesized to be caused by increased circulating levels of estrogen and progesterone in females. In addition to its role as a natural hormone, progesterone is also used as a medication, such as in menopausal hormone therapy.",HMDB0001830,[H][C@@]12CC[C@H](C(C)=O)[C@@]1(C)CC[C@@]1([H])[C@@]2([H])CCC2=CC(=O)CC[C@]12C,C21H30O2,"1S/C21H30O2/c1-13(22)17-6-7-18-16-5-4-14-12-15(23)8-10-20(14,2)19(16)9-11-21(17,18)3/h12,16-19H,4-11H2,1-3H3/t16-,17+,18-,19-,20-,21+/m0/s1",RJKFOVLPORLFTN-LEKSSAKUSA-N,"(1S,2R,10S,11S,14S,15S)-14-acetyl-2,15-dimethyltetracyclo[8.7.0.0^{2,7}.0^{11,15}]heptadec-6-en-5-one",4.148604400666667,19.56485432524616,314.4617,314.224580204,5.46e-03 g/l,3.58,-4.76,2,0,1,34.14,92.7053,37.255973123562505,"(1S,2R,10S,11S,14S,15S)-14-acetyl-2,15-dimethyltetracyclo[8.7.0.0^{2,7}.0^{11,15}]heptadec-6-en-5-one",0,0,-4.816188745344462,18.916312523139567,1,4,1,1,1,0,MDB00000660,"5338,5404,5465,5466"

357,Methylsuccinic acid,"Methylsuccinic acid (CAS: 498-21-5), also known as 2-Methylsuccinic acid is a dicarboxylic acid and is a normal metabolite found in human fluids. Increased urinary levels of methylsuccinic acid (together with ethylmalonic acid) are the main biochemical measurable features in ethylmalonic encephalopathy (OMIM: 602473 ), a rare metabolic disorder with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance that is clinically characterized by neuromotor delay, hyperlactic acidemia, recurrent petechiae, orthostatic acrocyanosis, and chronic diarrhea (PMID:12382164 ). The underlying biochemical defect involves isoleucine catabolism (PMID:9667231 ). Methylsuccinic acid levels were found to have decreased in the urine of animals under D-serine-induced nephrotoxicity (D-serine causes selective necrosis of the proximal straight tubules in the rat kidney) (PMID:15596249). Moreover, methylsuccinic acid is found to be associated with ethylmalonic encephalopathy, isovaleric acidemia, and medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, which are also inborn errors of metabolism. In children (1-13 years old) with ethylmalonic encephalopathy, methylsuccinic acid is elevated in the urine at a concentration of 7.2 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 16828325) compared to normal children at a concentration of 2.8 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 8087979). In children (1-13 years old) with isovaleric acidemia, methylsuccinic acid is reduced in the urine at a concentration of 1.100-5.900 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 19343532) compared to normal children at a concentration of 2.8 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 8087979).

358,Caffeine,"Caffeine is a methyl xanthine alkaloid that is also classified as a purine.  Caffeine is chemically related to the adenine and guanine bases of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). It is found in the seeds, nuts, or leaves of a number of plants native to Africa, East Asia and South America,  and helps to protect them against predator insects and to prevent germination of nearby seeds. The most well-known source of caffeine is the coffee bean, Caffeine is the most widely consumed psychostimulant drug in the world. 85% of American adults consumed some form of caffeine daily, consuming 164 mg on average. Caffeine is mostly is consumed in the form of coffee. Caffeine is a central nervous system stimulant that reduces fatigue and drowsiness. At normal doses, caffeine has variable effects on learning and memory, but it generally improves reaction time, wakefulness, concentration, and motor coordination. Caffeine is a proven ergogenic aid in humans.  Caffeine improves athletic performance in aerobic (especially endurance sports) and anaerobic conditions. Moderate doses of caffeine (around 5 mg/kg[41]) can improve sprint performance, cycling and running time trial performance, endurance and cycling power output. At intake levels associated with coffee consumption, caffeine appears to exert most of its biological effects through the antagonism of the A1 and A2A subtypes of the adenosine receptor. Adenosine is an endogenous neuromodulator with mostly inhibitory effects, and adenosine antagonism by caffeine results in effects that are generally stimulatory. Some physiological effects associated with caffeine administration include central nervous system stimulation, acute elevation of blood pressure, increased metabolic rate, and diuresis. A number of in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that caffeine modulates both innate and adaptive immune responses. For instance, studies indicate that caffeine and its major metabolite paraxanthine suppress neutrophil and monocyte chemotaxis, and also suppress production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha from human blood. Caffeine has also been reported to suppress human lymphocyte function as indicated by reduced T-cell proliferation and impaired production of Th1 (interleukin [IL]-2 and interferon [IFN]-gamma), Th2 (IL-4, IL-5) and Th3 (IL-10) cytokines. Studies also indicate that caffeine suppresses antibody production. The evidence suggests that at least some of the immunomodulatory actions of caffeine are mediated via inhibition of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-phosphodiesterase (PDE), and consequential increase in intracellular cAMP concentrations. Overall, these studies indicate that caffeine, like other members of the methylxanthine family, is largely anti-inflammatory in nature, and based on the pharmacokinetics of caffeine, many of its immunomodulatory effects occur at concentrations that are relevant to normal human consumption. (PMID 16540173). Caffeine is rapidly and almost completely absorbed in the stomach and small intestine and distributed to all tissues, including the brain. Caffeine metabolism occurs primarily in the liver, where the activity of the cytochrome P450 isoform CYP1A2 accounts for almost 95% of the primary metabolism of caffeine. CYP1A2-catalyzed 3-demethylation of caffeine results in the formation of 1,7-dimethylxanthine (paraxanthine). Paraxanthine may be demethylated by CYP1A2 to form 1-methylxanthine, which may be oxidized to 1-methyluric acid by xanthine oxidase. Paraxanthine may also be hydroxylated by CYP2A6 to form 1,7-dimethyluric acid, or acetylated by N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) to form 5-acetylamino-6-formylamino-3-methyluracil, an unstable compound that may be deformylated nonenzymatically to form 5-acetylamino-6-amino-3-methyluracil. Caffeine concentrations in coffee beverages can be quite variable. A standard cup of coffee is often assumed to provide 100 mg of caffeine, but a recent analysis of 14 different specialty coffees purchased at coffee shops in the US found that the amount of caffeine in 8 oz (=240 ml) of brewed coffee ranged from 72 to 130 mg. Caffeine in espresso coffees ranged from 58 to 76 mg in a single shot.

360,"1,3-Dimethyluric acid","1,3-Dimethyluric acid is a methylated purine derivative. It is a product of both caffeine and theophylline metabolism in man. Caffeine is found in coffee, tea, cocoa and soft drinks. Theophylline occurs naturally in black tea and in green coffee beans. It is also the active component in several drugs used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. 1,3-Dimethyluric acid is one of the purine components found in urinary calculi. Methylated purines originate from the metabolism of methylxanthines (caffeine, theophylline and theobromine). 1,3-Dimethyluric acid as measured in urine can be used as a biomarker for CYP450 enzyme activity (and other drug metabolic enzymes) when surrogate or proxy drugs (such as caffeine, theophylline and theobromine) are provided (PMID: 31430927). For instance, caffeine is metabolized via successive pathways mainly catalyzed by CYP1A2, xanthine oxidase or N-acetyltransferase-2 to give 14 different metabolites. CYP1A2 activity shows an inter-individual variability among the population. CYP1A2, an isoform of the CYP1A cytochrome P450 super-family, is involved in the metabolism of many drugs and plays a potentially important role in the induction of chemical carcinogenesis.

361,p-Cresol,"p-Cresol, also known as 4-methylphenol, is a volatile low-molecular-weight compound. It belongs to the class of compounds known as phenols. Phenols are alcohols containing a benzene ring. p-Cresol is excreted in sweat, urine and feces in most mammals. It is also a component of human sweat that attracts mosquitos (PMID: 2577519). p-Cresol is a constituent of tobacco smoke and a major component of pig odor (PMID: 21556207). p-Cresol is also a pheromone that is used to attract the orchid bee. In humans, p-Cresol is a known uremic toxin. Uremic toxins are compounds found in blood that are normally eliminated in urine but when present in blood in high levels can cause a damage to organs or tissues. p-Cresol is an end-product of protein breakdown via the action of gut microbiota. More specifically, p-Cresol is one of the metabolites of the amino acid tyrosine, and to a lesser extent phenylalanine, which are converted to 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid by intestinal bacteria, before being decarboxylated to p-Cresol (putrefaction). The main contributing bacteria are aerobes (mainly enterobacteria), but to a certain extent also anaerobes play a role (mainly Clostridium perfringens). In uremia, modifications in the intestinal flora result in the specific overgrowth of bacteria that are specific p-Cresol producers. The administration of antibiotics reduces urinary excretion of p-Cresol, as a result of the elimination of the offending bacteria. p-Cresol is a somewhat lipophilic moiety which strongly binds to plasma proteins, especially serum albumin (close to 100%) under normal conditions. p-Cresol can be further metabolized through conjugation, mainly sulphation and glucuronization, but removal of the unconjugated p-Cresol is done, at least in part, via excretion in urine. p-Cresol can also serve as a marker for exposure to toluene. Cytochrome P450 enzymes metabolize toluene to benzyl alcohol, but also to o-Cresol and p-Cresol. Toluene is a widely used industrial solvent and is also the most widely abused inhaled solvent. In addition to being a metabolite of toluene, p-Cresol is also a metabolite of menthofuran, which is derived from Pennyroyal oil. Pennyroyal oil is extensively used for its pleasant mint-like smell in the flavoring industry. The toxicity of {ennyroyal oil and menthofuran is well known. Another compound used in traditional medicine, especially in Japan, which is a precursor of p-cresol, is wood tar creosote. p-Cresol has been reported to affect several biochemical, biological and physiological functions: (i) it diminishes the oxygen uptake of rat cerebral cortex slices; (ii) it increases the free active drug concentration of warfarin and diazepam; (iii) it has been related to growth retardation in the weanling pig; (iv) it alters cell membrane permeability, at least in bacteria; (v) it induces LDH leakage from rat liver slices; (vi) it induces susceptibility to auditive epileptic crises; and (vii) it blocks cell K+ channels.

362,Benzoic acid,"Benzoic acid, is a member of the class of compounds known as aromatic carboxylic acids. It is a colourless crystalline solid and the simplest aromatic carboxylic acid. Benzoic acid occurs naturally in many plants and serves as an intermediate in the biosynthesis of many secondary metabolites.  Appreciable amounts of benzoic acid have been found in many berries (around 0.05%). Cranberries contain as much as 300-1300 mg free benzoic acid per kg of fruit. Industrially, benzoic acid is a fungistatic compound that is widely used as a food preservative. Benzoic acid can also be found in animal species. When inside the body benzoic acid is often is conjugated to glycine in the liver and excreted as hippuric acid. Benzoic acid is a byproduct of phenylalanine metabolism in bacteria. It is also produced when gut bacteria process polyphenols (from ingested fruits or beverages).↵",HMDB0001870,OC(=O)C1=CC=CC=C1,C7H6O2,"1S/C7H6O2/c8-7(9)6-4-2-1-3-5-6/h1-5H,(H,8,9)",WPYMKLBDIGXBTP-UHFFFAOYSA-N,benzoic acid,1.630828724,,122.1213,122.036779436,7.08e+00 g/l,1.72,-1.24,2,1,1,37.3,33.3142,11.97308273996681,benzoic acid,0,-1,,4.07523327743486,1,1,1,0,1,0,MDB00000680,

It is a light, volatile, colourless, flammable, poisonous liquid with a distinctive odor that is somewhat milder and sweeter than ethanol Methanol is highly toxic. As little as 10 mL of pure methanol can cause permanent blindness by destruction of the optic nerve. 30 mL is potentially fatal. Methanol toxicity arises via two mechanisms. First, methanol is a central nervous system depressant. Second, it is metabolized to formic acid which inhibits mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase, causing hypoxia at the cellular level, and metabolic acidosis. When ingested methanol is metabolised to formaldehyde through the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase in the liver and formaldehyde is converted to formic acid via aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). The conversion to formate via ALDH proceeds completely, with no detectable formaldehyde remaining. The quantitative measurement of specific serum levels of methanol using gas chromatography is expensive, time consuming (PMID 15862085). Urinary methanol and formic acid can serve as biomarkers of occupational exposure to methyl formate (PMID: 11007345).",HMDB0001875,CO,CH4O,"1S/CH4O/c1-2/h2H,1H3",OKKJLVBELUTLKV-UHFFFAOYSA-N,methanol,-0.5185770686666668,,32.0419,32.02621475,5.19e+02 g/l,-1.38,1.21,1,1,0,20.23,8.2613,3.3823377787776097,methanol,0,0,-2.459555527725798,15.775593215075904,1,0,1,0,1,0,MDB00000683,"5467,5468"
365,Propylene glycol,"Propylene glycol (1,2-propanediol) is a diol alcohol. It is usually a tasteless, odorless, and colorless clear oily liquid that is hygroscopic and miscible with water, acetone, and chloroform. It is manufactured by the hydration of propylene oxide. Propylene glycol is commonly found in cosmetics and many packaged foods, such as drink mixes, dressings, dried soups, cake mix, soft drinks, popcorn, food coloring, fast foods, bread and dairy products. In food applications, propylene glycole preserves moisture in products and helps dissolve colors and flavors. It is also used as an anti-caking agent, an antioxidant, a dough strengthener, a thickener, a stabilizer, an emulsifier and a preservative. Propylene glycol is also used as a solvent for many intravenous, oral, and topical pharmaceutical preparations. It is generally considered safe. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a maximum consumption of 25 mg/kg/day (1.8 g/day for a 75 kg male) of propylene glycol when used as a food additive, but this limit does not address its use as a drug solvent. No maximum dose is recommended in the literature for intravenous therapy with propylene glycol. Intoxication occurs at much higher doses than the WHO dose limit and is exclusive to pharmacologic exposure. However, in large doses propylene glycol can be toxic, especially if given over a short period of time. In adults with normal liver and kidney function, the terminal half-life of propylene glycol ranges from 1.4 to 3.3 hours. Propylene glycol is metabolized by the liver to form lactate, acetate, and pyruvate. The nonmetabolized compound is normally excreted in the urine mainly as a glucuronide conjugate. Approximately 12 to 45 percent is excreted unchanged in urine. Renal clearance of propylene glycol decreases as the dose administered increases (390 ml/minute/173 m2 at a dose of 5 g/day but only 144 ml/minute/173 m2 at a dose of 21 g/day). These data suggest that renal clearance declines at higher propylene glycol doses because of saturation of proximal tubular secretion of the drug. Propylene glycol toxicity includes development of serum hyperosmolality, lactic acidosis, and kidney failure. It has been suggested that proximal tubular necrosis is the cause of acute kidney injury from propylene glycol. Along these lines, proximal tubular cell injury occurs in cultured human cells exposed to propylene glycol. Acute tubular necrosis was described with propylene glycol toxicity in a case of concomitant administration of intravenous lorazepam and trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole. Propylene glycol induced intoxication can also mimic sepsis or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Patients suspected of having sepsis with negative cultures should be evaluated for propylene glycol toxicity if they have been exposed to high dose lorazepam (which contains the most propylene glycol of any drug) or other medications containing this solvent.

366,3-Chlorotyrosine,"3-Chlorotyrosine, also known as 3-Chloro-L-tyrosine, is a chloroamino acid consisting of a tyrosine core with a chloro- substituent ortho to the phenolic hydroxy group. It is a specific biomarker of the neutrophil oxidant hypochlorous acid. Hypochlorous acid chlorinates tyrosyl residues in small peptides and proteins to produce 3-Chlorotyrosine (PMID: 8566218). Hypochlorous acid is produced by the enzyme myeloperoxidase. Therefore 3-Chlorotyrosine is a specific marker of myeloperoxidase-catalyzed oxidation. Myeloperoxidase is the only human enzyme known to generate hypochlorous acid (HOCl), a potent oxidizing agent, at physiological halide concentrations. Human neutrophils convert L-tyrosine to 3-Chlorotyrosine, through the action of myeloperoxidase and Cl2 in the phagolysosome.  3-Chorotyrosine is markedly elevated in low density lipoprotein (LDL) isolated from human atherosclerotic intima.

368,Alpha-Tocopherol,"Alpha-tocopherol is a common form of vitamin E. It is a lipid-like molecule with a chromane ring that contains a hydroxyl group that can donate a hydrogen atom to reduce free radicals. α-Tocopherol has three stereocenters, so it is a chiral molecule. The eight stereoisomers of α-tocopherol differ in the configuration of these stereocenters. RRR-α-tocopherol is the natural one. Alpha-tocopherol is traditionally recognized as the most active form of vitamin E in humans, and is a powerful biological antioxidant. Natural vitamin E exists in eight different forms or isomers, four tocopherols and four tocotrienols. In foods, the most abundant sources of vitamin E are vegetable oils such as palm oil, sunflower, corn, soybean and olive oil. Nuts, sunflower seeds, and wheat germ are also good sources. Alpha-tocopherol boosts the immune system and helps keep blood clots from forming. It also helps prevent cell damage caused by free radicals (highly reactive chemicals). The measurement of ""vitamin E"" activity in international units (IU) was based on fertility enhancement by the prevention of spontaneous abortions in pregnant rats relative to alpha tocopherol.

369,Substance P,"Substance P (SP), is an 11-amino acid neuropeptide with the amino acid sequence: RPKPQQFFGLM. SP is a member of the tachykinin family of peptides because it induces rapid smooth muscle contraction in guinea pig ileum and rat duodenum. Other members of the tachykinin family that share the common carboxyl terminal Phe-X-Gly-Leu-met-NH2 sequences, include neurokinin A and neurokinin B. In mammals, tachykinins are produced by two genes, preprotachykinin-A (PPT-A) and preprotachykinin-B (PPT-B), and SP is a product of the PPT-A gene. SP is localized in the central nervous system as well as in several peripheral tissues, including the entire length of the gastrointestinal tract as well as the colon. The main sources of SP in the gut include the myenteric and submucosal plexus, intrinsic sensory neurons, as well as sensory neurons originating from the dorsal root ganglia. A newly identified gene, preprotachykinin C gene, encodes for the sequence of a new preprotachykinin protein designated hemokinin (HK) and produced primarily by hematopoietic cells. HK binds with high selectivity to NK-1R and has similar in vivo potency to SP. Like SP, HK is an 11-amino acid peptide having ~55% amino acid similarity to SP. The effects of SP are mediated by three different G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), namely neurokinin (NK)-1, 2, and 3. SP binds with high affinity to NK-1 receptor (NK-1R), and with low affinity to NK-2 and 3 receptors. NK-1 receptors are present in both small intestine and colon of animals and humans and are localized in a variety of cells, including nerves, smooth muscle, immune cells, glands, endothelial cells, as well as epithelial cells. Although NK-1 receptors have been associated with several intestinal pathophysiologic conditions (see below), NK-2 receptors have been linked mostly with circular muscle contraction, and are localized in circular muscle and muscularis mucosae. Although NK-2 receptors are present predominantly on smooth muscle and, like NK-1, can affect gut motility, NK-3 receptors are expressed predominantly in neurons and can stimulate or diminish muscle contraction indirectly following SP binding to neuronal cells in the submucosal and myenteric nerve plexuses of the gastrointestinal tract. NK-3 receptors also provide slow excitatory synaptic input to neurons in ganglia of the sphincter of Oddi. Thus, both NK-2 and NK-3 receptors affect motility responses in the GI, but there is very little evidence that they are involved in neuroimmune interactions.

370,3-Nitrotyrosine,"3-Nitrotyrosine (NTyr), also known as nitrotyrosine, is a nitrated version of the amino acid tyrosine. It is a product of tyrosine nitration mediated by reactive nitrogen species such as the peroxynitrite anion (ONOO−) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Nitrotyrosine is a biomarker of cell damage, inflammation as well as NO (nitric oxide) production. Reactive nitrogen species such as peroxynitrite can nitrate specific amino acids, whether free or protein bound, and 3-nitrotyrosine is believed to be one marker of this reaction. (PMID: 10833032). In many disease states oxidative stress increases the production of superoxide (O2−) and NO forming peroxynitrite (ONOO−) a well-known free radical oxidant (PMID: 9681984). Free 3-nitrotyrosine undergoes metabolism to form 3-nitro-4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (NHPA) which is excreted in the urine (PMID: 12797864). Increased levels of nitrotyrosine in various biofluids have been detected in cerebral ischemia, edema, rheumatoid arthritis, septic shock and celiac disease (PMID: 8062931, PMID: 9840741).

371,Digoxin,"Digoxin is a cardiac glycoside extracted from the foxglove plant, digitalis. Digoxin is widely used in the treatment of various heart conditions, namely atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter and congestive heart failure that cannot be controlled by other medication. Digoxin preparations are commonly marketed under the trade name Lanoxin. Digoxin has positive inotropic and negative chronotropic activity. It is used to control ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation and in the management of congestive heart failure with atrial fibrillation. The margin between toxic and therapeutic doses for digoxin is small. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p666). Digoxin binds to a site on the extracellular portion of the of the Na+/K+ ATPase pump in the membranes of heart cells (myocytes). This causes an increase in the level of sodium ions in the myocytes, which then leads to a rise in the level of calcium ions. The proposed mechanism is the following: inhibition of the Na+/K+ pump leads to increased Na+ levels, which in turn slows down the extrusion of Ca2+ via the Na+/Ca2+ exchange pump. Increased amounts of Ca2+ are then stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and released by each action potential, which is unchanged by digoxin. Owing to its narrow therapeutic index (the margin between effectiveness and toxicity), side effects of digoxin are inevitable. Nausea, vomiting and GIT upset are common, especially in higher doses. Decreased conduction in the AV node can lead to AV blocks, increased intracellular Ca2+ causes a type of arrhythmia called bigeminy (coupled beats), eventually ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. An often described but rarely seen side effect of digoxin is a disturbance of color vision (mostly yellow and green color) called xanthopsia.",HMDB0001917,[H][C@]12CC[C@]3([H])[C@]([H])(C[C@@H](O)[C@]4(C)[C@H](CC[C@]34O)C3=CC(=O)OC3)[C@@]1(C)CC[C@@H](C2)O[C@H]1C[C@H](O)[C@H](O[C@H]2C[C@H](O)[C@H](O[C@H]3C[C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@@H](C)O3)[C@@H](C)O2)[C@@H](C)O1,C41H64O14,"1S/C41H64O14/c1-19-36(47)28(42)15-34(50-19)54-38-21(3)52-35(17-30(38)44)55-37-20(2)51-33(16-29(37)43)53-24-8-10-39(4)23(13-24)6-7-26-27(39)14-31(45)40(5)25(9-11-41(26,40)48)22-12-32(46)49-18-22/h12,19-21,23-31,33-38,42-45,47-48H,6-11,13-18H2,1-5H3/t19-,20-,21-,23-,24+,25-,26-,27+,28+,29+,30+,31-,33+,34+,35+,36-,37-,38-,39+,40+,41+/m1/s1",LTMHDMANZUZIPE-PUGKRICDSA-N,"4-[(1S,2S,5S,7R,10R,11S,14R,15S,16R)-5-{[(2R,4S,5S,6R)-5-{[(2S,4S,5S,6R)-5-{[(2S,4S,5S,6R)-4,5-dihydroxy-6-methyloxan-2-yl]oxy}-4-hydroxy-6-methyloxan-2-yl]oxy}-4-hydroxy-6-methyloxan-2-yl]oxy}-11,16-dihydroxy-2,15-dimethyltetracyclo[8.7.0.0²,⁷.0¹¹,¹⁵]heptadecan-14-yl]-2,5-dihydrofuran-2-one",2.366680672000001,12.98355438761116,780.9385,780.429606756,1.27e-01 g/l,1.04,-3.79,13,6,7,203.05999999999997,193.2328,84.80330180640148,digoxin,0,0,-2.976075008150179,7.151115824532209,0,8,0,0,0,1,MDB00000706,5309
372,Tin,"Tin is a silvery metal and a trace element that is required in bone formation. Physiologically, tin exists as an ion in the body. It has the atomic symbol Sn, atomic number 50, and atomic weight 118.71. Inorganic tin salts are poorly absorbed and rapidly excreted in the feces; as a result they have a low toxicity. Only about 5 per cent of tin is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, then excreted by the kidney. Some tin is deposited in lung and bone. Some tin salts can cause renal necrosis after parenteral doses. Mutagenic studies on metallic tin and its compounds have been negative. Long-term animal carcinogenic studies have shown fewer malignant tumors in animals exposed to tin than in controls. Human volunteers developed mild signs of toxicity with tin, given in fruit juices, at a concentration of 1400 mg per litre. The WHO 1973 permissible limit for tin in tinned food is 250 micrograms per kg. The adult daily intake of tin was about 17 mg per day in 1940, but it has now decreased to about 3.5 mg, due to improvements in technique of tinning with enamel overcoat and crimped lids to minimize exposure to tin and lead solder. (PMID 3291572). Experimental studies over the last decade have suggested an association between thymus immune and homeostatic function and exogenous levels of tin. It has been hypothesized that the thymus gland synthesizes and secretes one or more tin bearing factors that enhance immune defenses against malignancy and retards the gradual loss of immune capacity with senescence.

373,Carbon dioxide,"Carbon dioxide is a colorless, odorless gas that can be formed by the body and is necessary for the respiration cycle of plants and animals. Carbon dioxide is produced during respiration by all animals, fungi and microorganisms that depend on living and decaying plants for food, either directly or indirectly. It is, therefore, a major component of the carbon cycle. Additionally, carbon dioxide is used by plants during photosynthesis to make sugars which may either be consumed again in respiration or used as the raw material to produce polysaccharides such as starch and cellulose, proteins and the wide variety of other organic compounds required for plant growth and development. When inhaled at concentrations much higher than usual atmospheric levels, it can produce a sour taste in the mouth and a stinging sensation in the nose and throat. These effects result from the gas dissolving in the mucous membranes and saliva, forming a weak solution of carbonic acid. Carbon dioxide is used by the food industry, the oil industry, and the chemical industry. Carbon dioxide is used to produce carbonated soft drinks and soda water. Traditionally, the carbonation in beer and sparkling wine comes about through natural fermentation, but some manufacturers carbonate these drinks artificially. Levels of carbon dioxide in the blood can be used to assess respiratory stress and health. CO2 exists in two forms in the body, bicarbonate (HCO3) and gaseous CO2. A blood CO2 test is used to determine the balance of CO2 and O2 in the blood or a pH imbalance (arising from bicarbonate). These imbalances can be signs of kidney, respiratory or metabolic disorders.",HMDB0001967,O=C=O,CO2,1S/CO2/c2-1-3,CURLTUGMZLYLDI-UHFFFAOYSA-N,methanedione,-0.27895710933333334,,44.0095,43.989829244,1.86e+02 g/l,-0.63,0.63,2,0,0,34.14,6.3844,2.5739427975841807,carbon dioxide,0,0,,,1,0,1,0,1,0,MDB00000728,5410
374,Vasopressin,"Vasopressin, also known as pitressin, argipressin, antidiuretic hormone (ADH) or arginine vasopressin (AVP), belongs to the class of organic compounds known as oligopeptides. These are organic compounds containing a sequence of between three and ten alpha-amino acids joined by peptide bonds. Vasopressin is an antidiuretic hormone. It is a nine amino acid peptide secreted from the posterior pituitary with the amino acid sequence: CYFQNCPRG. It is synthesized as a peptide prohormone in neurons in the hypothalamus, and is converted to AVP. It then travels down the axon of that cell, which terminates in the posterior pituitary, and is released from vesicles into the circulation in response to extracellular fluid hypertonicity (hyperosmolality). Within hypothalamic neurons, AVP is packaged in secretory vesicles with a carrier protein called neurophysin, and both are released upon hormone secretion. Vasopressin plays essential roles in the control of the body’s osmotic balance, blood pressure regulation, sodium homeostasis, and kidney function. Vasopressin induces differentiation of stem cells into cardiomyocytes and promotes heart muscle homeostasis. Some AVP may be released directly into the brain from the hypothalamus, and may play an important role in social behavior, sexual motivation and pair bonding, and maternal responses to stress. High levels of AVP can lead to a condition called Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone secretion (SIADH). Lung cancer can cause SIADH. Decreased levels of AVP can lead to diabetes insipidus, high levels of sodium in the blood and excess urine production.",HMDB0001980,NCCCCC(NC(=O)[C@@H]1CCCN1C(=O)[C@@H]1CSSC[C@H](N)C(=O)N[C@@H](CC2=CC=C(O)C=C2)C(=O)N[C@@H](CC2=CC=CC=C2)C(=O)N[C@@H](CCC(N)=O)C(=O)N[C@@H](CC(N)=O)C(=O)N1)C(=O)NCC(N)=O,C46H65N13O12S2,"1S/C46H65N13O12S2/c47-17-5-4-9-29(40(65)52-22-38(51)63)54-45(70)35-10-6-18-59(35)46(71)34-24-73-72-23-28(48)39(64)55-31(20-26-11-13-27(60)14-12-26)43(68)56-32(19-25-7-2-1-3-8-25)42(67)53-30(15-16-36(49)61)41(66)57-33(21-37(50)62)44(69)58-34/h1-3,7-8,11-14,28-35,60H,4-6,9-10,15-24,47-48H2,(H2,49,61)(H2,50,62)(H2,51,63)(H,52,65)(H,53,67)(H,54,70)(H,55,64)(H,56,68)(H,57,66)(H,58,69)/t28-,29?,30-,31-,32-,33-,34-,35-/m0/s1",BJFIDCADFRDPIO-ZCCHBGLBSA-N,"6-amino-2-{[(2S)-1-[(4R,7S,10S,13S,16S,19R)-19-amino-13-benzyl-10-(2-carbamoylethyl)-7-(carbamoylmethyl)-16-[(4-hydroxyphenyl)methyl]-6,9,12,15,18-pentaoxo-1,2-dithia-5,8,11,14,17-pentaazacycloicosane-4-carbonyl]pyrrolidin-2-yl]formamido}-N-(carbamoylmethyl)hexanamide",-6.77384258042907,11.457963844296293,1056.218,1055.431705989,4.97e-02 g/l,-1.14,-4.33,14,13,19,425.54999999999995,266.7724,107.34016791926672,"6-amino-2-{[(2S)-1-[(4R,7S,10S,13S,16S,19R)-19-amino-13-benzyl-10-(2-carbamoylethyl)-7-(carbamoylmethyl)-16-[(4-hydroxyphenyl)methyl]-6,9,12,15,18-pentaoxo-1,2-dithia-5,8,11,14,17-pentaazacycloicosane-4-carbonyl]pyrrolidin-2-yl]formamido}-N-(carbamoylmethyl)hexanamide",0,2,10.259818247509296,9.426739674150559,0,4,0,0,0,1,MDB00000731,

Tungsten is remarkable for its robustness, especially the fact that it has the highest melting point of all the elements discovered, melting at 3,422 °C. Tungsten-based products are used in a wide range of applications ranging from daily household necessities to highly specialized components of modern science and technology. Applications include including incandescent light bulb filaments, X-ray tubes (as both the filament and target), electrodes in gas tungsten arc welding, superalloys, and radiation shielding. Physiologically, tungsten exists in the body as an ion. Tungsten is the only metal from the third transition series (of the Periodic Table) that is known to occur in biomolecules (specifically in a few species of bacteria and archaea, but not eukaryotes). It is the heaviest element known to be essential to any living organism.  However, tungsten interferes with molybdenum and copper metabolism and is somewhat toxic.  Tungsten was originally believed to be relatively inert and an only slightly toxic metal, but beginning in the year 2000, the risk presented by tungsten alloys, its dusts and particulates to induce cancer such as acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and several other adverse effects in animals as well as humans has been highlighted from in vitro and in vivo experiments.",HMDB0001989,[W+4],W,1S/W/q+4,YFGRPIXHCIXTLM-UHFFFAOYSA-N,tungsten(4+) ion,0,,183.84,183.950932553,,,,0,0,0,0,0,1.7784,tungsten(4+) ion,4,4,,,1,0,1,0,1,0,MDB00000736,"5185,5225"
377,Eicosapentaenoic acid,"Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA or icosapentaenoic acid or timnodonic acid) is an important polyunsaturated fatty acid found in fish oils. Eicosapentaenoic acid is an omega-3 fatty acid. In physiological literature, EPA is given the name 20:5(n-3). Its systematic chemical name is all-cis-5,8,11,14,17-icosapentaenoic acid. Chemically, EPA is a carboxylic acid with a 20-carbon chain and five cis double bonds; the first double bond is located at the third carbon from the omega end. Because of the presence of double bonds, EPA is called a polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA). A diet rich in eicosapentaenoic acid lowers serum lipid concentration, reduces incidence of cardiovascular disorders, prevents platelet aggregation, and inhibits arachidonic acid conversion into the thromboxane-2 and prostaglandin-2 families. Metabolically EPA acts as a precursor for prostaglandin-3 (which inhibits platelet aggregation), thromboxane-3 and leukotriene-5 groups. It is found in fish oils of cod liver, herring, mackerel, salmon, menhaden and sardine.

Butyrylcarnitine is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and acidic. Butyrylcarnitine is elevated in patients with short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD) deficiency, in infants with acute acidosis and generalized muscle weakness, and in middle-aged patients with chronic myopathy localized in muscle (OMIM: 201470 ). Specifically, in infants (0-1 year old) with short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, butyrylcarnitine is elevated in the urine at a concentration of 0-8.966 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 7776094) compared to normal infants at a concentration of 0 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 7776094). Butyrylcarnitine is also associated with very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (vLCAD), a condition in which the body is unable to break down certain fats.

382,Fructosamine,"Fructosamine is a compound which can be considered as the result of a reaction between fructose and ammonia or an amine (with a molecule of water being released). A fructosamine is also formed when a carbonyl group of glucose reacts with an amino group of a protein, as the double bond to oxygen moves from the end carbon atom to the next carbon atom and water is released. Fructosamines formed from blood proteins such as serum albumin are known as Glycated Serum Protein (GSP) or Glycated Albumin, and are used to identify the plasma glucose concentration over time and so assess diabetic control (PMID: 24904879). Glucose molecules are joined to protein molecules to form stable ketoamines, or fructosamines, through glycation, a nonenzymatic mechanism involving a labile Schiff base intermediate and the Amadori rearrangement. The amount of fructosamine in serum is increased in diabetes mellitus owing to the abnormally high concentration of sugar in blood. The concentration of fructosamine in serum thus reflects the degree of glycemic control attained by the diabetic patient and is useful in monitoring the effectiveness of therapy in diabetes over a period of several weeks, in a manner analogous to the determination of glycated hemoglobin. Of the analytical approaches used to measure fructosamine, affinity chromatography with m-aminophenylboronic acid and the nitroblue tetrazolium reduction method appear to be the most practical means for clinical chemists to assay fructosamine quickly, economically, and accurately. Fructosamine values can readily distinguish normal individuals and diabetic patients in good glycemic control from diabetics in poor control. Unlike glycated hemoglobin, which reflects the average blood sugar concentration over the past six to eight weeks, fructosamine reflects the average blood sugar concentration over the past two to three weeks. Thus a clinical advantage is that fructosamine responds more quickly to changes in therapy, thereby allowing for improved glycemic control. Fructosamine is used in conjunction with determinations of blood sugar and (or) of glycated hemoglobin, or by itself, the fructosamine assay can provide clinically useful information for the detection and control of diabetes (PMID: 3319287). In individuals with diabetes mellitus, an increased level of serum fructosamine is associated with prolonged hyperglycemia for 2-3 weeks prior to testing (408 (346–653) uM) (PMID: 30641705). Fructosamine is found to be decreased in plasma of individuals with 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency, which is an inborn error of metabolism (192 (149-242) uM) (PMID: 17919531). In individuals with cirrhosis, fructosamine is significantly decreased in plasma compared to a normal individual (228 (180–255) uM) (PMID: 3319287). Elevated serum fructosamine levels are also strongly associated with kidney dysfunction in diabetic patients (315 (260–430) uM) (PMID: 30641705).",HMDB0002030,NC[C@@]1(O)OC[C@@H](O)[C@@H](O)[C@@H]1O,C6H13NO5,"1S/C6H13NO5/c7-2-6(11)5(10)4(9)3(8)1-12-6/h3-5,8-11H,1-2,7H2/t3-,4-,5+,6-/m1/s1",IXZISFNWUWKBOM-ARQDHWQXSA-N,"(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2-(aminomethyl)oxane-2,3,4,5-tetrol",-2.864881114666667,12.674780905499912,179.1711,179.079372531,9.90e+02 g/l,-2.71,0.74,6,5,1,116.17,38.018299999999996,16.43334832775998,"(2R,3S,4R,5R)-2-(aminomethyl)oxane-2,3,4,5-tetrol",0,1,8.166097195486996,10.705619047448298,1,1,1,0,0,0,MDB00000752,"5200,5288,5324,5355,5356"

Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) damage proteins, lipid membranes, and nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), all critical functional components of living cells. The progressive accumulation of unrepaired free radical damage over time is believed to be a major contributor to the aging process and to a variety of age-related chronic diseases. Generation of most free radicals is a 'side effect' of normal metabolic processes, especially mitochondrial production of ROS, including superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radical, coincident to oxidative metabolism. (PMID 14607529). 8-OHG (marker of oxidative damage to RNA) was found in the cerebral cortex in three of six cases of neuropathologically examined autopsy of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis patients.

386,Hyaluronic acid,"Hyaluronic acid (HA) also called hyaluronan is an anionic, nonsulfated glycosaminoglycan distributed widely throughout connective, epithelial, and neural tissues. It is a large polymer of disaccharide units of N-acetylglucosamine, and glucuronic acid glycosidically linked through their respective 1-4 ring positions with a typicaly weight of 3-4 million Da. It is the most abundant glycosaminoglycan (GAG) in mammalian tissue. It is present in high concentrations in connective tissue, such as skin, vitreous humor, cartilage, and umbilical cord, but the largest single reservoir is the synovial fluid (SF) of the diarthrodial joints, where concentrations of 0.5-4 mg/mL are achieved. Hyaluronic acid, is the major hydrodynamic nonprotein component of joint SF. Its unique viscoelastic properties confer remarkable shock absorbing and lubricating abilities to SF, while its enormous macromolecular size and hydrophilicity serve to retain fluid in the joint cavity during articulation. HA restricts the entry of large plasma proteins and cells into SF but facilitates solute exchange between the synovial capillaries and cartilage and other joint tissues. In addition, HA can form a pericellular coat around cells, interact with proinflammatory mediators, and bind to cell receptors, such as cluster determinant (CD)44 and receptor for hyaluronate-mediated motility (RHAMM), where it modulates cell proliferation, migration, and gene expression. All these physicochemical and biologic properties of HA have been shown to be molecular weight (MW) dependent. The diverse physicochemical properties of HA arise from its unique macromolecular structure. Within the joint cavity, HA molecules are predominately synthesized by the type B synovial cells.

N-Acetylputrescine is the most abundant of all polyamines both in normal individuals and in patients with leukemia (PMID 9464484). N-Acetylputrescine is the N-acetylated form of the naturally occurring polyamine called putrescine. The N-acetylation is mediated by the enzyme diamine N-acetyltransferase. Putrescine is related to cadaverine (another polyamine). Both are produced by the breakdown of amino acids in living and dead organisms and both are toxic in large doses. Putrescine and cadaverine are largely responsible for the foul odor of putrefying flesh, but also contribute to the odor of such processes as bad breath and bacterial vaginosis. Putrescine is also found in semen. Putrescine attacks S-adenosyl methionine and converts it to spermidine. Spermidine in turn attacks another s-adenosyl methionine and converts it to spermine. Putrescine is synthesized in small quantities by healthy living cells by the action of ornithine decarboxylase.↵",HMDB0002064,CC(=O)NCCCCN,C6H14N2O,"1S/C6H14N2O/c1-6(9)8-5-3-2-4-7/h2-5,7H2,1H3,(H,8,9)",KLZGKIDSEJWEDW-UHFFFAOYSA-N,N-(4-aminobutyl)acetamide,-1.0262736609999996,,130.1882,130.11061308,1.41e+02 g/l,-0.84,0.04,2,2,4,55.120000000000005,36.8224,15.281189132520048,acetylputrescine,0,1,9.904074103986346,16.482677381445836,1,0,1,0,0,0,MDB00000765,

Erucic acid occurs in nature only along with bitter-tasting compounds. Erucic acid has many of the same uses as mineral oils but with the advantage that it is more readily bio-degradable. Its high tolerance to temperature makes it suitable for transmission oil. Its ability to polymerize and dry means it can be - and is - used as a binder for oil paints. Increased levels of eicosenoic acid (20:ln9) and erucic acid (22:1n9) have been found in the red blood cell membranes of autistic subjects with developmental regression (PMID: 16581239). Erucic acid is broken down long-chain acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) dehydrogenase, which is produced in the liver.

391,27-Hydroxycholesterol,"27-hydroxycholesterol is an oxygenated derivative of cholesterol and a major oxysterol in circulation. 27-hydroxycholesterol is the product of the enzyme sterol 27-hydroxylase. The enzyme is critical for degradation of the steroid side-chain and a genetic deficiency of the enzyme leads to reduced formation of bile acids in humans. There is a correlation between 27-hydroxycholesterol and cholesterol in the circulation. Interestingly females have lower levels of 27-hydroxycholesterol than males. A strong correlation is observed between circulating levels of 27-hydroxycholesterol and cholesterol, in both healthy subjects and subjects with hypercholesterolemia and documented atherosclerosis. 27-hydroxycholesterol is metabolized by an oxysterol 7a-hydroxylase in the liver, and changes in the activity of this enzyme may lead to accumulation of 27-hydroxycholesterol in the circulation. It has been reported that patients with a genetic deficiency of oxysterol 7a-hydroxylase in the liver have markedly increased levels of 27-hydroxycholesterol in the circulation. Under normal conditions, however, and in the absence of liver or kidney disease, changes in the levels of 27-hydroxycholesterol in blood are likely to be caused by changes in the rate of synthesis of these steroids rather than by the rate of metabolism. Three possible explanations for the high concentrations of 27-hydroxycholesterol found in the circulation of individuals with atherosclerosis could be: 1) Increased expression of sterol 27-hydroxylase owing to a genetic factor or some other factor completely unrelated to atherosclerosis. 2) The extrahepatic sterol 27-hydroxylase may be up-regulated by circulating factors (e.g. cytokines) that are directly or indirectly related to the development of atherosclerosis. 3) The high amounts of cholesterol accumulating in macrophages in some patients with atherosclerosis may result in increased flux of 27-hydroxycholesterol from the macrophages to the circulation.' - Since there is a close relation between levels of cholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol in the circulation, the possibility must be considered that the flux of 27-hydroxycholesterol into the brain may be part of the yet unexplained link between hypercholesterolemia and Alzheimer's disease. 27-hydroxysterol is the most dominant oxysterol in human ateromas where it may reflect a mechanism for eliminating excessive cholesterol and thus have a protective role. Hypercholesterolemia and chronic low-grade immunological activation are pivotal in the development of atherosclerosis. However, the interconnections between these two factors are not well known.

393,Coproporphyrinogen I,"Coproporphyrinogen I is a porphyrin metabolite arising from heme synthesis. Porphyrins are pigments found in both animal and plant life. Coproporphyrinogen I is a tetrapyrrole dead-end product resulting from the spontaneous oxidation of the methylene bridges of coproporphyrinogen arising from heme synthesis. It is secreted in feces and urine. Coproporphyrinogen I is biosynthesized from the tetrapyrrole hydroxymethylbilane, which is converted by the action of uroporphyrinogen synthase to uroporphyrinogen I. Uroporphyrinogen I is subsequently converted into coproporphyrinogen I through a series of four decarboxylations. Increased levels of coproporphyrinogens can indicate congenital erythropoietic porphyria or sideroblastic anemia, which are inherited disorders. Porphyria is a pathological state characterized by abnormalities of porphyrin metabolism and results in the excretion of large quantities of porphyrins in the urine and in extreme sensitivity to light. A large number of factors are capable of increasing porphyrin excretion, owing to different and multiple causes and etiologies: (1) the main site of the chronic hepatic porphyria disease process concentrates on the liver, (2) a functional and morphologic liver injury is almost regularly associated with this chronic porphyria, and (3) the toxic form due to occupational and environmental exposure takes mainly a subclinical course. Hepatic factors include disturbance in coproporphyrinogen metabolism, which results from inhibition of coproporphyrinogen oxidase as well as from the rapid loss and diminished utilization of coproporphyrinogen in the hepatocytes. This may also explain why coproporphyrin, its autoxidation product, predominates physiologically in the urine. Decreased biliary excretion of coproporphyrin leading to a compensatory urinary excretion. Therefore, the coproporphyrin ring isomer ratio becomes a sensitive index for impaired liver function, intrahepatic cholestasis, and disturbed activity of hepatic uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase. In itself, secondary coproporphyrinuria is not associated with porphyria symptoms of a hepatologic-gastroenterologic, neurologic, or dermatologic order, even though coproporphyrinuria can occur with such symptoms (PMID: 3327428 ). Under certain conditions, coproporphyrinogen I can act as a phototoxin, a neurotoxin, and a metabotoxin. A phototoxin leads to cell damage upon exposure to light. A neurotoxin causes damage to nerve cells and nerve tissues. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of porphyrins are associated with porphyrias such as porphyria variegate, acute intermittent porphyria, hereditary coproporphyria (HCP), congenital erythropoietic porphyria, and sideroblastic anemia. There are several types of porphyrias (most are inherited). Hepatic porphyrias are characterized by acute neurological attacks (seizures, psychosis, extreme back and abdominal pain, and an acute polyneuropathy), while the erythropoietic forms present with skin problems (usually a light-sensitive blistering rash and increased hair growth). The neurotoxicity of porphyrins may be due to their selective interactions with tubulin, which disrupt microtubule formation and cause neural malformations (PMID: 3441503 ).",HMDB0002158,CC1=C2CC3=C(CCC(O)=O)C(C)=C(CC4=C(CCC(O)=O)C(C)=C(CC5=C(CCC(O)=O)C(C)=C(CC(N2)=C1CCC(O)=O)N5)N4)N3,C36H44N4O8,"1S/C36H44N4O8/c1-17-21(5-9-33(41)42)29-14-26-19(3)23(7-11-35(45)46)31(39-26)16-28-20(4)24(8-12-36(47)48)32(40-28)15-27-18(2)22(6-10-34(43)44)30(38-27)13-25(17)37-29/h37-40H,5-16H2,1-4H3,(H,41,42)(H,43,44)(H,45,46)(H,47,48)",WIUGGJKHYQIGNH-UHFFFAOYSA-N,"3-[9,14,19-tris(2-carboxyethyl)-5,10,15,20-tetramethyl-21,22,23,24-tetraazapentacyclo[16.2.1.1³,⁶.1⁸,¹¹.1¹³,¹⁶]tetracosa-1(20),3,5,8,10,13,15,18-octaen-4-yl]propanoic acid",4.891239218666666,4.27210608452491,660.7566,660.315914404,1.11e-02 g/l,1.97,-4.77,8,8,12,212.35999999999996,181.86080000000004,71.34460230867256,coproporphyrinogen I,0,-4,,3.845633608717185,0,5,0,0,0,1,MDB00000785,5198

395,Cobalamin,"Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) is one of 8 B vitamins. It is the largest and most structurally complex vitamin. exists in four near-identical chemical forms (vitamers): cyanocobalamin, hydroxocobalamin, adenosylcobalamin and methylcobalamin. All forms of vitamin B12 contain the biochemically rare element cobalt (chemical symbol Co) positioned in the center of a corrin ring. The only organisms to produce vitamin B12 are certain bacteria, and archaea. Cobalamin is a coenzyme essential for various metabolic functions, including fat and carbohydrate metabolism and protein synthesis. It plays an important role in hematopoiesis and maintaining the integrity of the neural system. Cobalamin participates in two enzymatic processes in mammalian cells. In the methionine synthase (EC 2.1.1.13) reaction, homocysteine (HCys) is converted to methionine allowing for the ""recycling"" of 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate (THF) to N5,10 methylene-THF which is needed for the de novo synthesis of thymidylic acid and ultimately, for DNA formation. Since conversion of N5,10-methylene-THF to N5-methyl-THF is irreversible, cobalamin deficiency ""traps"" folic acid as N5-methyl-THF. Concurrently, HCys accumulates while methionine decreases, leading to a decrease in S-adenosylmethionine which further limits N5,10-methylene-THF formation by decreasing the synthesis of formyl-THF (""formate starvation""). Decreased methionine and S-adenosylmethionine may limit many methylation reactions including those involving DNA and myelin basic protein. In the methylmalonyl CoA mutase (EC 5.1.99.1) reaction, methylmalonyl CoA, derived from propionic acid synthesized by intestinal bacteria, is converted to succinyl CoA, a precursor for fatty acid and heme synthesis Thus, cobalamin deficiency results in methylmalonic acid (MMA) accumulation. Cobalamin deficiency causes megaloblastic anemia and neurocognitive abnormalities but effects on immune function and bone formation have also been described. Low serum cobalamin levels increase the risk of osteoporosis. Tests for cobalamin deficiency include measurements of 1) total cobalamin; 2) MMA and HCys, as indices of functional cobalamin deficiency; and 3) holotranscobalamin as a measure of the metabolically active fraction of circulating cobalamin. Each approach has significant limitations. Moreover, since the pathogenesis of neurologic dysfunction in cobalamin deficiency remains unclear, these tests may not be reliable markers of neurocognitive impairment. Subtle cobalamin deficiency, defined as elevated metabolite levels usually in asymptomatic patients with low or normal serum cobalamin values, is prevalent in the elderly and has been associated with food cobalamin malabsorption, a disorder characterized by the inability to release vitamin B12 from food or from its binding proteins. Malabsorption is often unrecognized or not investigated. However, because of the potential seriousness of the complications, particularly neuropsychiatric and hematological investigation of all patients who present with vitamin or nutritional deficiency is required. Classic disorders, such as pernicious anemia, are the cause of cobalamin deficiency in only a limited proportion of elderly patients. Epidemiological studies have shown a prevalence of cobalamin deficiency of around 20% in the elderly population of industrialized countries (between 50% and 60%, depending on the definition of cobalamin deficiency used in the study). New routes of cobalamin administration (oral and nasal) are currently being developed, especially the use of oral cobalamin therapy to treat food-cobalamin malabsorption.

398,Equol,"Equol is a metabolite of daidzein, a phytoestrogen common in the human diet and abundant in soy. Intestinal bacteria in humans can reduce daidzein to equol. Equol can be found in normal human urine. The clinical effectiveness of soy isoflavones may be a function of the ability to biotransform soy isoflavones to the more potent estrogenic metabolite, equol, which may enhance the actions of soy isoflavones, owing to its greater affinity for estrogen receptors, unique antiandrogenic properties, and superior antioxidant activity. However, not all individuals consuming daidzein produce equol. Only approximately one-third to one-half of the population is able to metabolize daidzein to equol. This high variability in equol production is presumably attributable to interindividual differences in the composition of the intestinal microflora, which may play an important role in the mechanisms of action of isoflavones.

399,Picolinic acid,"Picolinic acid is a metabolite of the tryptophan catabolism. Picolinic acid is produced under inflammatory conditions and a co-stimulus with interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) of macrophage (Mphi) effector functions, is a selective inducer of the Mphi inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha) and -1beta (MIPs), two chemokines/cytokines involved in the elicitation of the inflammatory reactions and in the development of the Th1 responses. IFNgamma and picolinic acid have reciprocal effects on the production of MIPs chemokines and the expression of their receptor. The concerted action of IFNgamma and picolinic acid on MIP-1alpha/beta chemokine/receptor system is likely to be of pathophysiological significance and to represent an important regulatory mechanism for leukocyte recruitment and distribution into damaged tissues during inflammatory responses. Picolinic acid has an effect on the production of L-arginine-derived reactive nitrogen intermediates in macrophages, by augmenting IFN-gamma-induced NO2- production, and acts synergistically with IFN-gamma in activating macrophages. Children with acrodermatitis enteropathica (AE) are treated with oral zinc dipicolinate (zinc-PA). The concentration of picolinic acid in the plasma of asymptomatic children with AE was significantly less than that of normal children. However, oral treatment with PA alone is ineffective. The results support the hypothesis that the genetic defect in AE is in the tryptophan pathway, although the role of PA in zinc metabolism remains to be defined.

401,Oxalic acid,"Oxalic acid is a strong dicarboxylic acid occurring in many plants and vegetables. It is produced in the body by metabolism of glyoxylic acid or ascorbic acid. It is not metabolized but excreted in the urine. It is used as an analytical reagent and general reducing agent (Pubchem). Oxalic acid (IUPAC name: ethanedioic acid, formula H2C2O4) is a dicarboxylic acid with structure (HOOC)-(COOH). Because of the joining of two carboxyl groups, this is one of the strongest organic acids. It is also a reducing agent. The anions of oxalic acid as well as its salts and esters are known as oxalates (Wikipedia ). Bodily oxalic acid may also be synthesized via the metabolism of either glyoxylic acid or unused ascorbic acid (vitamin C), which is a serious health consideration for long term megadosers of vitamin C supplements. 80% of kidney stones are formed from calcium oxalate. Some Aspergillus species produce oxalic acid, which reacts with blood or tissue calcium to precipitate calcium oxalate. There is some preliminary evidence that the administration of probiotics can affect oxalic acid excretion rates (and presumably oxalic acid levels as well) (Wikipedia ). Oxalic acid is found to be associated with fumarase deficiency and primary hyperoxaluria I, which are inborn errors of metabolism. In infants (0-1 year) with fumarase deficiency, oxalic acid is elevated in the urine at a concentration of 84.134 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 26078636) compared to normal infants at a concentration of <50.229 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 26078636). SImilarly, in adults (>18 years old) with primary hyperoxaluria I, oxalic acid in the urine is elevated at a concentration of 651.333 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 705974) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 7.7-10 μmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 27012787). Oxalic acid is a marker for yeast overgrowth from Aspergillus, Penicillum and/or Candida. Can also be elevated due to exposures from vitamin C or ethylene glycol poisoning. Oxalate is elevated in the urine of children with autism. (PMID: 21911305 ). Oxalic acid has also been identified as a uremic toxin according to the European Uremic Toxin Working Group (PMID: 22626821 , PMID: 21359215). Thus, oxalic acid is associated with uremia and this is seen in adults (>18 years old) with uremia where oxalic acid concentrations are elevated at a concentration of 43.32 +/- 6.66 μM (PMID: 2026685) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 3.33 +/- 1.11 μM (PMID: 22626821 , PMID: 21359215).",HMDB0002329,OC(=O)C(O)=O,C2H2O4,"1S/C2H2O4/c3-1(4)2(5)6/h(H,3,4)(H,5,6)",MUBZPKHOEPUJKR-UHFFFAOYSA-N,oxalic acid,-0.2637515693333333,4.110222978861222,90.0349,89.995308552,6.57e+01 g/l,-0.51,-0.14,4,2,1,74.6,14.4386,6.229225106776085,oxalic acid,0,-2,,1.3639908147001307,1,0,1,0,0,0,MDB00000825,"5244,5302,5327,5343,5423"

There are three isomeric forms of muconic acid, designated as trans,trans-muconic acid, cis,trans-muconic acid, and cis,cis-muconic acid which differ by the geometry around the double bonds. trans,trans-Muconic is a urinary metabolite of benzene and has been used as a biomarker of exposure to benzene in humans exposed to levels as low as 1 ppm. However, muconic acid may also be derived from sorbic acid and its salts. Dietary supplementation with 500 mg sorbic acid significantly increases the urinary trans,trans-Muconic acid excretion. Under study conditions 0.12% of the sorbic acid dose is excreted in urine as trans, trans muconic acid thereby indicating that a typical dietary intake of 6 - 30 mg/day of sorbic acid accounts for 10 -50% of the background of trans, trans muconic acid excretion in nonsmokers, and for 5 - 25% in smokers.

403,Hexacosanoic acid,"Hexacosanoic acid, or cerotic acid, is a 26-carbon long-chain saturated fatty acid with the chemical formula CH3(CH2)24COOH. It is most commonly found in beeswax and carnauba wax, and is a white crystalline solid. Cerotic acid is also a type of very long chain fatty acid that is often associated with the disease adrenoleukodystrophy, which involves the excessive saturation of unmetabolized fatty acid chains, including cerotic acid, in the peroxisome. Hexacosanoic acid, also known as C26:0 or N-hexacosanoate, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as very long-chain fatty acids. These are fatty acids with an aliphatic tail that contains at least 22 carbon atoms. Hexacosanoic acid is a very hydrophobic molecule, practically insoluble in water, and relatively neutral. Hexacosanoic acid is a potentially toxic compound. X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is a peroxisomal disorder biochemically characterized by the accumulation of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA), particularly hexacosanoic acid (C(26:0)) and tetracosanoic acid (C(24:0)), in tissues and biological fluids. (PMID 16750542). Hexacosanoic acid is associated with adrenomyeloneuropathy, an inherited condition that affects the spinal cord. It is a form of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. On average, people with AMN begin to develop features in the late twenties. In adults (>18 years old) with adrenomyeloneuropathy, hexacosanoic acid is elevated in the blood at a concentration of 4.10 (2.42 - 6.43) μM (PMID: 2294415) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 0.83 +/- 0.45 μM (PMID: 2294415). Hexacosanoic acid is also associated with adrenoleukodystrophy, a genetic condition that damages the membrane (myelin sheath) that covers nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. In children (1--13 years old) with pseudonatal adrenoleukodystrophy, hexacosanoic acid is elevated in the blood at a concentration of 7.167 μM (PMID: 2894756) compared to normal children at a concentration of 0.832 +/- 0.454 μM (PMID: 2894756). Hexacosanoic acid is also associated with D-bifunctional protein deficiency, a disorder that causes deterioration of nervous system functions (neurodegeneration) beginning in infancy. Newborns with D-bifunctional protein deficiency have weak muscle tone (hypotonia) and seizures. Most babies with this condition never acquire any developmental skills. In infants (0-1 year old), hexacosanoic acid is elevated in the blood at a concentration of 5.4 μM (PMID: 12646728) compared to normal infants at a concentration of 0.45-1.32 μM (PMID: 12646728).",HMDB0002356,CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC(O)=O,C26H52O2,"1S/C26H52O2/c1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-11-12-13-14-15-16-17-18-19-20-21-22-23-24-25-26(27)28/h2-25H2,1H3,(H,27,28)",XMHIUKTWLZUKEX-UHFFFAOYSA-N,hexacosanoic acid,10.702269427666668,,396.6899,396.396730908,1.81e-05 g/l,9.87,-7.34,2,1,24,37.3,123.09359999999998,55.83465806631858,hexacosanoic acid,0,-1,,4.952019655228562,0,0,0,0,0,0,MDB00000829,"5248,5252,5325,5334,5424,5540,5554"
404,Nervonic acid,"Nervonic acid (24:1, n−9) is also known as selacholeic acid and cis-15-tetracosenoic acid. It is a long chain unsaturated fatty acid consisting of 24 carbons. It is enriched in sphingomyelin and is particularly abundant in the white matter of animal brains and in peripheral nervous tissue where nervonyl sphingolipids are enriched in the myelin sheath of nerve fibers.  Nervonic acid is an essential nutrient for the growth and maintenance of the brain. It has been found in breast-milk and is believed to speed the development in infants. Nervonic acid is a regulator of the Ca2+ ion channel in the cell membrane of nerve tissues, so nervonic acid plays an important role in the control of the levels of calcium of the cytosol. Research shows that there is negative relationship between nervonic acid and obesity-related risk factors (PMID: 16394593). Demyelination in adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is associated with an accumulation of very long chain saturated fatty acids stemming from a genetic defect in the peroxisomal beta oxidation system responsible for the chain shortening of these fatty acids. Sphingolipids from post mortem ALD brain have decreased levels of nervonic acid, 24:1(n-9), and increased levels of stearic acid, 18:0.

406,3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-3-hydroxypropanoic acid,"3-(3-Hydroxyphenyl)-3-hydroxypropanoic acid (HPHPA) is an organic acid detected in human urine. It is relatively abundant in adult human urine and it is normally relatively benign. It is thought that the presence of this acid is from nutritional sources (i.e. dietary phenylalanine or polyphenols). However, there has been a considerable degree of ambiguity in the origin and/or significance of this compound (PMID: 11978597 ). Recently, it has been reported that HPHPA is actually an abnormal phenylalanine metabolite arising from bacterial metabolism in the gastrointestinal tract. Specifically, HPHPA appears to arise from the action of the anaerobic bacteria Clostridia sp. (PMID: 20423563 ; PMID: 24063620 ). Elevated levels of HPHPA have been reported in the urine of children with autism as well as in adult patients with schizophrenia. It has been proposed that HPHPA may be a bacterial metabolite of m-tyrosine, a tyrosine analog that causes symptoms of autism in experimental animals. Under certain conditions, HPHPA can act as a neurotoxin and a metabotoxin. A neurotoxin causes damage to nerve cells and nerve tissues. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of HPHPA are associated with autism and schizophrenia. The mechanism by which HPHPA exerts its toxic effects is not clear. It may function as a catecholamine analog and disrupt catecholamine signalling, especially in younger individuals. Alternately, HPHPA may function as an amino acid analog to tyrosine and phenylalanine. High plasma concentrations of phenylalanine (and possibly HPHPA) are known to influence the blood-brain barrier transport of large neutral amino acids. This altered transport is believed to interfere with the function of different cerebral enzyme systems in the developing brain. Studies have shown that higher levels of HPHPA are associated with overgrowth of Clostridia in the gut, including Clostridium difficile, Clostridium sporogenes, Clostridium botulinum, Clostridium calortolerans, Clostridium mangenoyi, Clostridium ghoni, Clostridium bifermentans, Clostridium sordelli.

407,"1,5-Anhydrosorbitol","1,5-Anhydrosorbitol, also known as 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) is a polyol or sugar alcohol with a structure in which the first-position hydroxyl of glucose is reduced. It is contained in a wide variety of foods and is hardly metabolized in the body. It is a validated marker of short-term glycemic control. 1,5-Anhydrosorbitol is derived mainly from food and is found in nearly all foods. It is well absorbed in the intestine, and is distributed to all organs and tissues. It is metabolically stable, being excreted in the urine when its level exceeds the renal threshold. 1,5-Anhydrosorbitol is reabsorbed in the renal tubules, and is competitively inhibited by glucosuria, which leads to a reduction in its level in serum. The correlation between this reduction and the amount of glucose present in urine is so close that 1,5 AG can be used as a sensitive, day-to-day, real-time marker of glycemic control. 1,5-Anhydrosorbitol provides useful information on current glycemic control and is superior to both hemoglobin A1C and fructosamine in detecting near-normoglycemia. 1,5-AG in human plasma has been proposed for several years as a short-term, retrospective marker of glycemic control and seems to be the most suitable parameter for monitoring glucose excursions. The decrease in serum 1,5-AG is very sensitive to urinary glucose excretion. It is a metabolically inert polyol that competes with glucose for reabsorption in the kidneys. Otherwise stable levels of 1,5-AG are rapidly depleted as blood glucose levels exceed the renal threshold for glucosuria. 1,5-AG is also more tightly associated with glucose fluctuations and postprandial glucose.

408,Desmosterol,"Desmosterol is a cholesterol-like compound that is an intermediate in the synthesis of cholesterol. More specifically, desmosterol is the immediate precursor of cholesterol in the Bloch pathway of cholesterol biosynthesis. 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase catalyses the reduction of desmosterol to cholesterol. Desmosterolosis is a rare autosomal recessive inborn errors of cholesterol synthesis that is caused by defective activity of desmosterol reductase (also known as 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase) which results in an accumulation of desmosterol (DHCR24, EC 1.3.1.72). Symptoms include severe osteosclerotic skeletal dysplasia, 2-3 toe syndactyly and Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS). The biochemical block in SLOS results in decreased cholesterol levels and increased 7-dehydrocholesterol levels.

412,Zeaxanthin,"Zeaxanthin is a carotenoid xanthophyll and is one of the most common carotenoids found in nature. It is the pigment that gives corn, saffron, and many other plants their characteristic color. Zeaxanthin breaks down to form picrocrocin and safranal, which are responsible for the taste and aroma of saffron. Carotenoids are among the most common pigments in nature and are natural lipid soluble antioxidants. Zeaxanthin is one of the two carotenoids (the other is lutein) that accumulate in the eye lens and macular region of the retina with concentrations in the macula greater than those found in plasma and other tissues. Lutein and zeaxanthin have identical chemical formulas and are isomers, but they are not stereoisomers. The main difference between them is in the location of a double bond in one of the end rings. This difference gives lutein three chiral centers whereas zeaxanthin has two. A relationship between macular pigment optical density, a marker of lutein and zeaxanthin concentration in the macula, and lens optical density, an antecedent of cataractous changes, has been suggested. The xanthophylls may act to protect the eye from ultraviolet phototoxicity via quenching reactive oxygen species and/or other mechanisms. Some observational studies have shown that generous intakes of lutein and zeaxanthin, particularly from certain xanthophyll-rich foods like spinach, broccoli and eggs, are associated with a significant reduction in the risk for cataract (up to 20%) and for age-related macular degeneration (up to 40%). While the pathophysiology of cataract and age-related macular degeneration is complex and contains both environmental and genetic components, research studies suggest dietary factors including antioxidant vitamins and xanthophylls may contribute to a reduction in the risk of these degenerative eye diseases. Further research is necessary to confirm these observations.

413,Methylimidazoleacetic acid,"Methylimidazoleacetic acid is a methylated derivative of imidazoleacetic acid. It is the main metabolite of histamine. This end product of histamine catabolism is formed by N-methylation in the imidazole ring to methylhistamine by histamine methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.8) and a subsequent oxidative deamination in the side chain by type B monoamine oxidase (EC 1.4.3.4). From studies is known that as much as 70 to 80 percent of the histamine metabolized in the body is excreted in the urine as Methylimidazoleacetic acid. Thus, urinary Methylimidazoleacetic acid being the major and specific histamine metabolite is a clear marker of any changes in histamine metabolism in the body. The urinary excretion of methylimidazoleacetic acid is considered a reliable indicator of histamine turnover rate in the body. The excretion of Methylimidazoleacetic acid is higher in men than women however; this gender difference is abolished when corrected for creatinine excretion. A possible explanation for the difference in excretion rates is that basal histamine turnover is related to body size. There is no significant difference in Methylimidazoleacetic acid excretion between smokers and non-smokers when analysing absolute values (mg/24 h). When using Methylimidazoleacetic acid values corrected for creatinine excretion female smokers have significantly higher Methylimidazoleacetic acid excretion compared to non-smokers.

414,Theobromine,"Theobromine, also called 3,7-Dimethylxanthine or xantheose is a bitter alkaloid found in Theobroma cacao (the cacao bean) and other plants such as tea leaves and the kola nut. It is one the main alkaloids found in chocolate. Theobromine is part of the methylxanthine family, which also includes the similar compounds theophylline and caffeine. Despite its name, the compound contains no bromine. Theobromine can be used as a bronchodilator and as a vasodilator. It has a weaker diuretic activity than theophylline and is a less powerful stimulant of smooth muscle. It has practically no stimulant effect on the central nervous system. Theobromine was formerly used as a diuretic and in the treatment of angina pectoris and hypertension. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, pp1318-9). The presence of theobromine in chocolate is one of the causes for chocolate's mood-elevating effects. The amount of theobromine found in chocolate is small enough that chocolate can be safely consumed by humans in large quantities, but animals that metabolize theobromine more slowly, such as cats and dogs, can easily consume enough chocolate to cause chocolate poisoning. Theobromine is a stimulant frequently confused with caffeine. Theobromine has very different effects on the human body from caffeine; it is a mild, lasting stimulant with a mood improving effect, whereas caffeine has a strong, immediate effect and increases stress. There is a possible association between prostate cancer and theobromine. Theobromine is a contributing factor in acid reflux because it relaxes the esophageal sphincter muscle, allowing stomach acid access to the esophagus. -- Wikipedia",HMDB0002825,CN1C=NC2=C1C(=O)NC(=O)N2C,C7H8N4O2,"1S/C7H8N4O2/c1-10-3-8-5-4(10)6(12)9-7(13)11(5)2/h3H,1-2H3,(H,9,12,13)",YAPQBXQYLJRXSA-UHFFFAOYSA-N,"3,7-dimethyl-2,3,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-purine-2,6-dione",-0.7693216573333334,,180.164,180.06472552,7.76e+00 g/l,-0.78,-1.37,3,1,0,67.23,44.9345,16.84759944556188,theobromine,0,0,-0.9071824149877291,9.28030481882757,1,2,1,0,0,0,MDB00000881,5307
415,Oxytocin,"Oxytocin is a peptide consisting of 9 amino acids with the sequence CYIQNCPLG. It is a mammalian hormone that also acts as a neurotransmitter in the brain. The structure of oxytocin is very similar to that of vasopressin. Oxytocin and vasopressin are the only known hormones released by the human posterior pituitary gland to act at a distance. In women, it is released mainly after distention of the cervix and vagina during labor, and after stimulation of the nipples, facilitating birth and breastfeeding, respectively. Oxytocin is released during orgasm in both sexes. In the brain, oxytocin is involved in social recognition and bonding, and might be involved in the formation of trust between people. In the pituitary gland, oxytocin is packaged in large, dense-core vesicles, where it is bound to neurophysin as shown in the inset of the figure; neurophysin is a large peptide fragment of the giant precursor protein molecule from which oxytocin is derived by enzymatic cleavage. One international unit (IU) of oxytocin is the equivalent of about 2 micrograms of pure peptide. The actions of oxytocin are mediated by specific, high affinity oxytocin receptors. The oxytocin receptor is a G-protein-coupled receptor which requires Mg2+ and cholesterol. It belongs to the rhodopsin-type (class I) group of G-protein-coupled receptors. Synthetic oxytocin is sold as medication under the trade names Pitocin and Syntocinon and also as generic oxytocin. Injected oxytocin analogues are used to induce labour and support labour in case of non-progression of parturition.

416,6-Keto-prostaglandin F1a,"6-keto-Prostaglandin F1a, also known as 6-keto PGF1a or 6-keto PGF1alpha, is the inactive, non-enzymatic hydrolysis product of PGI2 (prostacyclin). Prostacyclin is a prostaglandin member of the eicosanoid family of lipid molecules. It inhibits platelet activation and is also an effective vasodilator. Prostaglandins are eicosanoids. The eicosanoids consist of the prostaglandins (PGs), thromboxanes (TXs), leukotrienes (LTs) and lipoxins (LXs). The PGs and TXs are collectively identified as prostanoids. Prostaglandins were originally shown to be synthesized in the prostate gland, thromboxanes from platelets (thrombocytes) and leukotrienes from leukocytes, hence the derivation of their names. All mammalian cells except erythrocytes synthesize eicosanoids. These molecules are extremely potent, able to cause profound physiological effects at very dilute concentrations. All eicosanoids function locally at the site of synthesis, through receptor-mediated G-protein linked signaling pathways. 1,2 6-keto PGF1a serves as a useful marker of PGI2 (prostacyclin) biosynthesis in vivo. A delayed and prolonged increase in 6-keto-PGF1 alpha is reported in animals with septic shock, i.e., those with fecal peritonitis or cecal ligation. 6-keto-Prostaglandin F1a plasma levels has been found increased in patients with epidemic hemorrhagic fever, in patients with acute obstructive suppurative cholangitis, in patients with gynecologic cancer and has significant correlation with the level of high density lipoprotein cholesterol in plasma.

417,D-Xylitol,"Xylitol is a five-carbon sugar alcohol. Xylitol is found naturally in many fruits (strawberries, plums, raspberries) and vegetables (cauliflower). Humans typically processes 15 grams of xylitol per day through food consumption. Xylitol can also be produced industrially starting from plant material rich in xylan which is hydrolized to obtain xylose. Xylitiol is extracted from hemicelluloses present in the corn raids, the almond hulls or the barks of birch (or of the by-products of wood: shavings hard, paper pulp). Of all polyols, xylitol is the one that has the sweetest flavor (it borders that of saccharose). It gives has a strong refreshing taste, which makes xylitol an ingredient of choice for the industry of sugar-free chewing gums. In addition to its use in confectionery, xylitol is used in the pharmaceutical industry, in toothpastes, in cosmetic (creams, soaps, etc.). Xylitol is produced starting from xylose, the isomaltose, by enzymatic transposition of the saccharose (sugar). Xylitol is not metabolized by cariogenic bacteria and gum chewing stimulates the flow of saliva; as a result, chewing xylitol gum may prevent dental caries. Chewing xylitol gum for 4 to 14 days reduces the amount of dental plaque. The reduction in the amount of plaque following xylitol gum chewing within 2 weeks may be a transient phenomenon. Chewing xylitol gum for 6 months reduced mutans streptococci levels in saliva and plaque in adults.

418,Erythritol,"Erythritol is a sugar alcohol or polyol that occurs widely in nature and has been found to occur naturally in several foods including wine, sake, beer, watermelon, pear, grapes and soy sauce. Erythritol is also used as a food additive and a sugar substitute.  Erythritol is 60–70% as sweet as sucrose (table sugar), yet it is almost noncaloric. It does not affect blood sugar or cause tooth decay. Evidence indicates that erythritol also exists endogenously in the tissues and body fluids of humans and animals. Erythritol is absorbed from the proximal intestine by passive diffusion in a manner similar to that of many low molecular weight organic molecules which do not have associated active transport systems, the rate of absorption being related to their molecular size; erythritol, a 4-carbon molecule, passes through the intestinal membranes at a faster rate than larger molecules such as mannitol or glucose. In diabetics, erythritol also has been shown to be rapidly absorbed and excreted unchanged in the urine.

419,Lycopene,"Lycopene is a bright red carotenoid pigment, a phytochemical found in tomatoes and other red fruits such as watermelons, grapefruits and papayas. In plants, algae, and other photosynthetic organisms, lycopene is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of many carotenoids, including beta-carotene, which is responsible for yellow, orange, or red pigmentation, Like all carotenoids, lycopene is a tetraterpene, assembled from 8 isoprene units. Lycopene is the most common carotenoid in the human body and is one of the most potent carotenoid antioxidants. Its name is derived from the tomato species classification, Solanum lycopersicum. Lycopene is the most powerful carotenoid quencher of singlet oxygen..

421,1-Methyluric acid,"1-Methyluric acid is one of the three main theophylline metabolites in man. 1-Methyluric acid is also one of the purine components found in urinary calculi. Methylated purines originate from the metabolism of methylxanthines (caffeine, theophylline and theobromine). Methyluric acids are indistinguishable from uric acid by simple methods routinely used in clinical laboratories, requiring the use of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Purine derivatives in urinary calculi could be considered markers of abnormal purine metabolism. The content of a purine derivative in stone depends on its average urinary excretion in the general population, similarity to the chemical structure of uric acid, and content of the latter in stone. This suggests that purines in stones represent a solid solution with uric acid as solvent. It is also plausible that methylxanthines, ubiquitous components of the diet and drugs, are involved in the pathogenesis of urolithiasis. Caffeine is metabolized via successive pathways mainly catalyzed by CYP1A2, xanthine oxidase or N-acetyltransferase-2 to give 14 different metabolites including 1-methyluric acid.

422,Hydrogen peroxide,"Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a very pale blue liquid which appears colourless in a dilute solution. It is slightly more viscous than water and is considered a weak acid. It has strong oxidizing properties and is therefore a powerful bleaching agent that is mostly used for bleaching paper, but has also found use as a disinfectant and as an oxidizer. Hydrogen peroxide in the form of carbamide peroxide is widely used for tooth whitening (bleaching), both in professionally- and in self-administered products. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a well-documented component of living cells. It plays important roles in host defense and oxidative biosynthetic reactions. In addition there is growing evidence that at low levels, H2O2 also functions as a signaling agent, particularly in higher organisms. H2O2 has increasingly been viewed as an important cellular signaling agent in its own right, capable of modulating both contractile and growth-promoting pathways with more far-reaching effects. Due to the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide in the skin of patients with the depigmentation disorder vitiligo, the human epidermis cannot have the normal capacity for autocrine synthesis, transport and degradation of acetylcholine as well as the muscarinic (m1-m5) and nicotinic signal transduction in keratinocytes and melanocytes. Accumulating evidence suggests that hydrogen peroxide H2O2 plays an important role in cancer development. Experimental data have shown that cancer cells produce high amounts of H2O2. An increase in the cellular levels of H2O2 has been linked to several key alterations in cancer, including DNA alterations, cell proliferation, apoptosis resistance, metastasis, angiogenesis and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) activation.

424,Guanidinosuccinic acid,"Guanidinosuccinic acid (GSA) is a guanidinylated derivative of succinic acid derived from the amino acid arginine. Guanidinosuccinic acid is a uremic toxin according to the European Uremic Toxin Working Group (PMID: 22626821). Levels of GSA are significantly increased in blood, cerebrospinal fluid and urine in patients with uremia or kidney failure. GSA was one of the earliest uremic toxins to be isolated and to have its toxicity identified. Guanidinosuccinic acid arises from the oxidation of argininosuccinic acid (ASA) by free radicals. Arginisuccinic acid is synthesized via the enzyme argininosuccinate synthetase and normally metabolized via argininosuccinate lyase. It has been noted that concentrations of GSA in both serum and urine decline sharply in animals and humans exposed to the essential amino acid, methionine. Even in healthy subjects intake of choline together with methionine is insufficient to satisfy total metabolic requirements for methyl groups. In end-stage renal disease, therefore, protein restriction contributes to the build-up of toxins in uremia. Replacement using specific amino acid mixtures should be directed toward identified deficiencies and adequacy monitored by following serum levels of the related toxins, in this case GSA and homocysteine.

425,Genistein,"Genistein is one of several known isoflavones commonly found in legumes. Isoflavones compounds, such as genistein and daidzein, are found in a number of plants, but soybeans and soy products like tofu and textured vegetable protein are the primary food source. Genistein is a natural bioactive compound derived from legumes and has drawn interest because of its potentially beneficial effects on some human degenerative diseases. It has a weak estrogenic effect and is a well-known non-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor at pharmacological doses. Epidemiological studies show that genistein intake is inversely associated with the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Data suggests a protective role of genistein in cardiovascular events. However, the mechanisms of the genistein action on vascular protective effects are unclear. Past extensive studies exploring its hypolipidemic effect resulted in contradictory data. Genistein also is a relatively poor antioxidant. However, genistein protects against pro-inflammatory factor-induced vascular endothelial barrier dysfunction and inhibits leukocyte-endothelium interaction, thereby modulating vascular inflammation, a major event in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Genistein exerts a non-genomic action by targeting on important signaling molecules in vascular endothelial cells (ECs). Genistein rapidly activates endothelial nitric oxide synthase and production of nitric oxide in ECs. This genistein effect is novel since it is independent of its known effects, but mediated by the cyclic adenosine monophosphate/protein kinase A (cAMP/PKA) cascade. Genistein directly stimulates the plasma membrane-associated adenylate cyclases, leading to activation of the cAMP signaling pathway. In addition, genistein activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, ligand-activated nuclear receptors important to normal vascular function. Furthermore, genistein reduces reactive oxygen species (ROS) by attenuating the expression of ROS-producing enzymes. These findings reveal the roles for genistein in the regulation of vascular function and provide a basis for further investigating its therapeutic potential for inflammatory-related vascular disease.

426,Methanethiol,"Methanethiol (also known as methyl mercaptan or MeSH) is a colorless gas that smells like rotten cabbage or rotten eggs. It is a natural substance found in the blood, brain, and other tissues of people and animals. It is released from animal feces. It occurs naturally in certain foods, such as some nuts, radishes and cheese. Methanethiol is also a byproduct of the metabolism of asparagus (PMID: 2757887). The ability to produce methanethiol in urine after eating asparagus was once thought to be a genetic trait. More recent research suggests that the peculiar odor is in fact produced by all humans after consuming asparagus, while the ability to detect it (methanethiol being one of many components in ""asparagus pee"") is in fact the genetic trait. Methanethiol is also one of the main chemicals responsible for bad breath and flatulence. Methanethiol (MeSH) is released as a by-product of kraft pulping in pulp mills and is one of the reasons for the strong, offensive odor associated with pulp mills. Methanethiol is released from decaying organic matter in marshes and is present in the natural gas of certain regions, in coal tar, and in some crude oils. At very high concentrations methanethiol is highly toxic and affects the central nervous system. Methanethiol is quite reactive and will react with dissolved metals in aqueous solutions. Industrially, methanethiol is mainly used to produce methionine, which is used as a dietary component in poultry and animal feed. Methanethiol is also used in the plastic industry as a moderator for free-radical polymerizations and as a precursor in the manufacture of pesticides.

427,Lutein,"Lutein is a common carotenoid xanthophyll found in nature. Carotenoids are among the most common pigments in nature and are natural lipid-soluble antioxidants. More than 600 naturally occurring carotenoids are known. Lutein is one of the two carotenoids (the other is zeaxanthin) that accumulate in the eye lens and macular region of the retina with concentrations in the macula greater than those found in plasma and other tissues. Lutein and zeaxanthin have identical chemical formulas and are isomers, but they are not stereoisomers. The main difference between them is in the location of a double bond in one of the end rings. This difference gives lutein three chiral centers whereas zeaxanthin has two. A relationship between macular pigment optical density, a marker of lutein and zeaxanthin concentration in the macula, and lens optical density, an antecedent of cataractous changes, has been suggested. The xanthophylls may act to protect the eye from ultraviolet phototoxicity via quenching reactive oxygen species and/or other mechanisms. Some observational studies have shown that generous intakes of lutein and zeaxanthin, particularly from certain xanthophyll-rich foods like spinach, kale, yellow carrots, broccoli and eggs, are associated with a significant reduction in the risk for cataract (up to 20%) and for age-related macular degeneration (up to 40%). While the pathophysiology of cataract and age-related macular degeneration is complex and contains both environmental and genetic components, research studies suggest dietary factors including antioxidant vitamins and xanthophylls may contribute to a reduction in the risk of these degenerative eye diseases. Further research is necessary to confirm these observations.

However, in breast cancer, low 8-OHdG expression is associated with poor prognosis, which is partly because of the increased antioxidant mechanisms in breast cancer tissues (PMID: 31651287).",HMDB0003333,NC1=NC2=C(N=C(O)N2[C@H]2C[C@H](O)[C@@H](CO)O2)C(=O)N1,C10H13N5O5,"1S/C10H13N5O5/c11-9-13-7-6(8(18)14-9)12-10(19)15(7)5-1-3(17)4(2-16)20-5/h3-5,16-17H,1-2H2,(H,12,19)(H3,11,13,14,18)/t3-,4+,5+/m0/s1",HCAJQHYUCKICQH-VPENINKCSA-N,"2-amino-8-hydroxy-9-[(2R,4S,5R)-4-hydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)oxolan-2-yl]-6,9-dihydro-1H-purin-6-one",-1.4248954496666668,12.300390460848174,283.2407,283.091668551,1.48e+01 g/l,-1.71,-1.28,8,5,2,155.21999999999997,64.56459999999998,25.821757871975485,8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine,0,0,1.58504759606017,10.087770741834776,1,3,1,0,0,0,MDB00000940,5288
431,Symmetric dimethylarginine,"Symmetric dimethylarginine, also known as N,n'-dimethylarginine or SDMA, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as arginine and derivatives. Arginine and derivatives are compounds containing arginine or a derivative thereof resulting from reaction of arginine at the amino group or the carboxy group, or from the replacement of any hydrogen of glycine by a heteroatom. SDMA is a methylated derivative of the amino acid arginine. Symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) and its enantiomer, Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), are naturally occurring amino acids that were first isolated and characterized in human urine in 1970. They are post-translationally modified forms of arginine generated during normal protein turnover (PMID: 31357472). SDMA is a known uremic toxin as determined by the European Uremic Toxin Work Group (EUTox) (PMID: 12675874). It is considered to be an outstanding biomarker of renal function with end-stage renal disease patients showing the highest levels of SDMA. Elevated levels of SDMA also occur in patients with vascular disease, especially suffering end-stage renal disease. (PMID 12401860). SDMA has also been identified as a pro-inflammatory agent involved in the inflammatory process of chronic kidney disease (CKD), activating NF-κB and resulting in enhanced expression of IL-6 and TNF-α (PMID: 21817129). ADMA and SDMA are independent risk markers for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD).",HMDB0003334,CN\C(NCCC[C@H](N)C(O)=O)=N/C,C8H18N4O2,"1S/C8H18N4O2/c1-10-8(11-2)12-5-3-4-6(9)7(13)14/h6H,3-5,9H2,1-2H3,(H,13,14)(H2,10,11,12)/t6-/m0/s1",HVPFXCBJHIIJGS-LURJTMIESA-N,"(2S)-2-amino-5-[(E)-N',N''-dimethylcarbamimidamido]pentanoic acid",-2.654929684285306,,202.2541,202.14297584,1.56e+00 g/l,-2.94,-2.11,6,4,5,99.74,53.179500000000004,22.224320554292085,"N3, N4-dimethylarginine",0,1,12.401054141729825,2.5397284499921273,1,0,1,0,0,0,MDB00000941,"5244,5258,5288"
432,Oxidized glutathione,"Oxidized glutathione is a glutathione dimer formed by a disulfide bond between the cysteine sulfhydryl side chains during the course of being oxidized. Glutathione participates in leukotriene synthesis and is a cofactor for the enzyme glutathione peroxidase. It is also important as a hydrophilic molecule that is added to lipophilic toxins and waste in the liver during biotransformation before they can become part of the bile. glutathione is also needed for the detoxification of methylglyoxal, a toxin produced as a by-product of metabolism. This detoxification reaction is carried out by the glyoxalase system. Glyoxalase I (EC 4.4.1.5) catalyzes the conversion of methylglyoxal and reduced glutathione to S-D-Lactoyl-glutathione. Glyoxalase II (EC 3.1.2.6) catalyzes the hydrolysis of S-D-Lactoyl-glutathione to glutathione and D-lactate.↵",HMDB0003337,NC(CCC(=O)NC(CSSCC(NC(=O)CCC(N)C(O)=O)C(=O)NCC(O)=O)C(=O)NCC(O)=O)C(O)=O,C20H32N6O12S2,"1S/C20H32N6O12S2/c21-9(19(35)36)1-3-13(27)25-11(17(33)23-5-15(29)30)7-39-40-8-12(18(34)24-6-16(31)32)26-14(28)4-2-10(22)20(37)38/h9-12H,1-8,21-22H2,(H,23,33)(H,24,34)(H,25,27)(H,26,28)(H,29,30)(H,31,32)(H,35,36)(H,37,38)",YPZRWBKMTBYPTK-UHFFFAOYSA-N,(2S)-2-amino-4-{[(1R)-2-{[(2R)-2-[(4S)-4-amino-4-carboxybutanamido]-2-[(carboxymethyl)carbamoyl]ethyl]disulfanyl}-1-[(carboxymethyl)carbamoyl]ethyl]carbamoyl}butanoic acid,-10.109054127323455,2.0279192452272095,612.631,612.151961898,4.06e-01 g/l,-3.60,-3.18,14,10,21,317.64000000000004,136.65439999999995,58.46704569941549,glutathione disulfide,0,-2,9.613061090727257,1.4383679148014101,0,0,0,0,0,0,MDB00000942,"5183,5242"
433,D-Glutamic acid,"There are two forms of glutamic acid found in nature: L-glutamic acid and D-glutamic acid. D-glutamic acid, is not endogenously produced in higher mammals. It is found naturally primarily in the cell walls of certain bacteria. D-glutamate is also present in certain foods e.g., soybeans and also arises from the turnover of the intestinal tract microflora, whose cell walls contain significant D-glutamate. Unlike other D-amino acids, D-glutamate is not oxidized by the D-amino acid oxidases, and therefore this detoxification pathway is not available for handling D-glutamate. Likewise, D-glutamic acid, when ingested, largely escapes most deamination reactions (unlike the L-counterpart). Free D-glutamate is found in mammalian tissue at surprisingly high levels, with D-glutamate accounting for 9% of the total glutamate present in liver. D-glutamate is the most potent natural inhibitor of glutathione synthesis identified to date and this may account for its localization to the liver, since circulating D-glutamate may alter redox stabiity (PMID 11158923).

D-Serine is synthesized in neurons by the enzyme known as serine racemase from L-serine (its enantiomer). D-serine serves as a neuromodulator by coactivating NMDA receptors, making them able to open if they then also bind glutamate. D-serine is a potent agonist at the glycine site (NR1) of the NMDA-type glutamate receptor (NMDAR). D-serine is a more potent agonist at the glycine site on the NMDAR than glycine itself (PMID: 10781100).  Apart from it role in signalling in the central nervous system, D-serine plays a signaling role in peripheral tissues and organs such as cartilage, kidney, and corpus cavernosum (PMID: 17929246).

These are amino acids having a (-NH2) group attached to the gamma carbon atom. It is the 4-guanidino derivative of butanoic acid. 4-Guanidinobutanoic acid is a normal metabolite present in low concentrations in most biofluids. Patients with hyperargininemia have an arginase deficiency which leads to blockade of the urea cycle in the last step with several clinical symptoms. Owing to the arginase deficiency this patients accumulate arginine which leads eventually to the accumulation of epileptogenic guanidino compounds (PMID 7752905).

Calcidiol is converted in the kidneys (by the enzyme 25(OH)D-1α-hydroxylase) into calcitriol (1,25-(OH)2D3), a secosteroid hormone that is the active form of vitamin D. Calcidiol can also be converted into 24-hydroxycalcidiol in the kidneys via 24-hydroxylation. Calcidiol is the major circulating metabolite of vitamin D3 (calciferon or cholecalciferol). It is produced in the liver and is the best indicator of the body's vitamin D stores. Clinically, the blood concentration of calcidiol is considered the best biomarker of vitamin D status and is commonly used to diagnose vitamin D deficiencies. The normal range of calcidiol in the blood is 30.0 to 74.0 ng/mL, however, this varies widely depending on several factors, including age and geographic location.  Calcidiol is effective in the treatment of rickets and osteomalacia, both in azotemic and non-azotemic patients.

439,Mercury,"Mercury is a metal that is a liquid at room temperature. Mercury has a long and interesting history deriving from its use in medicine and industry. Mercury is also a highly toxic compound that can form conjugates with various organic compounds leading to compounds such as methylmercury and dimethylmercury. In high enough doses, all forms of mercury can produce toxicity. The most devastating tragedies related to mercury toxicity in recent history include Minamata Bay and Niagata, Japan in the 1950s, and Iraq in the 1970s. More recent mercury toxicity issues include the extreme toxicity of dimethylmercury noted in 1998, the possible toxicity related to dental amalgams, and the disproved relationship between vaccines and autism related to the presence of the mercury-containing preservative, thimerosal. Hair has been used in many studies as a bioindicator of mercury exposure for human populations. At the time of hair formation, mercury from the blood capillaries penetrates into the hair follicles. As hair grows approximately 1 cm each month, mercury exposure over time is recapitulated in hair strands. Mercury levels in hair closest to the scalp reflect the most recent exposure, while those farthest from the scalp are representative of previous blood concentrations. Sequential analyses of hair mercury have been useful for identifying seasonal variations over time in hair mercury content, which may be the result of seasonal differences in bioavailability of fish and differential consumption of piscivorous and herbivorous fish species. Knowledge of the relation between fish-eating practices and hair mercury levels is particularly important for adequate mitigation strategies. Physiologically, it exists as an ion in the body. Methyl mercury is well absorbed, and because the biological half-life is long, the body burden in humans may reach high levels. People who frequently eat contaminated seafood can acquire mercury concentrations that are potentially dangerous to the fetus in pregnant women. The dose-response relationships have been extensively studied, and the safe levels of exposure have tended to decline. Individual methyl mercury exposure is usually determined by analysis of mercury in blood and hair. Whilst the clinical features of acute mercury poisoning have been well described, chronic low dose exposure to mercury remains poorly characterised and its potential role in various chronic disease states remains controversial. Low molecular weight thiols, i.e. sulfhydryl containing molecules such as cysteine, are emerging as important factors in the transport and distribution of mercury throughout the body due to the phenomenon of ""Molecular Mimicry"" and its role in the molecular transport of mercury. Chelation agents such as the dithiols sodium 2,3-dimercaptopropanesulfate (DMPS) and meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) are the treatments of choice for mercury toxicity. Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), a disulfide, and its metabolite dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA), a dithiol, have also been shown to have chelation properties when used in an appropriate manner. Whilst N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) and glutathione (GSH) have been recommended in the treatment of mercury toxicity in the past, an examination of available evidence suggests these agents may in fact be counterproductive. Zinc and selenium have also been shown to exert protective effects against mercury toxicity, most likely mediated by induction of the metal binding proteins metallothionein and selenoprotein-P. Evidence suggests however that the co-administration of selenium and dithiol chelation agents during treatment may also be counter-productive. Finally, the issue of diagnostic testing for chronic, historical or low dose mercury poisoning is considered including an analysis of the influence of ligand interactions and nutritional factors upon the accuracy of ""chelation challenge"" tests.

441,Cadmium,"Cadmium (group IIB of the periodic table of elements) is a heavy metal. It is not a naturally occurring metal in biological systems. Cadmium poses severe risks to human health. Physiologically, it exists as an ion in the body. Up to this day, it has not been shown that cadmium has any physiological function within the human body. Interest has therefore risen in its biohazardous potential. As first described by Friedrich Stromeyer (Gottingen, Germany) in 1817, cadmium intoxication can lead to kidney, bone, and pulmonary damage. Cadmium is widely used in industrial processes, e.g as an anticorrosive agent, as a stabilizer in PVC products, as a colour pigment, a neutron absorber in nuclear power plants, and in the fabrication of nickel cadmium batteries. Phosphate fertilizers also show a big cadmium load. Although some cadmium containing products can be recycled, a large share of the general cadmium pollution is caused by dumping and incinerating cadmium polluted waste. In Scandinavia for example, cadmium concentration in agricultural soil increases by 0.2 percent per year. Total global emission of cadmium amounts to 7000 t/year. The maximum permissible value for workers according to German law is 15 ug/l. For comparison: Non-smokers show an average cadmium blood concentration of 0.5 ug/l. Basically there are three possible ways of cadmium resorption: Gastrointestinal, pulmonary and dermal. The uptake through the human gastrointestinal is approximately 5 percent of an ingested amount of cadmium, depending on the exact dose and nutritional composition. The major source of inhalative cadmium intoxication is cigarette smoke. The human lung resorbes 40 to 60 percent of the cadmium in tobacco smoke. Little research has been done on dermal absorption of cadmium. Two mechanisms facilitate cadmium absorption by the skin: binding of a free cadmium ion to sulfhydryl radicals of cysteine in epidermal keratins, or an induction and complexing with metallothionein. Once taken up by the blood, the majority of cadmium is transported bound to proteins, such as Albumin and Metallothionein. The first organ reached after cadmium uptake into the GI-blood is the liver. Here cadmium induces the production of Metallothionein. After consecutive hepatocyte necrosis and apoptosis, Cd-Metallothionein complexes are washed into sinusoidal blood. From here, parts of the absorbed cadmium enter the entero-hepatical cycle via secretion into the biliary tract in form of Cadmium-glutathione conjugates. Enzymatically degraded to cadmium-cysteine complexes in the biliary tree, cadmium reenters the small intestines. The main organ for long-term cadmium accumulation is the kidney. Here the half life period for cadmium is approximately 10 years. A life long intake can therefore lead to a cadmium accumulation in the kidney, consequently resulting in tubulus cell necrosis. The blood concentration of cadmium serves as a reliable indicator for a recent exposition, while the urinary concentration reflects past exposure, body burden and renal accumulation. Excretion of Cadmium takes place via faeces and urine (PMID: 16961932). Cadmium has been proposed as a risk factor for age-related macular degeneration (AMD), an eye disease that can blur your central vision. In adults (>18 years old) cadmium is elevated in the blood at a concentration of 4.4 +/- 2.5 μM (PMID: 17631267) compared to normal adults at a concentration of 0.0049 (0.0018-0.011) μM (Geigy Scientific). Cadmium is also associated with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD).

444,15(S)-HETE,"15(S)-HETE is a hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid. Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) are formed by the 5-, 12- and 15-lipoxygenase (LO) pathways. 5- and 12-LO products are mainly proinflammatory in the skin whereas the main 15-LO product 15-HETE has anti-inflammatory capacities. In vitro 15-HETE has been shown to inhibit LTB4 formation, 12-HETE formation and specifically inhibits the neutrophil chemotactic effect of LTB4. The inhibition of LTB4 formation is probably due to modulation of the 5-LO because no changes in PGE2 formation have been determined. In vivo, 15-HETE inhibits LTB4-induced erythema and edema, and reduces LTB4 in the synovial fluid of carragheenan-induced experimental arthritis in dogs. 15-HETE has also some immunomodulatory effects. It inhibits the mixed lymphocyte reaction, induces generation of murine cytotoxic suppressor T cells, and it decreases interferon production by murine lymphoma cells. Furthermore, IL-4 and IL-13 have recently been shown to be potent activators of the 15-LO in mononuclear cells.

445,(S)-N-Methylsalsolinol,"(S)-N-Methylsalsolinol or N-methyl(S)salsolinol or (NM(S)Sal) or N-methyl-(S)-SAL is a dopamine-derived endogenous isoquinoline. Specifically it is a 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline derivative (TIQ).  TIQs exhibit neurotoxicity (PMID: 19034892). N-Methylsalsolinol exists as two isomers, (S)-N-Methylsalsolinol and (R)-N-Methylsalsolinol. The (S)-N-Methylsalsolinol isomer is much less abundant in the while the (R)-N-Methylsalsolinol is much more abundant in the human brain.  (R)-N-Methylsalsolinol is up to 1000 times more potent in inducing Parkinsonism than (S)-N-Methylsalsolinol. (PMID: 19034892). (R)-N-Methylsalsolinol is an MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine)-like neurotoxin that may cause Parkinson's disease. In the cerebrospinal fluid from newly diagnosed untreated patients with Parkinson's disease, the level of (R)-N-Methylsalsolinol was found to increase significantly, compared to both healthy controls and a disease control called multiple system atrophy. Levels of N-methyl(R)salsolinol in the cerebrospinal fluid may indicate remaining dopamine neurons in the parkinsonian brain. (PMID 10076861).

These are amino acids having a (-NH2) group attached to the beta carbon atom. 3-aminoisobutanoic acid is a product formed by the catabolism of thymine. It is also a myokine (a signalling molecule produced by muscles) that is generated by skeletal muscle during physical activity. In addition to physical activity, the circulating levels of BAIBA are controlled by the mitochondrial enzyme alanine: glyoxylate aminotransferase 2 (AGXT2), which is primarily expressed in the liver and kidneys. Recent studies have shown that BAIBA can protect from diet-induced obesity in animal models. It induces the transition of white adipose tissue to a ""beige"" or brown fat phenotype, which induces fatty acids oxidation and increases insulin sensitivity (PMID: 30823446). Additionally, serum levels of BAIBA have a positive association with physical activity and bone mineral density.

447,Pentosidine,"Pentosidine is a carbohydrate-derived advanced glycation end products (AGEs) that is considerably elevated in uremic patients. Derived from ribose, a pentose, pentosidine forms fluorescent cross-links between the arginine and lysine residues in collagen. It is formed in a reaction of the amino acids with the Maillard reaction products of ribose. Although it is present only in trace concentrations among tissue proteins, it is useful for assessing cumulative damage to proteins-advanced glycation endproductsThis compound per se has no biological activities but is highly correlated to the levels of precursors of carbonyl compounds, and for this reason is considered a reliable surrogate marker for AGEs. The modification of proteins in uremia is not limited to AGEs, since advanced lipoxidation end products are also demonstrable in plasma proteins in uremia. The accumulation of these compounds does not seem to be dependent only on the decline of renal function. Carbonyl precursors of AGEs and advanced lipoxidation end products are markedly elevated in uremic patients. Preliminary cross-sectional studies in haemodialysis patients seem to indicate that the AGEs and carbonyl stress may be involved in the pathogenesis of alterations in left ventricular geometry and function in these patients. (PMID 11051031) - The plasma pentosidine level in diabetic nephropathy was found to be determined by factors such as renal function control of glucose and the patient's age; of these, renal function was the most critical factor. The pathological role of AGEs in diabetic nephropathy, is in the expanded mesangial area of diffuse diabetic glomerulosclerosis, with nodular lesions, characteristic of diabetic nephropathy. These suggests a potential link of AGEs accumulation, which may be determined by renal function, control of glucose and age, to renal tissue damage in diabetic nephropathy. (PMID 9044316) - The rate of accumulation of glycoxidation products is accelerated in diabetes and age-adjusted concentrations of two advanced glycation end-products (AGE) in tissue proteins, N(6)-carboxymethyllysine and pentosidine, correlate with the severity of complication in diabetic patients.

448,Selenomethionine,"Selenomethionine is an amino acid containing selenium that cannot be synthesized by higher animals, but can be obtained from plant material. Selenomethionine is the major seleno-compound in cereal grains (wheat grain, maize and rice), soybeans and enriched yeast. Seleno-compounds present in plants may have a profound effect upon the health of animals and human subjects. It is now known that the total Se content cannot be used as an indication of its efficacy, but knowledge of individual selenocompounds is necessary to fully assess the significance. Thus, speciation of the seleno-compounds has moved to the forefront. Since animals and man are dependent upon plants for their nutritional requirements, this makes the types of seleno-compounds in plants even more critical. Se enters the food chain through incorporation into plant proteins, mostly as selenocysteine and selenomethionine at normal Se levels. There are two possible pathways for the catabolism of selenomethionine. One is the transsulfuration pathway via selenocystathionine to produce selenocysteine, which in turn is degraded to H2Se by the enzyme b-lyase. The other pathway is the transamination-decarboxylation pathway. It was estimated that 90% of methionine is metabolized through this pathway and thus could be also the major route for selenomethionine catabolism.

Alpha-Carotene belongs to the class of organic compounds known as carotenes. These are a type of unsaturated hydrocarbon containing eight consecutive isoprene units. They are characterized by the presence of two end-groups (mostly cyclohexene rings, but also cyclopentene rings or acyclic groups) linked by a long branched alkyl chain. Alpha-Carotene is considered to be an isoprenoid lipid molecule. It is the second most common form of carotene. Carrots, sweet potatoes, pumpkin, winter squash, broccoli, green beans, spinach, avocado and turnips are rich in alpha-carotene. About 600–700 different carotenoids are known of which alpha and beta-carotene, lycopene, lutein, and zeaxanthin are the most prominent ones. Alpha-Carotene has provitamin A activity and is a precursor for vitamin A. Based on its structure, Alpha-Carotene is converted to one molecule of biologically active retinol after central cleavage, whereas Beta-Carotene yields twice the molar amount of retinol upon cleavage.

450,Melanin,"Melanin is a tyrosine-derived pigment. Melanin is both a biopolymer and a neuropeptide. It exists in the plant, animal and protista kingdoms, where it serves as a pigment. In mammals, melanin is thought to protect skin cells from UVB radiation damage, reducing the risk of folate depletion and dermal degradation as well as reducing the risk of skin cancer. It is produced through a multistage chemical process known as melanogenesis, where the oxidation of the amino acid tyrosine is followed by polymerization. The melanin pigments are produced in a specialized group of cells known as melanocytes. Although human beings generally possess a similar concentration of melanocytes in their skin, the melanocytes in some individuals and races more frequently or less frequently express the melanin-producing genes, thereby conferring a greater or lesser concentration of skin melanin. Some individual animals and humans have no or very little melanin in their bodies, which is a condition known as albinism. There are three basic types of melanin: eumelanin, pheomelanin, and neuromelanin. The most common type is eumelanin, of which there are two types— brown eumelanin and black eumelanin. Pheomelanin is a cysteine-derivative that contains polybenzothiazine portions that are largely responsible for the color of red hair, among other pigmentation. Neuromelanin is found in the brain. Both pheomelanin and eumelanin are found in human skin and hair, but eumelanin is the most abundant melanin in humans, as well as the form most likely to be deficient in albinism. Freckles and moles are formed where there is a localized concentration of melanin in the skin.

451,Anandamide,"Anandamide (AEA) is a fatty acid neurotransmitter derived from the metabolism of eicosatetraenoic acid (arachidonic acid), an essential omega-6 fatty acid. It is a highly potent endogenous agonist of the cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors. CB1 receptors are predominantly found in the central nervous system (CNS) where they mainly mediate the psychotropic effects of Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and endocannabinoids, whereas the expression of the CB2 receptor is thought to be restricted to cells of the immune system. Anandamide plays a role in the regulation of feeding behavior, and the neural generation of motivation and pleasure. Interestingly anandamide is also found in chocolate, which may help to explain some of its pleasurable effects (PMID: 8751435). Anandamide is also important for implantation of the early stage embryo in its blastocyst form into the uterus. As a result, anandamide has been proposed as a biomarker of infertility, but so far lacks any predictive values in order to be used clinically. High fat diets increase the level of anandamide in the liver and so ananamide may also play a role in the development of obesity Endogenous anandamide is present at very low levels and has a very short half-life due to the action of the enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), which breaks AEA down into free arachidonic acid and ethanolamine. The analgesic effects of acetaminophen may be explained by anandamide. Acetaminophen is metabolically combined with arachidonic acid by FAAH to form AM404 (PMID 15987694). This metabolite of acetaminophen is a potent agonist for the TRPV1 vanilloid receptor, a weak agonist at both CB1 and CB2 receptors, and an inhibitor of anandamide reuptake. As a result, anandamide levels in the body and brain are elevated. In effect, acetaminophen acts as a pro-drug for a cannabimimetic metabolite. AEA has been shown to inhibit breast cell cancer proliferation (PMID 9653194). It might inhibit tumor cell proliferation or induce apoptosis via interaction with the type 1 vanilloid receptor (TRPV1). TRPV1 is an ion channel expressed almost exclusively by sensory neurons, activated by pH, noxious heat (>48 degrees centigrade) and plant toxins and is thought to play an important role in nociception. Cervical cancer cells are sensitive to AEA-induced apoptosis via TRPV1 that is aberrantly expressed in vitro and in vivo while CB1 and CB2 receptors play a protective role.

About 60% of antimony is consumed in flame retardants, and 20% is used in alloys for batteries, plain bearings, and solders. Physiologically, antimony exists as an ion in the body. The toxicology of antimony and its compounds is known from three sources: its medicinal use over centuries, studies of process workers in more recent times, and more recent still, studies of its presence in modern city environments and in domestic environments. Gross exposure to antimony compounds over long periods, usually the sulfide (SbS3) or the oxide (Sb2O3) has occurred in antimony miners and in antimony process workers. Inhalation of antimony trioxide (and similar poorly soluble Sb(III) dust particles such as antimony dust) is considered harmful and suspected of causing cancer. However, these effects are only observed with female rats and after long-term exposure to high dust concentrations. Occupational exposure may cause respiratory irritation, pneumoconiosis, antimony spots on the skin, gastrointestinal symptoms, and cardiac arrhythmias.

457,Prostaglandin B2,"Prostaglandin B2 (PGB2) is a prostanoid. Prostanoids is a term that collectively describes prostaglandins, prostacyclines and thromboxanes. Prostanoids are a subclass of the lipid mediator group known as eicosanoids. They derive from C-20 polyunsaturated fatty acids, mainly dihomo-gamma-linoleic (20:3n-6), arachidonic (20:4n-6), and eicosapentaenoic (20:5n-3) acids, through the action of cyclooxygenases-1 and -2 (COX-1 and COX-2). The reaction product of COX is the unstable endoperoxide prostaglandin H (PGH) that is further transformed into the individual prostanoids by a series of specific prostanoid synthases. Prostanoids are local-acting mediators formed and inactivated within the same or neighbouring cells prior to their release into circulation as inactive metabolites (15-keto- and 13,14-dihydroketo metabolites). Non-enzymatic peroxidation of arachidonic acid and other fatty acids in vivo can result in prostaglandin-like substances isomeric to the COX-derived prostaglandins that are termed isoprostanes. Prostanoids take part in many physiological and pathophysiological processes in practically every organ, tissue and cell, including the vascular, renal, gastrointestinal and reproductive systems. Their activities are mediated through prostanoid-specific receptors and intracellular signalling pathways, whilst their biosynthesis and action are blocked by nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID). Isoprostanes are considered to be reliable markers of oxidant stress status and have been linked to inflammation, ischaemia-reperfusion, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, reproductive disorders and diabetes.

460,4-Hydroxynonenal,"4-Hydroxynonenal (HNE), is an alpha,beta-unsaturated hydroxyalkenal that is produced by lipid peroxidation in cells. It is one of the major end products of lipid peroxidation, has been shown to be involved in signal transduction and available evidence suggests that it can affect cell cycle events in a concentration-dependent manner. glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) can modulate the intracellular concentrations of HNE by affecting its generation during lipid peroxidation by reducing hydroperoxides and also by converting it into a glutathione conjugate. Overexpression of the Alpha class GSTs in cells leads to lower steady-state levels of HNE, and these cells acquire resistance to apoptosis induced by lipid peroxidation-causing agents such as H2O2, UVA, superoxide anion, and pro-oxidant xenobiotics, suggesting that signaling for apoptosis by these agents is transduced through HNE. Cells with the capacity to exclude HNE from the intracellular environment at a faster rate are relatively more resistant to apoptosis caused by H2O2, UVA, superoxide anion, and pro-oxidant xenobiotics as well as by HNE, suggesting that HNE may be a common denominator in mechanisms of apoptosis caused by oxidative stress. Transfection of adherent cells with HNE-metabolizing GSTs leads to transformation of these cells due to depletion of HNE.

461,Lipoxin A4,"Lipoxin A4 (LXA4) is a bioactive autacoid metabolite of arachidonic acid made by various cell types. It was first identified in 1984 by Serhan and colleagues as 5-lipoxygenase interaction product (a lipoxin) of activated leukocytes. Initially, two lipoxins were identified, lipoxin A4 (LXA4) and LXB4, but more recent studies have identified epimers of these two LXs: the epi-lipoxins, 15-epi-LXA4 and 15-epi-LXB4 respectively. Endogenous transcellular biosynthesis of LXA4 occurs via interaction of leukocytes with epithelium, endothelium or platelets. Lipoxins (LXs) or the lipoxygenase interaction products are generated from arachidonic acid via sequential actions of lipoxygenases and subsequent reactions to give specific trihydroxytetraene-containing eicosanoids. These unique structures are formed during cell-cell interactions and appear to act at both temporal and spatially distinct sites from other eicosanoids produced during the course of inflammatory responses and to stimulate natural resolution. Lipoxin A4 (LXA4) and lipoxin B4 (LXB4) are positional isomers that each possesses potent cellular and in vivo actions. These LX structures are conserved across species. The results of numerous studies confirm that they are the first recognized eicosanoid chemical mediators that display both potent anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving actions in vivo in disease models that include rabbit, rat, and mouse systems. LXs act at specific GPCRs as agonists to regulate cellular responses of interest in inflammation and resolution. Aspirin has a direct impact in the LX circuit by triggering the biosynthesis of endogenous epimers of LX, termed the aspirin-triggered 15-epi-LX, that share the potent anti-inflammatory actions of LX.

462,Lead,"Lead is one of the oldest known and most widely studied occupational and environmental toxins. Despite intensive study, there is still vigorous debate about the toxic effects of lead, both from low level exposure in the general population owing to environmental pollution and historic use of lead in paint and plumbing and from exposure in the occupational setting. The majority of industries historically associated with high lead exposure have made dramatic advances in their control of occupational exposure. However, cases of unacceptably high exposure and even of frank lead poisoning are still seen, predominantly in the demolition and tank cleaning industries. Nevertheless, in most industries blood lead levels have declined below levels at which signs or symptoms are seen and the current focus of attention is on the subclinical effects of exposure. The significance of some of these effects for the overt health of the workers is often the subject of debate. Inevitably there is pressure to reduce lead exposure in the general population and in working environments, but any legislation must be based on a genuine scientific evaluation of the available evidence. Physiologically, it exists as an ion in the body. Inorganic lead is undoubtedly one of the oldest occupational toxins and evidence of lead poisoning can be found dating back to Roman times. As industrial lead production started at least 5000 years ago, it is likely that outbreaks of lead poisoning occurred from this time. These episodes of poisoning were not limited to lead workers. The general population could be significantly exposed owing to poorly glazed ceramic ware, the use of lead solder in the food canning industry, high levels of lead in drinking water, the use of lead compounds in paint and cosmetics and by deposition on crops and dust from industrial and motor vehicle sources. It was an important cause of morbidity and mortality during the Industrial Revolution and effective formal control of lead workers did not occur until the pioneering occupational health work of Ronald Lane in 1949. At very high blood lead levels, lead is a powerful abortifacient. At lower levels, it has been associated with miscarriages and low birth weights of infants. Predominantly to protect the developing fetus, legislation for lead workers often includes lower exposure criteria for women of reproductive capacity. Studies have shown a slowing of sensory motor reaction time in male lead workers and some disturbance of cognitive function in workers with blood lead levels >40 ig/100 ml. Peripheral motor neuropathy is seen as a result of chronic high-level lead exposure, but there is conflicting, although on the whole convincing, evidence of a reduction in peripheral nerve conduction velocity at lower blood lead levels. The threshold has been suggested to be as low as 30 ug/100 ml, although other studies have not seen effects below a blood lead level of 70 ug/100 ml. Several large epidemiological studies of lead workers have found inconclusive evidence of an association between lead exposure and the incidence of cancer. However, based on closer analysis the increase did not appear to be related to lead exposure. There was also a small but significant increase in the incidence of lung cancer, but this could have been the result of confounding from cigarette smoking or concurrent arsenic exposure. There is some evidence in humans that there is an association between low level lead exposure and blood pressure, but the results are inconsistent. Lead appears to reduce the resistance and increase the mortality of experimental animals. It apparently impairs antibody production and decreases immunoglobulin plaque forming cells. There is some evidence for suggesting that workers with blood lead levels between 20 and 85 ug/100 ml may have an increased susceptibility to colds, but a study of lead workers with blood lead levels less than 50 ug/100 ml showed no significant immunological changes. Although it is widely accepted that personal hygiene is the most important determinant of an individual's blood lead level, recent interesting information has shown that genetic polymorphism may also have an impact. The use of most of these chemicals is declining with the gradual demise of the use of lead in petrol, but lead naphthenates and stearates are still used in stabilizers for plastics and as lead 'soaps'. In fact, the only compound now produced for petrol usage is tetraethyl lead. Exposure is only seen during the production, transportation and blending of this substance into petrol and in workers involved in cleaning storage tanks that have contained leaded petrol.

463,O-Desmethylangolensin,"O-Desmethylangolensin (ODMA) is a metabolite of the soy isoflavone daidzein. It is generated by intestinal bacteria in approximately 80-90% of persons. Studies suggest beneficial health effects associated with daidzein-metabolizing phenotypes, and there is some small association between ODMA production and some phenotypes. Few dietary factors are associated with daidzein-metabolizing phenotypes. However, it remains unclear why some, but not all, persons harbor ODMA-producing bacteria. ODMA production is inversely associated with age, height, weight, and body mass index. In addition, Asians are less likely than whites to be ODMA producers, and former smokers were more likely than never smokers to be ODMA producers. Investigators have attempted to identify the bacteria involved in ODMA production, and several candidate bacteria were associated, but not definitely identified. ODMA production is correlated with the abundance of methanogens, indicating that the metabolic fate of daidzein may be related to intestinal H(2) metabolism.

465,"13,14-Dihydro-15-keto PGF2a","13,14-dihydro-15-keto PGF2a E1 is an isoprostane. The isoprostanes embody a vast family of novel prostaglandin-like lipids that are produced by nonenzymatic peroxidation of arachidonic acid (AA) in response to free radicals and reactive oxygen species. Although free AA is required for the formation of prostaglandins by cyclooxygenases, the isoprostanes can be generated nonenzymatically from esterified AA in membrane phospholipids before being released by a phospholipase(s). Another dissimilarity is that isoprostanes feature side chains that are almost exclusively orientated cis relative to the cyclopentane ring and are therefore distinct from the prostaglandins, which always have side chains in the trans configuration. Nevertheless, isoprostanes are isomeric with prostaglandins and have been given the prefix D-, E-, and F{alpha}- to denote the prostane ring shared with PGD2, PGE2, and PGF2{alpha} respectively. An additional level of complexity is that peroxidation of AA can occur at one of any of four carbon atoms producing regioisomers, the so-called 5-, 12-, 8-, and 15-series isoprostanes, each consisting of eight racemic diastereomers. Thus, a total of 64 isomers can be generated for each of the D-, E-, and F{alpha}-ring isoprostanes. (PMID: 15528403)' - Prostaglandins are eicosanoids. The eicosanoids consist of the prostaglandins (PGs), thromboxanes (TXs), leukotrienes (LTs) and lipoxins (LXs). The PGs and TXs are collectively identified as prostanoids. Prostaglandins were originally shown to be synthesized in the prostate gland, thromboxanes from platelets (thrombocytes) and leukotrienes from leukocytes, hence the derivation of their names. All mammalian cells except erythrocytes synthesize eicosanoids. These molecules are extremely potent, able to cause profound physiological effects at very dilute concentrations. All eicosanoids function locally at the site of synthesis, through receptor-mediated G-protein linked signaling pathways.↵",HMDB0004685,CCCCCC(=O)CC[C@H]1[C@H](O)C[C@H](O)[C@@H]1C\C=C/CCCC(O)=O,C20H34O5,"1S/C20H34O5/c1-2-3-6-9-15(21)12-13-17-16(18(22)14-19(17)23)10-7-4-5-8-11-20(24)25/h4,7,16-19,22-23H,2-3,5-6,8-14H2,1H3,(H,24,25)/b7-4-/t16-,17-,18+,19-/m1/s1",VKTIONYPMSCHQI-XAGFEHLVSA-N,"(5Z)-7-[(1R,2R,3R,5S)-3,5-dihydroxy-2-(3-oxooctyl)cyclopentyl]hept-5-enoic acid",3.024569415666666,14.546683647943198,354.481,354.240624198,1.07e-01 g/l,3.12,-3.52,5,3,13,94.83000000000001,98.47999999999999,40.996519513409766,"13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGF2α",0,-1,-2.86345736064329,4.30630545882051,1,1,1,1,0,0,MDB00001047,5338

470,Lactosylceramide (d18:1/12:0),"Lactosylceramide (d18:1/12:0) is a lactosylceramide or LacCer. Lactosylceramides are the most important and abundant of the diosylceramides. Lactosylceramides (LacCer) were originally called 'cytolipin H'. Lactosylceramides are found in small amounts only in most animal tissues, but they have a number of significant biological functions and it is of great importance as the biosynthetic precursor of most of the neutral oligoglycosylceramides, sulfatides and gangliosides. In animal tissues, biosynthesis of lactosylceramide involves addition of the second monosaccharides unit (galactose) as its nucleotide derivative to monoglucosylceramide, catalysed by a specific beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase on the lumenal side of the Golgi apparatus. The glucosylceramide precursor must first cross from the cytosolic side of the membrane, possibly via the action of a flippase. The lactosylceramide produced can be further glycosylated or transferred to the plasma membrane. Lactosylceramide may assist in stabilizing the plasma membrane and activating receptor molecules in the special micro-domains or rafts, as with the cerebrosides. It may also have its own specialized function in the immunological system in that it is known to bind to specific bacteria. In addition, it is believed that a number of pro-inflammatory factors activate lactosylceramide synthase to generate lactosylceramide, which in turn activates ""oxygen-sensitive"" signalling pathways that affect such cellular processes as proliferation, adhesion, migration and angiogenesis. Dysfunctions in these pathways can affect several diseases of the cardiovascular system, cancer and inflammatory states, so lactosylceramide metabolism is a potential target for new therapeutic treatments. beta-D-Galactosyl-1,4-beta-D-glucosylceramide is the second to last step in the synthesis of N-Acylsphingosine and is converted - from Glucosylceramide via the enzyme beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase 6(EC:2.4.1.-).

Phytoestrogens are a diverse group of compounds found in many edible plants that have, as their common denominator, a phenolic group that they share with estrogenic steroids. This phenolic group appears to play an important role in determining the estrogenic agonist/antagonistic properties of these compounds. Phytoestrogens have been categorized according to their chemical structures as isoflavones, lignans and coumestans. Enterodiol is formed by bacteria in the intestinal tract from the plant lignans matairesinol and secoisolariciresinol, which exist in various whole-grain cereals (barley, rye and wheat), seeds, nuts, legumes and vegetables.

It is found in many plants and foods, such as red wine, onions, green tea, apples, berries, kale, Ginkgo biloba, St. John's wort, American elder, and others. Quercetin has a bitter flavor and is used as an ingredient in dietary supplements, beverages, and foods. Quercetin is the aglycone form of a number of other flavonoid glycosides, such as rutin and quercitrin. Quercetin represents 60% of the total dietary flavonol intake. Quercetin has been reported to inhibit the oxidation of other molecules and hence is classified as an antioxidant. Quercetin also activates or inhibits the activities of a number of proteins. For example, quercetin is a non-specific protein kinase enzyme inhibitor.  Quercetin has also been reported to have estrogenic (female sex hormone-like) activities by activating estrogen receptors. Quercetin activates both estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) and beta (ERbeta).

484,Tetrahydrodeoxycortisol,"Tetrahydrodeoxycortisol (THS) is a mineralocorticoid. It is the main urinary metabolite of 11-deoxycortisol. Urinary excretion of THS is elevated in patients with 11beta-hydroxylase deficiency, a condition resulting from mutations in the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoform CYP11B1. Urinary levels of THS are also elevated in patients with adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) and adrenocortical adenoma (ACA) but are higher in patients with ACC compared to ACA. THS excretion is significantly associated with tetrahydroaldosterone excretion, total androgen excretion, and cortisol metabolites. Aldosterone synthesis is highly heritable and is affected by CYP11B1 genotype variations. Genotype differences in CYP11B1 explains approx. 5% of the variance in urinary THS excretion in the population. Excretion of THS is heritable (19.4%) and the T-allele of the 344 C/T polymorphism of CYP11B2 is more strongly associated with higher THS levels than the C-allele.

485,Hexanal,"Hexanal, also called hexanaldehyde or caproaldehyde is an alkyl aldehyde used in the flavor industry to produce fruity flavors. Its scent resembles freshly cut grass. It is potentially useful as a natural extract that prevents fruit spoilage. It occurs naturally and contributes to a hay-like ""off-note"" flavor in green peas. In foods, hexanal is a volatile compound that has been associated with the development of undesirable flavours. The content of hexanal, which is a major breakdown product of linoleic acid (LA, n - 6 PUFA) oxidation, has been used to follow the course of lipid oxidation and off-flavour development in foods, and have been proposed as one potential marker of milk quality. A ""cardboard-like"" off-flavour is frequently associated with dehydrated milk products. This effect is highly correlated with the headspace concentration of hexanal. (Food Chemistry. Volume 107, Issue 1, 1 March 2008, Pages 558-569, PMID: 17934948, 17487452). Hexanal also occurs naturally in human biofluids. It is a major breakdown product of linoleic acid and is a reactive secondary reactive aldehyde lipid peroxidation product.  Human milk samples collected from women contain hexanal. Among mediators of oxidative stress, highly reactive secondary aldehydic lipid peroxidation products can initiate the processes of spontaneous mutagenesis and carcinogenesis and can also act as a growth-regulating factors and signaling molecules. In specimens obtained from adult patients with brain astrocytomas, lower levels of n-hexanal are associated with poorer patient prognosis.

486,20-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid,"20-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) is a metabolite of arachidonic acid. Cytochrome P450 enzymes of the 4A and 4F families catalyze the omega-hydroxylation of arachidonic acid and produce 20-HETE. 20-HETE is a potent constrictor or renal, cerebral and mesenteric arteries. The vasoconstrictor response to 20-HETE is associated with activation of protein kinase, Rho kinase and the mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway C. 20-HETE also increases intracellular Ca2+ by causing the depolarization of vascular smooth muscle membrane secondary to blocking the large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+-channels and by a direct effect on L-type Ca channels. Elevations in the production of 20-HETE mediate the myogenic response of skeletal, renal and cerebral arteries to elevations in transmural pressure. There is an important interaction between nitric oxide (NO) and the formation of 20-HETE production. NO inhibits the formation of 20-HETE formation in renal and cerebral arteries and that a fall in levels of 20-HETE contributes the cyclic GMP-independent dilator effect of NO to activate the large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+-channels and to dilate the cerebral arteries.

It has traditionally been considered to be a B vitamin although it has an uncertain status as a vitamin and a deficiency syndrome has not been identified in man. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p1379). Results reported by Viola et al (PMID: 15340856) suggest that high CSF concentrations of scyllo-inositol can be induced by chronic alcoholism. scyllo-Inositol (also called ""scyllitol"") when fed to transgenic mice that exhibit a memory disease very similar to human Alzheimer's disease, can block the accumulation of soluble amyloid-beta plaques in the brain.

488,Enterolactone,"Enterolactone is a mammalian lignan that has a similar biphenolic structure to lignans from plants. Lignans are compounds with estrogenic properties and are probably the most important source of phytoestrogens in western diets. Mammalian lignans are formed from precursors that are contained mainly in vegetables, whole grain products and berries, via action of intestinal microflora. Enterolactone is produced in the colon by the action of bacteria on secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol and its glycosides. Secoisolariciresinol is converted to enterodiol which is subsequently converted to enterolactone as it passes through the colon. Matairesinol is converted directly to enterolactone. Enterolactone have been shown to possess weakly estrogenic and antiestrogenic activities, and it has been suggested that the high production of this antiestrogenic mammalian lignans in the gut may serve to protect against breast cancer in women and prostate cancer in men; however epidemiological evidence to date is conflicting.

LO product 12-HETE is associated with pathogenesis of hypertension, and may mediate angiotensin II and TGFbeta induced mesengial cell abnormality in diabetic nephropathy. 12-HETE is markedly elevated in the psoriatic lesions. 12-HETE is a vasoconstrictor eicosanoid that contribute to high blood pressure in (renovascular) hypertension and pregnancy-induced hypertension. A significant percentage of patients suffering from a selective increase in plasma LDL cholesterol (type IIa hyperlipoproteinaemia) exhibits increased platelet reactivity. This includes enhanced platelet responsiveness against a variety of platelet-stimulating agents ex vivo and enhanced arachidonic acid metabolism associated with increased generation of arachidonic acid metabolites such as 12-HETE, and secretion of platelet-storage products.

490,Malondialdehyde,"Malondialdehyde (MDA) is the dialdehyde of malonic acid and a biomarker of oxidative damage to lipids caused by smoking. Oxidized lipids are able to produce MDA as a decomposition product. The mechanism is thought to involve formation of prostaglandin-like endoperoxides from polyunsaturated fatty acids with two or more double bonds. An alternative mechanism is based on successive hydroperoxide formation and Beta-cleavage of polyunsaturated fatty acids. MDA is then directly formed by Beta-scission of a 3-hydroperoxyaldehyde or by reaction between acrolein and hydroxyl radicals. While oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids is the major source of MDA in vivo, other minor sources exists such as byproducts of free radical generation by ionizing radiation and of the biosynthesis of prostaglandins. Aldehydes are generally reactive species capable of forming adducts and complexes in biological systems and MDA is no exception although the main species at physiological pH is the enolate ion which is of relative low reactivity. Consistent evidence is available for the reaction between MDA and cellular macromolecules such as proteins, RNA and DNA. MDA reacts with DNA to form adducts to deoxyguanosine and deoxyadenosine which may be mutagenic and these can be quantified in several human tissues. Oxidative stress is an imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants on a cellular or individual level. Oxidative damage is one result of such an imbalance and includes oxidative modification of cellular macromolecules, induction of cell death by apoptosis or necrosis, as well as structural tissue damage. Chemically speaking, oxidants are compounds capable of oxidizing target molecules. This can take place in three ways: abstraction of hydrogen, abstraction of electrons or addition of oxygen. All cells living under aerobic conditions are continuously exposed to a large numbers of oxidants derived from various endogenous and exogenous sources. The endogenous sources of oxidants are several and include the respiratory chain in the mitochondria, immune reactions, enzymes such as xanthine oxidase and nitric oxide synthase and transition metal mediated oxidation. Various exogenous sources of ROS also contribute directly or indirectly to the total oxidant load. These include effects of ionizing and non-ionizing radiation, air pollution and natural toxic gases such as ozone, and chemicals and toxins including oxidizing disinfectants. A poor diet containing inadequate amounts of nutrients may also indirectly result in oxidative stress by impairing cellular defense mechanisms. The cellular macromolecules, in particular lipids, proteins and DNA, are natural targets of oxidation. Oxidants are capable of initiating lipid oxidation by abstraction of an allylic proton from a polyunsaturated fatty acid. This process, by multiple stages leading to the formation of lipid hydroperoxides, is a known contributor to the development of atherosclerosis.

Phenylacetylglutamine is a normal constituent of human urine, but other mammals including the dog, cat, rat, monkey, sheep and horse do not excrete this compound. Phenylacetyl CoA and glutamine react to form phenylacetyl glutamine and Coenzyme A.

Isovaleraldehyde is a leucine degradation product that has been found in low concentrations in many foods, including beer. It is described as having a malty flavor and has been found in such foods as beer, cheese, coffee, chicken, fish, chocolate, olive oil, and tea. It is also found in elevated concentrations in some cases of hepatic encephalopathy, however not significantly. Fermentation of carbohydrates in the gut (particularly by Bacteroides) produces ethanoic, propionic, butanoic, pentanoic, and hexanoic acid acids which can be converted to aldehydes (such as Isovaleraldehyde) through reductive processes.

493,Clupanodonic acid,"Clupanodonic acid (all-cis-7,10,13,16,19-docosapentaenoic acid) or DPA is an essential omega-3 fatty acid (EFA) which is prevalent in fish oils. Clupanodonic acid, also called Docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), is an intermediary between eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). DPA is a straight chain 22:5 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) which contains 22 carbons and 5 double bonds. DPA is primarily used to designate two isomers, all-cis-4,7,10,13,16-docosapentaenoic acid (i.e. 4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z-docosapentaenoic acid) and all-cis-7,10,13,16,19-docosapentaenoic acid (i.e. 7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z-docosapentaenoic acid). These two isomers are also commonly termed n-6 DPA and n-3 DPA Seal oil is a rich source of clupanodonic acid. There are three functions of clupanodonic acid. The most important is as part of phospholipids in all animal cellular membranes. A deficiency of clupanodonic acid leads to faulty membranes being formed. A second function is in the transport and oxidation of cholesterol: clupanodonic acid tends to lower plasma cholesterol. A third function is as a precursor of prostanoids which are only formed from clupanodonic acid. Deficiency of DAP in experimental animals causes lesions mainly attributable to faulty cellular membranes: sudden failure of growth, lesions of skin and kidney and connective tissue, erythrocyte fragility, impaired fertility, uncoupling of oxidation and phosphorylation. In man pure deficiency of DPA/clupanodonic acid has been studied particularly in persons fed intravenously. A relative deficiency (that is, a low ratio in the body of clupanodonic to long-chain saturated fatty acids and isomers of clupanodonic) is common on Western diets and plays an important part in the causation of atherosclerosis, coronary thrombosis, multiple sclerosis, the triopathy of diabetes mellitus, hypertension and certain forms of malignant disease. Various factors affect the dietary requirement of clupanodonic acid.

494,Aflatoxin B1,"Aflatoxin B1 is an aflatoxin. Aflatoxins are naturally occurring mycotoxins that are produced by many species of Aspergillus, a fungus, most notably Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus. At least 13 different types of aflatoxin are produced in nature. Aflatoxin B1 is considered the most toxic and is produced by both Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus. The native habitat of Aspergillus is in soil, decaying vegetation, hay, and grains undergoing microbiological deterioration and it invades all types of organic substrates whenever conditions are favorable for its growth. Favorable conditions include high moisture content (at least 7%) and high temperature. Aflatoxins B1 (AFB1) are contaminants of improperly stored foods; they are potent genotoxic and carcinogenic compounds, exerting their effects through damage to DNA. They can also induce mutations that increase oxidative damage. (PMID: 17214555). Crops which are frequently affected by Aspergillus contamination include cereals (maize, sorghum, pearl millet, rice, wheat), oilseeds (peanut, soybean, sunflower, cotton), spices (chile peppers, black pepper, coriander, turmeric, ginger), and tree nuts (almond, pistachio, walnut, coconut, brazil nut).↵",HMDB0006552,COC1=C2C3=C(C(=O)CC3)C(=O)OC2=C2C3C=COC3OC2=C1,C17H12O6,"1S/C17H12O6/c1-20-10-6-11-14(8-4-5-21-17(8)22-11)15-13(10)7-2-3-9(18)12(7)16(19)23-15/h4-6,8,17H,2-3H2,1H3",OQIQSTLJSLGHID-UHFFFAOYSA-N,"(3S,7R)-11-methoxy-6,8,19-trioxapentacyclo[10.7.0.0^{2,9}.0^{3,7}.0^{13,17}]nonadeca-1(12),2(9),4,10,13(17)-pentaene-16,18-dione",1.5843809030000005,,312.2736,312.063388116,2.33e-01 g/l,1.73,-3.13,5,0,1,71.06,78.5851,30.135232034841625,"(3S,7R)-11-methoxy-6,8,19-trioxapentacyclo[10.7.0.0^{2,9}.0^{3,7}.0^{13,17}]nonadeca-1(12),2(9),4,10,13(17)-pentaene-16,18-dione",0,0,-4.4404302662976205,17.787312891010785,1,5,1,1,0,0,MDB00001319,

Glucuronidation is used to assist in the excretion of toxic substances, hydrophobic drugs or other substances that cannot be used as an energy source. Glucuronic acid is attached via a glycosidic bond to the substance, and the resulting glucuronide, which has a much higher water solubility than the original substance, is eventually excreted by the kidneys.

532,PC(14:1(9Z)/P-18:1(9Z)),"PC(14:1(9Z)/P-18:1(9Z)) is a phosphatidylcholine (PC or GPCho). It is a glycerophospholipid in which a phosphorylcholine moiety occupies a glycerol substitution site. As is the case with diacylglycerols, glycerophosphocholines can have many different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached at the C-1 and C-2 positions. Fatty acids containing 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. PC(14:1(9Z)/P-18:1(9Z)), in particular, consists of one chain of myristoleic acid at the C-1 position and one chain of plasmalogen 18:1n9 at the C-2 position. The myristoleic acid moiety is derived from milk fats, while the plasmalogen 18:1n9 moiety is derived from animal fats, liver and kidney. Phospholipids, are ubiquitous in nature and are key components of the lipid bilayer of cells, as well as being involved in metabolism and signaling. - While most phospholipids have a saturated fatty acid on C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid on C-2 of the glycerol backbone, the fatty acid distribution at the C-1 and C-2 positions of glycerol within phospholipids is continually in flux, owing to phospholipid degradation and the continuous phospholipid remodeling that occurs while these molecules are in membranes. PCs can be synthesized via three different routes. In one route, choline is activated first by phosphorylation and then by coupling to CDP prior to attachment to phosphatidic acid. PCs can also synthesized by the addition of choline to CDP-activated 1,2-diacylglycerol. A third route to PC synthesis involves the conversion of either PS or PE to PC. Plasmalogens are glycerol ether phospholipids. They are of two types, alkyl ether (-O-CH2-) and alkenyl ether (-O-CH=CH-). Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) serves as the glycerol precursor for the synthesis of plasmalogens. Three major classes of plasmalogens have been identified: choline, ethanolamine and serine derivatives. Ethanolamine plasmalogen is prevalent in myelin. Choline plasmalogen is abundant in cardiac tissue. Usually, the highest proportion of the plasmalogen form is in the ethanolamine class with rather less in choline, and commonly little or none in other phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol. In choline plasmalogens of most tissues, a higher proportion is often of the O-alkyl rather than the O-alkenyl form, but the reverse tends to be true in heart lipids. In animal tissues, the alkyl and alkenyl moieties in both non-polar and phospholipids tend to be rather simple in composition with 16:0, 18:0 and 18:1 (double bond in position 9) predominating.

Plasmalogens are glycerol ether phospholipids. They are of two types, alkyl ether (-O-CH2-) and alkenyl ether (-O-CH=CH-). Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) serves as the glycerol precursor for the synthesis of plasmalogens. Three major classes of plasmalogens have been identified: choline, ethanolamine and serine derivatives. Ethanolamine plasmalogen is prevalent in myelin. Choline plasmalogen is abundant in cardiac tissue. Usually, the highest proportion of the plasmalogen form is in the ethanolamine class with rather less in choline, and commonly little or none in other phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol.

547,PC(16:0/P-18:1(9Z)),"PC(16:0/P-18:1(9Z)) is a phosphatidylcholine (PC or GPCho). It is a glycerophospholipid in which a phosphorylcholine moiety occupies a glycerol substitution site. As is the case with diacylglycerols, glycerophosphocholines can have many different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached at the C-1 and C-2 positions. Fatty acids containing 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. PC(16:0/P-18:1(9Z)), in particular, consists of one chain of palmitic acid at the C-1 position and one chain of plasmalogen 18:1n9 at the C-2 position. The palmitic acid moiety is derived from fish oils, milk fats, vegetable oils and animal fats, while the plasmalogen 18:1n9 moiety is derived from animal fats, liver and kidney. Phospholipids, are ubiquitous in nature and are key components of the lipid bilayer of cells, as well as being involved in metabolism and signaling. - While most phospholipids have a saturated fatty acid on C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid on C-2 of the glycerol backbone, the fatty acid distribution at the C-1 and C-2 positions of glycerol within phospholipids is continually in flux, owing to phospholipid degradation and the continuous phospholipid remodeling that occurs while these molecules are in membranes. PCs can be synthesized via three different routes. In one route, choline is activated first by phosphorylation and then by coupling to CDP prior to attachment to phosphatidic acid. PCs can also synthesized by the addition of choline to CDP-activated 1,2-diacylglycerol. A third route to PC synthesis involves the conversion of either PS or PE to PC. Plasmalogens are glycerol ether phospholipids. They are of two types, alkyl ether (-O-CH2-) and alkenyl ether (-O-CH=CH-). Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) serves as the glycerol precursor for the synthesis of plasmalogens. Three major classes of plasmalogens have been identified: choline, ethanolamine and serine derivatives. Ethanolamine plasmalogen is prevalent in myelin. Choline plasmalogen is abundant in cardiac tissue. Usually, the highest proportion of the plasmalogen form is in the ethanolamine class with rather less in choline, and commonly little or none in other phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol. In choline plasmalogens of most tissues, a higher proportion is often of the O-alkyl rather than the O-alkenyl form, but the reverse tends to be true in heart lipids. In animal tissues, the alkyl and alkenyl moieties in both non-polar and phospholipids tend to be rather simple in composition with 16:0, 18:0 and 18:1 (double bond in position 9) predominating.

Plasmalogens are glycerol ether phospholipids. They are of two types, alkyl ether (-O-CH2-) and alkenyl ether (-O-CH=CH-). Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) serves as the glycerol precursor for the synthesis of plasmalogens. Three major classes of plasmalogens have been identified: choline, ethanolamine and serine derivatives. Ethanolamine plasmalogen is prevalent in myelin. Choline plasmalogen is abundant in cardiac tissue. Usually, the highest proportion of the plasmalogen form is in the ethanolamine class with rather less in choline, and commonly little or none in other phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol. In choline plasmalogens of most tissues, a higher proportion is often of the O-alkyl rather than the O-alkenyl form, but the reverse tends to be true in heart lipids. In animal tissues, the alkyl and alkenyl moieties in both non-polar and phospholipids tend to be rather simple in composition with 16:0, 18:0 and 18:1 (double bond in position 9) predominating. Ether analogues of triacylglycerols, i.e. 1-alkyldiacyl-sn-glycerols, are present at trace levels only if at all in most animal tissues, but they can be major components of some marine lipids.'↵",HMDB0008159,CCCCCCCCCCCCCC\C=C/OC(COC(=O)CCCCCCC\C=C/C\C=C/CCCCC)COP([O-])(=O)OCC[N+](C)(C)C,C42H80NO7P,"1S/C42H80NO7P/c1-6-8-10-12-14-16-18-20-22-23-25-27-29-31-33-35-42(44)48-39-41(40-50-51(45,46)49-38-36-43(3,4)5)47-37-34-32-30-28-26-24-21-19-17-15-13-11-9-7-2/h14,16,20,22,34,37,41H,6-13,15,17-19,21,23-33,35-36,38-40H2,1-5H3/b16-14-,22-20-,37-34-",CQSFBGMPNOVJCB-QIDPJIOXSA-N,"[2-({2-[(1Z)-hexadec-1-en-1-yloxy]-3-[(9Z,12Z)-octadeca-9,12-dienoyloxy]propyl phosphonato}oxy)ethyl]trimethylazanium",8.671865036861588,,742.0609,741.567240431,2.61e-05 g/l,5.87,-7.48,4,0,39,94.12,227.63880000000006,91.78465835814754,lecithin,0,0,-4.757862141822196,1.8550787802405306,0,0,0,0,0,0,MDB00002451,5236

PCs can also synthesized by the addition of choline to CDP-activated 1,2-diacylglycerol. A third route to PC synthesis involves the conversion of either PS or PE to PC. Plasmalogens are glycerol ether phospholipids. They are of two types, alkyl ether (-O-CH2-) and alkenyl ether (-O-CH=CH-). Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) serves as the glycerol precursor for the synthesis of plasmalogens. Three major classes of plasmalogens have been identified: choline, ethanolamine and serine derivatives. Ethanolamine plasmalogen is prevalent in myelin. Choline plasmalogen is abundant in cardiac tissue. Usually, the highest proportion of the plasmalogen form is in the ethanolamine class with rather less in choline, and commonly little or none in other phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol. In choline plasmalogens of most tissues, a higher proportion is often of the O-alkyl rather than the O-alkenyl form, but the reverse tends to be true in heart lipids. In animal tissues, the alkyl and alkenyl moieties in both non-polar and phospholipids tend to be rather simple in composition with 16:0, 18:0 and 18:1 (double bond in position 9) predominating. Ether analogues of triacylglycerols, i.e. 1-alkyldiacyl-sn-glycerols, are present at trace levels only if at all in most animal tissues, but they can be major components of some marine lipids.'↵",HMDB0008192,CCCCCCCCCCCCCC\C=C/OC(COC(=O)CCCC\C=C/C\C=C/C\C=C/CCCCC)COP([O-])(=O)OCC[N+](C)(C)C,C42H78NO7P,"1S/C42H78NO7P/c1-6-8-10-12-14-16-18-20-22-23-25-27-29-31-33-35-42(44)48-39-41(40-50-51(45,46)49-38-36-43(3,4)5)47-37-34-32-30-28-26-24-21-19-17-15-13-11-9-7-2/h14,16,20,22,25,27,34,37,41H,6-13,15,17-19,21,23-24,26,28-33,35-36,38-40H2,1-5H3/b16-14-,22-20-,27-25-,37-34-",XRJDZRCUSSFZDP-LHKYHRLFSA-N,"[2-({2-[(1Z)-hexadec-1-en-1-yloxy]-3-[(6Z,9Z,12Z)-octadeca-6,9,12-trienoyloxy]propyl phosphonato}oxy)ethyl]trimethylazanium",8.30994338019492,,740.045,739.551590367,3.45e-05 g/l,5.83,-7.36,4,0,38,94.12,228.75540000000004,90.66553612323743,lecithin,0,0,-4.7578621516935025,1.8550787802405289,0,0,0,0,0,0,MDB00002484,5338

Plasmalogens are glycerol ether phospholipids. They are of two types, alkyl ether (-O-CH2-) and alkenyl ether (-O-CH=CH-). Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) serves as the glycerol precursor for the synthesis of plasmalogens. Three major classes of plasmalogens have been identified: choline, ethanolamine and serine derivatives. Ethanolamine plasmalogen is prevalent in myelin. Choline plasmalogen is abundant in cardiac tissue. Usually, the highest proportion of the plasmalogen form is in the ethanolamine class with rather less in choline, and commonly little or none in other phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol. In choline plasmalogens of most tissues, a higher proportion is often of the O-alkyl rather than the O-alkenyl form, but the reverse tends to be true in heart lipids. In animal tissues, the alkyl and alkenyl moieties in both non-polar and phospholipids tend to be rather simple in composition with 16:0, 18:0 and 18:1 (double bond in position 9) predominating. Ether analogues of triacylglycerols, i.e. 1-alkyldiacyl-sn-glycerols, are present at trace levels only if at all in most animal tissues, but they can be major components of some marine lipids.'↵",HMDB0008225,CCCCCCCCCCCCCC\C=C/OC(COC(=O)CCCCCCC\C=C/C\C=C/C\C=C/CC)COP([O-])(=O)OCC[N+](C)(C)C,C42H78NO7P,"1S/C42H78NO7P/c1-6-8-10-12-14-16-18-20-22-23-25-27-29-31-33-35-42(44)48-39-41(40-50-51(45,46)49-38-36-43(3,4)5)47-37-34-32-30-28-26-24-21-19-17-15-13-11-9-7-2/h8,10,14,16,20,22,34,37,41H,6-7,9,11-13,15,17-19,21,23-33,35-36,38-40H2,1-5H3/b10-8-,16-14-,22-20-,37-34-",YPDGITFWYDXHDP-WYPAQUOOSA-N,"[2-({2-[(1Z)-hexadec-1-en-1-yloxy]-3-[(9Z,12Z,15Z)-octadeca-9,12,15-trienoyloxy]propyl phosphonato}oxy)ethyl]trimethylazanium",8.30994338019492,,740.045,739.551590367,3.46e-05 g/l,5.82,-7.36,4,0,38,94.12,228.75540000000007,90.56118696452388,lecithin,0,0,-4.757862141822196,1.8550787802405306,0,0,0,0,0,0,MDB00002517,5338

PCs can also synthesized by the addition of choline to CDP-activated 1,2-diacylglycerol. A third route to PC synthesis involves the conversion of either PS or PE to PC. Plasmalogens are glycerol ether phospholipids. They are of two types, alkyl ether (-O-CH2-) and alkenyl ether (-O-CH=CH-). Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) serves as the glycerol precursor for the synthesis of plasmalogens. Three major classes of plasmalogens have been identified: choline, ethanolamine and serine derivatives. Ethanolamine plasmalogen is prevalent in myelin. Choline plasmalogen is abundant in cardiac tissue. Usually, the highest proportion of the plasmalogen form is in the ethanolamine class with rather less in choline, and commonly little or none in other phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol. In choline plasmalogens of most tissues, a higher proportion is often of the O-alkyl rather than the O-alkenyl form, but the reverse tends to be true in heart lipids. In animal tissues, the alkyl and alkenyl moieties in both non-polar and phospholipids tend to be rather simple in composition with 16:0, 18:0 and 18:1 (double bond in position 9) predominating. Ether analogues of triacylglycerols, i.e. 1-alkyldiacyl-sn-glycerols, are present at trace levels only if at all in most animal tissues, but they can be major components of some marine lipids.'↵",HMDB0008291,CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC(COP([O-])(=O)OCC[N+](C)(C)C)O\C=C/CCCCCCCCCCCCCC,C44H88NO7P,"1S/C44H88NO7P/c1-6-8-10-12-14-16-18-20-22-23-24-25-27-29-31-33-35-37-44(46)50-41-43(42-52-53(47,48)51-40-38-45(3,4)5)49-39-36-34-32-30-28-26-21-19-17-15-13-11-9-7-2/h36,39,43H,6-35,37-38,40-42H2,1-5H3/b39-36-",LULGGIBBAVYIAY-HYLXNHFUSA-N,[2-({2-[(1Z)-hexadec-1-en-1-yloxy]-3-(icosanoyloxy)propyl phosphonato}oxy)ethyl]trimethylazanium,10.284845680194923,,774.1458,773.629840687,1.99e-05 g/l,6.29,-7.62,4,0,43,94.12,234.60760000000005,99.08454727573553,lecithin,0,0,-4.757862141822196,1.8550787802405306,0,0,0,0,0,0,MDB00002583,5237

Plasmalogens are glycerol ether phospholipids. They are of two types, alkyl ether (-O-CH2-) and alkenyl ether (-O-CH=CH-). Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) serves as the glycerol precursor for the synthesis of plasmalogens. Three major classes of plasmalogens have been identified: choline, ethanolamine and serine derivatives. Ethanolamine plasmalogen is prevalent in myelin. Choline plasmalogen is abundant in cardiac tissue. Usually, the highest proportion of the plasmalogen form is in the ethanolamine class with rather less in choline, and commonly little or none in other phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol. In choline plasmalogens of most tissues, a higher proportion is often of the O-alkyl rather than the O-alkenyl form, but the reverse tends to be true in heart lipids. In animal tissues, the alkyl and alkenyl moieties in both non-polar and phospholipids tend to be rather simple in composition with 16:0, 18:0 and 18:1 (double bond in position 9) predominating. Ether analogues of triacylglycerols, i.e. 1-alkyldiacyl-sn-glycerols, are present at trace levels only if at all in most animal tissues, but they can be major components of some marine lipids.'↵",HMDB0008324,CCCCCCCCCCCCCC\C=C/OC(COC(=O)CCCCCCCCC\C=C/CCCCCCCC)COP([O-])(=O)OCC[N+](C)(C)C,C44H86NO7P,"1S/C44H86NO7P/c1-6-8-10-12-14-16-18-20-22-23-24-25-27-29-31-33-35-37-44(46)50-41-43(42-52-53(47,48)51-40-38-45(3,4)5)49-39-36-34-32-30-28-26-21-19-17-15-13-11-9-7-2/h20,22,36,39,43H,6-19,21,23-35,37-38,40-42H2,1-5H3/b22-20-,39-36-",ADZUZWOTJKDMEP-DJRFHFPXSA-N,[2-({2-[(1Z)-hexadec-1-en-1-yloxy]-3-[(11Z)-icos-11-enoyloxy]propyl phosphonato}oxy)ethyl]trimethylazanium,9.922924023528257,,772.1299,771.614190623,2.47e-05 g/l,6.26,-7.52,4,0,42,94.12,235.72420000000005,97.45152168367072,lecithin,0,0,-4.757862141822196,1.8550787802405306,0,0,0,0,0,0,MDB00002616,5236

PCs can also synthesized by the addition of choline to CDP-activated 1,2-diacylglycerol. A third route to PC synthesis involves the conversion of either PS or PE to PC. Plasmalogens are glycerol ether phospholipids. They are of two types, alkyl ether (-O-CH2-) and alkenyl ether (-O-CH=CH-). Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) serves as the glycerol precursor for the synthesis of plasmalogens. Three major classes of plasmalogens have been identified: choline, ethanolamine and serine derivatives. Ethanolamine plasmalogen is prevalent in myelin. Choline plasmalogen is abundant in cardiac tissue. Usually, the highest proportion of the plasmalogen form is in the ethanolamine class with rather less in choline, and commonly little or none in other phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol.

689,"PC(20:2(11Z,14Z)/P-18:1(9Z))","PC(20:2(11Z,14Z)/P-18:1(9Z)) is a phosphatidylcholine (PC or GPCho). It is a glycerophospholipid in which a phosphorylcholine moiety occupies a glycerol substitution site. As is the case with diacylglycerols, glycerophosphocholines can have many different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached at the C-1 and C-2 positions. Fatty acids containing 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. PC(20:2(11Z,14Z)/P-18:1(9Z)), in particular, consists of one chain of eicosadienoic acid at the C-1 position and one chain of plasmalogen 18:1n9 at the C-2 position. The eicosadienoic acid moiety is derived from fish oils and liver, while the plasmalogen 18:1n9 moiety is derived from animal fats, liver and kidney. Phospholipids, are ubiquitous in nature and are key components of the lipid bilayer of cells, as well as being involved in metabolism and signaling. - While most phospholipids have a saturated fatty acid on C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid on C-2 of the glycerol backbone, the fatty acid distribution at the C-1 and C-2 positions of glycerol within phospholipids is continually in flux, owing to phospholipid degradation and the continuous phospholipid remodeling that occurs while these molecules are in membranes. PCs can be synthesized via three different routes. In one route, choline is activated first by phosphorylation and then by coupling to CDP prior to attachment to phosphatidic acid. PCs can also synthesized by the addition of choline to CDP-activated 1,2-diacylglycerol. A third route to PC synthesis involves the conversion of either PS or PE to PC. Plasmalogens are glycerol ether phospholipids. They are of two types, alkyl ether (-O-CH2-) and alkenyl ether (-O-CH=CH-). Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) serves as the glycerol precursor for the synthesis of plasmalogens. Three major classes of plasmalogens have been identified: choline, ethanolamine and serine derivatives. Ethanolamine plasmalogen is prevalent in myelin. Choline plasmalogen is abundant in cardiac tissue. Usually, the highest proportion of the plasmalogen form is in the ethanolamine class with rather less in choline, and commonly little or none in other phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol. In choline plasmalogens of most tissues, a higher proportion is often of the O-alkyl rather than the O-alkenyl form, but the reverse tends to be true in heart lipids. In animal tissues, the alkyl and alkenyl moieties in both non-polar and phospholipids tend to be rather simple in composition with 16:0, 18:0 and 18:1 (double bond in position 9) predominating.

Plasmalogens are glycerol ether phospholipids. They are of two types, alkyl ether (-O-CH2-) and alkenyl ether (-O-CH=CH-). Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) serves as the glycerol precursor for the synthesis of plasmalogens. Three major classes of plasmalogens have been identified: choline, ethanolamine and serine derivatives. Ethanolamine plasmalogen is prevalent in myelin. Choline plasmalogen is abundant in cardiac tissue. Usually, the highest proportion of the plasmalogen form is in the ethanolamine class with rather less in choline, and commonly little or none in other phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol. In choline plasmalogens of most tissues, a higher proportion is often of the O-alkyl rather than the O-alkenyl form, but the reverse tends to be true in heart lipids. In animal tissues, the alkyl and alkenyl moieties in both non-polar and phospholipids tend to be rather simple in composition with 16:0, 18:0 and 18:1 (double bond in position 9) predominating. Ether analogues of triacylglycerols, i.e. 1-alkyldiacyl-sn-glycerols, are present at trace levels only if at all in most animal tissues, but they can be major components of some marine lipids.'↵",HMDB0008391,CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC\C=C/OC(COC(=O)CCC\C=C/C\C=C/C\C=C/CCCCCCCC)COP([O-])(=O)OCC[N+](C)(C)C,C46H86NO7P,"1S/C46H86NO7P/c1-6-8-10-12-14-16-18-20-22-24-25-27-29-31-33-35-37-39-46(48)52-43-45(44-54-55(49,50)53-42-40-47(3,4)5)51-41-38-36-34-32-30-28-26-23-21-19-17-15-13-11-9-7-2/h20,22,25,27,31,33,38,41,45H,6-19,21,23-24,26,28-30,32,34-37,39-40,42-44H2,1-5H3/b22-20-,27-25-,33-31-,41-38-",PLWKPRNKSDXLNG-KZWPABEFSA-N,"[2-({3-[(5Z,8Z,11Z)-icosa-5,8,11-trienoyloxy]-2-[(1Z)-octadec-1-en-1-yloxy]propyl phosphonato}oxy)ethyl]trimethylazanium",10.08821804019492,,796.1513,795.614190623,3.00e-05 g/l,6.48,-7.45,4,0,42,94.12,247.15940000000003,99.78309724640363,lecithin,0,0,-4.757862757927944,1.8550787802403805,0,0,0,0,0,0,MDB00002683,5237

710,"PC(20:3(8Z,11Z,14Z)/P-18:0)","PC(20:3(8Z,11Z,14Z)/P-18:0) is a phosphatidylcholine (PC or GPCho). It is a glycerophospholipid in which a phosphorylcholine moiety occupies a glycerol substitution site. As is the case with diacylglycerols, glycerophosphocholines can have many different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached at the C-1 and C-2 positions. Fatty acids containing 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. PC(20:3(8Z,11Z,14Z)/P-18:0), in particular, consists of one chain of homo-g-linolenic acid at the C-1 position and one chain of plasmalogen 18:0 at the C-2 position. The homo-g-linolenic acid moiety is derived from fish oils, liver and kidney, while the plasmalogen 18:0 moiety is derived from animal fats, liver and kidney. Phospholipids, are ubiquitous in nature and are key components of the lipid bilayer of cells, as well as being involved in metabolism and signaling. - While most phospholipids have a saturated fatty acid on C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid on C-2 of the glycerol backbone, the fatty acid distribution at the C-1 and C-2 positions of glycerol within phospholipids is continually in flux, owing to phospholipid degradation and the continuous phospholipid remodeling that occurs while these molecules are in membranes. PCs can be synthesized via three different routes. In one route, choline is activated first by phosphorylation and then by coupling to CDP prior to attachment to phosphatidic acid. PCs can also synthesized by the addition of choline to CDP-activated 1,2-diacylglycerol. A third route to PC synthesis involves the conversion of either PS or PE to PC. Plasmalogens are glycerol ether phospholipids. They are of two types, alkyl ether (-O-CH2-) and alkenyl ether (-O-CH=CH-). Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) serves as the glycerol precursor for the synthesis of plasmalogens. Three major classes of plasmalogens have been identified: choline, ethanolamine and serine derivatives. Ethanolamine plasmalogen is prevalent in myelin. Choline plasmalogen is abundant in cardiac tissue. Usually, the highest proportion of the plasmalogen form is in the ethanolamine class with rather less in choline, and commonly little or none in other phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol. In choline plasmalogens of most tissues, a higher proportion is often of the O-alkyl rather than the O-alkenyl form, but the reverse tends to be true in heart lipids. In animal tissues, the alkyl and alkenyl moieties in both non-polar and phospholipids tend to be rather simple in composition with 16:0, 18:0 and 18:1 (double bond in position 9) predominating. Ether analogues of triacylglycerols, i.e. 1-alkyldiacyl-sn-glycerols, are present at trace levels only if at all in most animal tissues, but they can be major components of some marine lipids.'↵",HMDB0008423,CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC\C=C/OC(COC(=O)CCCCCC\C=C/C\C=C/C\C=C/CCCCC)COP([O-])(=O)OCC[N+](C)(C)C,C46H86NO7P,"1S/C46H86NO7P/c1-6-8-10-12-14-16-18-20-22-24-25-27-29-31-33-35-37-39-46(48)52-43-45(44-54-55(49,50)53-42-40-47(3,4)5)51-41-38-36-34-32-30-28-26-23-21-19-17-15-13-11-9-7-2/h14,16,20,22,25,27,38,41,45H,6-13,15,17-19,21,23-24,26,28-37,39-40,42-44H2,1-5H3/b16-14-,22-20-,27-25-,41-38-",IMISCMOUPRVKCY-JCOVWSEZSA-N,"[2-({3-[(8Z,11Z,14Z)-icosa-8,11,14-trienoyloxy]-2-[(1Z)-octadec-1-en-1-yloxy]propyl phosphonato}oxy)ethyl]trimethylazanium",10.08821804019492,,796.1513,795.614190623,2.77e-05 g/l,6.44,-7.49,4,0,42,94.12,247.15940000000003,98.96020594127295,lecithin,0,0,-4.757862141822442,1.8550787802405306,0,0,0,0,0,0,MDB00002715,5237

Plasmalogens are glycerol ether phospholipids. They are of two types, alkyl ether (-O-CH2-) and alkenyl ether (-O-CH=CH-). Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) serves as the glycerol precursor for the synthesis of plasmalogens. Three major classes of plasmalogens have been identified: choline, ethanolamine and serine derivatives. Ethanolamine plasmalogen is prevalent in myelin. Choline plasmalogen is abundant in cardiac tissue. Usually, the highest proportion of the plasmalogen form is in the ethanolamine class with rather less in choline, and commonly little or none in other phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol. In choline plasmalogens of most tissues, a higher proportion is often of the O-alkyl rather than the O-alkenyl form, but the reverse tends to be true in heart lipids. In animal tissues, the alkyl and alkenyl moieties in both non-polar and phospholipids tend to be rather simple in composition with 16:0, 18:0 and 18:1 (double bond in position 9) predominating. Ether analogues of triacylglycerols, i.e. 1-alkyldiacyl-sn-glycerols, are present at trace levels only if at all in most animal tissues, but they can be major components of some marine lipids.'↵",HMDB0008653,CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC\C=C/OC(COC(=O)CCCCC\C=C/C\C=C/C\C=C/C\C=C/CCCCC)COP([O-])(=O)OCC[N+](C)(C)C,C48H88NO7P,"1S/C48H88NO7P/c1-6-8-10-12-14-16-18-20-22-24-25-26-27-29-31-33-35-37-39-41-48(50)54-45-47(46-56-57(51,52)55-44-42-49(3,4)5)53-43-40-38-36-34-32-30-28-23-21-19-17-15-13-11-9-7-2/h14,16,20,22,25-26,29,31,40,43,47H,6-13,15,17-19,21,23-24,27-28,30,32-39,41-42,44-46H2,1-5H3/b16-14-,22-20-,26-25-,31-29-,43-40-",HPVYKCPKEVVBSW-DDSLUFNQSA-N,"[2-({3-[(7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z)-docosa-7,10,13,16-tetraenoyloxy]-2-[(1Z)-octadec-1-en-1-yloxy]propyl phosphonato}oxy)ethyl]trimethylazanium",10.615433713528255,,822.1886,821.629840687,3.30e-05 g/l,6.69,-7.42,4,0,43,94.12,257.478,101.85091323531495,lecithin,0,0,-4.757862141895474,1.8550787802405306,0,0,0,0,0,0,MDB00002945,5338

PCs can also synthesized by the addition of choline to CDP-activated 1,2-diacylglycerol. A third route to PC synthesis involves the conversion of either PS or PE to PC. Plasmalogens are glycerol ether phospholipids. They are of two types, alkyl ether (-O-CH2-) and alkenyl ether (-O-CH=CH-). Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) serves as the glycerol precursor for the synthesis of plasmalogens. Three major classes of plasmalogens have been identified: choline, ethanolamine and serine derivatives. Ethanolamine plasmalogen is prevalent in myelin. Choline plasmalogen is abundant in cardiac tissue. Usually, the highest proportion of the plasmalogen form is in the ethanolamine class with rather less in choline, and commonly little or none in other phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol. In choline plasmalogens of most tissues, a higher proportion is often of the O-alkyl rather than the O-alkenyl form, but the reverse tends to be true in heart lipids. In animal tissues, the alkyl and alkenyl moieties in both non-polar and phospholipids tend to be rather simple in composition with 16:0, 18:0 and 18:1 (double bond in position 9) predominating. Ether analogues of triacylglycerols, i.e. 1-alkyldiacyl-sn-glycerols, are present at trace levels only if at all in most animal tissues, but they can be major components of some marine lipids.'↵",HMDB0008818,CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC\C=C/OC(COC(=O)CCCCCCCCCCCCC\C=C/CCCCCCCC)COP([O-])(=O)OCC[N+](C)(C)C,C50H98NO7P,"1S/C50H98NO7P/c1-6-8-10-12-14-16-18-20-22-24-25-26-27-28-29-31-33-35-37-39-41-43-50(52)56-47-49(48-58-59(53,54)57-46-44-51(3,4)5)55-45-42-40-38-36-34-32-30-23-21-19-17-15-13-11-9-7-2/h20,22,42,45,49H,6-19,21,23-41,43-44,46-48H2,1-5H3/b22-20-,45-42-",PGPURMZKEVWAFO-VMNSASLRSA-N,trimethyl[2-({2-[(1Z)-octadec-1-en-1-yloxy]-3-[(15Z)-tetracos-15-enoyloxy]propyl phosphonato}oxy)ethyl]azanium,12.590336013528256,,856.2894,855.708091007,1.86e-05 g/l,6.97,-7.69,4,0,48,94.12,263.33020000000005,110.34919577604677,lecithin,0,0,-4.757862141822196,1.8550787802405306,0,0,0,0,0,0,MDB00003110,5338
794,SM(d18:1/16:0),"Sphingomyelin (d18:1/16:0) or SM(d18:1/16:0) is a sphingomyelin. Sphingomyelin (SM or SPH) is a type of sphingolipid found in animal cell membranes, especially in the membranous myelin sheath which surrounds some nerve cell axons. It usually consists of phosphorylcholine and ceramide. SM(18:1/16:0) consists of oleic acid attached to the C1 position and palmitic acid attached to the C2 position. In humans, sphingomyelin is the only membrane phospholipid not derived from glycerol. Like all sphingolipids, SPH has a ceramide core (sphingosine bonded to a fatty acid via an amide linkage). In addition it contains one polar head group, which is either phosphocholine or phosphoethanolamine. The plasma membrane of cells is highly enriched in sphingomyelin and is considered largely to be found in the exoplasmic leaflet of the cell membrane. However, there is some evidence that there may also be a sphingomyelin pool in the inner leaflet of the membrane. Moreover, neutral sphingomyelinase-2 - an enzyme that breaks down sphingomyelin into ceramide has been found to localise exclusively to the inner leaflet further suggesting that there may be sphingomyelin present there. Sphingomyelin can accumulate in a rare hereditary disease called Niemann-Pick Disease, types A and B. Niemann-Pick disease is a genetically-inherited disease caused by a deficiency in the enzyme Sphingomyelinase, which causes the accumulation of Sphingomyelin in spleen, liver, lungs, bone marrow, and the brain, causing irreversible neurological damage. SMs play a role in signal transduction. - Sphingomyelins are synthesized by the transfer of phosphorylcholine from phosphatidylcholine to a ceramide in a reaction catalyzed by sphingomyelin synthase.↵",HMDB0010169,CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)N[C@@]([H])(COP(O)(=O)OCC[N+](C)(C)C)[C@]([H])(O)\C=C\CCCCCCCCCCCCC,C39H80N2O6P,"1S/C39H79N2O6P/c1-6-8-10-12-14-16-18-20-22-24-26-28-30-32-38(42)37(36-47-48(44,45)46-35-34-41(3,4)5)40-39(43)33-31-29-27-25-23-21-19-17-15-13-11-9-7-2/h30,32,37-38,42H,6-29,31,33-36H2,1-5H3,(H-,40,43,44,45)/p+1/b32-30+/t37-,38+/m0/s1",RWKUXQNLWDTSLO-GWQJGLRPSA-O,"(2-{[(2S,3R,4E)-2-hexadecanamido-3-hydroxyoctadec-4-en-1-yl phosphono]oxy}ethyl)trimethylazanium",6.976057740861588,13.49920132064026,704.0361,703.575399814,3.27e-05 g/l,5.12,-7.36,4,2,36,107.92000000000002,213.94190000000006,88.7622979070575,"(2-{[(2S,3R,4E)-2-hexadecanamido-3-hydroxyoctadec-4-en-1-yl phosphono]oxy}ethyl)trimethylazanium",0,0,-1.050204146041731,1.865155035270682,0,0,0,0,0,0,MDB00004213,5236

As is the case with diacylglycerols, glycerophosphocholines can have many different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached at the C-1 and C-2 positions. Fatty acids containing 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. PC(P-16:0/18:1(11Z)), in particular, consists of one chain of plasmalogen 16:0 at the C-1 position and one chain of vaccenic acid at the C-2 position. The plasmalogen 16:0 moiety is derived from animal fats, liver and kidney, while the vaccenic acid moiety is derived from butter fat and animal fat. Phospholipids, are ubiquitous in nature and are key components of the lipid bilayer of cells, as well as being involved in metabolism and signaling. - While most phospholipids have a saturated fatty acid on C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid on C-2 of the glycerol backbone, the fatty acid distribution at the C-1 and C-2 positions of glycerol within phospholipids is continually in flux, owing to phospholipid degradation and the continuous phospholipid remodeling that occurs while these molecules are in membranes. PCs can be synthesized via three different routes. In one route, choline is activated first by phosphorylation and then by coupling to CDP prior to attachment to phosphatidic acid. PCs can also synthesized by the addition of choline to CDP-activated 1,2-diacylglycerol. A third route to PC synthesis involves the conversion of either PS or PE to PC. Plasmalogens are glycerol ether phospholipids. They are of two types, alkyl ether (-O-CH2-) and alkenyl ether (-O-CH=CH-). Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) serves as the glycerol precursor for the synthesis of plasmalogens. Three major classes of plasmalogens have been identified: choline, ethanolamine and serine derivatives. Ethanolamine plasmalogen is prevalent in myelin. Choline plasmalogen is abundant in cardiac tissue. Usually, the highest proportion of the plasmalogen form is in the ethanolamine class with rather less in choline, and commonly little or none in other phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol.

Three major classes of plasmalogens have been identified: choline, ethanolamine and serine derivatives. Ethanolamine plasmalogen is prevalent in myelin. Choline plasmalogen is abundant in cardiac tissue. Usually, the highest proportion of the plasmalogen form is in the ethanolamine class with rather less in choline, and commonly little or none in other phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol. In choline plasmalogens of most tissues, a higher proportion is often of the O-alkyl rather than the O-alkenyl form, but the reverse tends to be true in heart lipids. In animal tissues, the alkyl and alkenyl moieties in both non-polar and phospholipids tend to be rather simple in composition with 16:0, 18:0 and 18:1 (double bond in position 9) predominating. Ether analogues of triacylglycerols, i.e. 1-alkyldiacyl-sn-glycerols, are present at trace levels only if at all in most animal tissues, but they can be major components of some marine lipids.' - Phosphatidylcholines are a class of phospholipids which incorporate choline as a headgroup. They are a major component of biological membranes and can be isolated from either egg yolk (in Greek lekithos) or soy beans from which they are mechanically extracted or chemically extracted using hexane. - Phosphatidylcholines are such a major component of lecithin, that, in some contexts, the terms are sometime used as synonyms. However, lecithin extract consists of a mixture of phosphatidylcholine and other compounds. It is also used along with sodium taurocholate for simulating fed- and fasted-state biorelevant media in dissolution studies of highly-lipophilic drugs. Phosphatidylcholine is a major constituent of cell membranes, and also plays a role in membrane-mediated cell signalling. - Phospholipase D catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine to form phosphatidic acid (PA), releasing the soluble choline headgroup into the cytosol. - Some medical researchers are experimenting with using Phosphatidylcholine in a type of injection that will break down fat cells; to be used as an alternative to liposuction known as Injection lipolysis. (Wikipedia) - While most phospholipids have a saturated fatty acid on C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid on C-2 of the glycerol backbone, the fatty acid distribution at the C-1 and C-2 positions of glycerol within phospholipids is continually in flux, owing to phospholipid degradation and the continuous phospholipid remodeling that occurs while these molecules are in membranes. PCs can be synthesized via three different routes. In one route, choline is activated first by phosphorylation and then by coupling to CDP prior to attachment to phosphatidic acid. PCs can also synthesized by the addition of choline to CDP-activated 1,2-diacylglycerol. A third route to PC synthesis involves the conversion of either PS or PE to PC.

818,PC(P-18:0/18:0),"PC(P-18:0/18:0) is a phosphatidylcholine (PC or GPCho). It is a glycerophospholipid in which a phosphorylcholine moiety occupies a glycerol substitution site. As is the case with diacylglycerols, glycerophosphocholines can have many different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached at the C-1 and C-2 positions. Fatty acids containing 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. PC(P-18:0/18:0), in particular, consists of one chain of plasmalogen 18:0 at the C-1 position and one chain of stearic acid at the C-2 position. The plasmalogen 18:0 moiety is derived from animal fats, liver and kidney, while the stearic acid moiety is derived from animal fats, coco butter and sesame oil. Phospholipids, are ubiquitous in nature and are key components of the lipid bilayer of cells, as well as being involved in metabolism and signaling. - While most phospholipids have a saturated fatty acid on C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid on C-2 of the glycerol backbone, the fatty acid distribution at the C-1 and C-2 positions of glycerol within phospholipids is continually in flux, owing to phospholipid degradation and the continuous phospholipid remodeling that occurs while these molecules are in membranes. PCs can be synthesized via three different routes. In one route, choline is activated first by phosphorylation and then by coupling to CDP prior to attachment to phosphatidic acid. PCs can also synthesized by the addition of choline to CDP-activated 1,2-diacylglycerol. A third route to PC synthesis involves the conversion of either PS or PE to PC. Plasmalogens are glycerol ether phospholipids. They are of two types, alkyl ether (-O-CH2-) and alkenyl ether (-O-CH=CH-). Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) serves as the glycerol precursor for the synthesis of plasmalogens. Three major classes of plasmalogens have been identified: choline, ethanolamine and serine derivatives. Ethanolamine plasmalogen is prevalent in myelin. Choline plasmalogen is abundant in cardiac tissue. Usually, the highest proportion of the plasmalogen form is in the ethanolamine class with rather less in choline, and commonly little or none in other phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol.

Fatty acids containing 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. PC(P-18:0/22:6(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)), in particular, consists of one chain of plasmalogen 18:0 at the C-1 position and one chain of docosahexaenoic acid at the C-2 position. The plasmalogen 18:0 moiety is derived from animal fats, liver and kidney, while the docosahexaenoic acid moiety is derived from fish oils. Phospholipids, are ubiquitous in nature and are key components of the lipid bilayer of cells, as well as being involved in metabolism and signaling. - While most phospholipids have a saturated fatty acid on C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid on C-2 of the glycerol backbone, the fatty acid distribution at the C-1 and C-2 positions of glycerol within phospholipids is continually in flux, owing to phospholipid degradation and the continuous phospholipid remodeling that occurs while these molecules are in membranes. PCs can be synthesized via three different routes. In one route, choline is activated first by phosphorylation and then by coupling to CDP prior to attachment to phosphatidic acid. PCs can also synthesized by the addition of choline to CDP-activated 1,2-diacylglycerol. A third route to PC synthesis involves the conversion of either PS or PE to PC. Plasmalogens are glycerol ether phospholipids. They are of two types, alkyl ether (-O-CH2-) and alkenyl ether (-O-CH=CH-). Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) serves as the glycerol precursor for the synthesis of plasmalogens.

The plasmalogen 18:1n7 moiety is derived from animal fats, liver and kidney, while the palmitic acid moiety is derived from fish oils, milk fats, vegetable oils and animal fats. Phospholipids, are ubiquitous in nature and are key components of the lipid bilayer of cells, as well as being involved in metabolism and signaling. - While most phospholipids have a saturated fatty acid on C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid on C-2 of the glycerol backbone, the fatty acid distribution at the C-1 and C-2 positions of glycerol within phospholipids is continually in flux, owing to phospholipid degradation and the continuous phospholipid remodeling that occurs while these molecules are in membranes. PCs can be synthesized via three different routes. In one route, choline is activated first by phosphorylation and then by coupling to CDP prior to attachment to phosphatidic acid. PCs can also synthesized by the addition of choline to CDP-activated 1,2-diacylglycerol. A third route to PC synthesis involves the conversion of either PS or PE to PC. Plasmalogens are glycerol ether phospholipids. They are of two types, alkyl ether (-O-CH2-) and alkenyl ether (-O-CH=CH-). Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) serves as the glycerol precursor for the synthesis of plasmalogens. Three major classes of plasmalogens have been identified: choline, ethanolamine and serine derivatives. Ethanolamine plasmalogen is prevalent in myelin. Choline plasmalogen is abundant in cardiac tissue. Usually, the highest proportion of the plasmalogen form is in the ethanolamine class with rather less in choline, and commonly little or none in other phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol. In choline plasmalogens of most tissues, a higher proportion is often of the O-alkyl rather than the O-alkenyl form, but the reverse tends to be true in heart lipids. In animal tissues, the alkyl and alkenyl moieties in both non-polar and phospholipids tend to be rather simple in composition with 16:0, 18:0 and 18:1 (double bond in position 9) predominating. Ether analogues of triacylglycerols, i.e. 1-alkyldiacyl-sn-glycerols, are present at trace levels only if at all in most animal tissues, but they can be major components of some marine lipids.'↵",HMDB0011272,CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC(CO\C=C/CCCCCCCC\C=C/CCCCCC)COP([O-])(=O)OCC[N+](C)(C)C,C42H82NO7P,"1S/C42H82NO7P/c1-6-8-10-12-14-16-18-20-21-22-24-26-28-30-32-34-37-47-39-41(40-49-51(45,46)48-38-36-43(3,4)5)50-42(44)35-33-31-29-27-25-23-19-17-15-13-11-9-7-2/h16,18,34,37,41H,6-15,17,19-33,35-36,38-40H2,1-5H3/b18-16-,37-34-",MBRHHFWRXQYYAN-RTVLTNFHSA-N,"(2-{[2-(hexadecanoyloxy)-3-[(1Z,11Z)-octadeca-1,11-dien-1-yloxy]propyl phosphonato]oxy}ethyl)trimethylazanium",9.033786693528256,,744.0767,743.582890495,2.36e-05 g/l,5.96,-7.53,4,0,40,94.12,226.52220000000005,92.6630699355372,"(2-{[2-(hexadecanoyloxy)-3-[(1Z,11Z)-octadeca-1,11-dien-1-yloxy]propyl phosphonato]oxy}ethyl)trimethylazanium",0,0,-4.731743075587598,1.8550574852835355,0,0,0,0,0,0,MDB00004609,5236

It is a glycerophospholipid in which a phosphorylcholine moiety occupies a glycerol substitution site. As is the case with diacylglycerols, glycerophosphocholines can have many different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached at the C-1 and C-2 positions. Fatty acids containing 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. PC(P-18:1(11Z)/22:5(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z)), in particular, consists of one chain of plasmalogen 18:1n7 at the C-1 position and one chain of docosapentaenoic acid at the C-2 position. The plasmalogen 18:1n7 moiety is derived from animal fats, liver and kidney, while the docosapentaenoic acid moiety is derived from animal fats and brain. Phospholipids, are ubiquitous in nature and are key components of the lipid bilayer of cells, as well as being involved in metabolism and signaling. - While most phospholipids have a saturated fatty acid on C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid on C-2 of the glycerol backbone, the fatty acid distribution at the C-1 and C-2 positions of glycerol within phospholipids is continually in flux, owing to phospholipid degradation and the continuous phospholipid remodeling that occurs while these molecules are in membranes. PCs can be synthesized via three different routes. In one route, choline is activated first by phosphorylation and then by coupling to CDP prior to attachment to phosphatidic acid. PCs can also synthesized by the addition of choline to CDP-activated 1,2-diacylglycerol. A third route to PC synthesis involves the conversion of either PS or PE to PC. Plasmalogens are glycerol ether phospholipids. They are of two types, alkyl ether (-O-CH2-) and alkenyl ether (-O-CH=CH-). Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) serves as the glycerol precursor for the synthesis of plasmalogens. Three major classes of plasmalogens have been identified: choline, ethanolamine and serine derivatives. Ethanolamine plasmalogen is prevalent in myelin. Choline plasmalogen is abundant in cardiac tissue. Usually, the highest proportion of the plasmalogen form is in the ethanolamine class with rather less in choline, and commonly little or none in other phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol.

840,PC(P-18:1(9Z)/16:0),"PC(P-18:1(9Z)/16:0) is a phosphatidylcholine (PC or GPCho). It is a glycerophospholipid in which a phosphorylcholine moiety occupies a glycerol substitution site. As is the case with diacylglycerols, glycerophosphocholines can have many different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached at the C-1 and C-2 positions. Fatty acids containing 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. PC(P-18:1(9Z)/16:0), in particular, consists of one chain of plasmalogen 18:1n9 at the C-1 position and one chain of palmitic acid at the C-2 position. The plasmalogen 18:1n9 moiety is derived from animal fats, liver and kidney, while the palmitic acid moiety is derived from fish oils, milk fats, vegetable oils and animal fats. Phospholipids, are ubiquitous in nature and are key components of the lipid bilayer of cells, as well as being involved in metabolism and signaling. - While most phospholipids have a saturated fatty acid on C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid on C-2 of the glycerol backbone, the fatty acid distribution at the C-1 and C-2 positions of glycerol within phospholipids is continually in flux, owing to phospholipid degradation and the continuous phospholipid remodeling that occurs while these molecules are in membranes. PCs can be synthesized via three different routes. In one route, choline is activated first by phosphorylation and then by coupling to CDP prior to attachment to phosphatidic acid. PCs can also synthesized by the addition of choline to CDP-activated 1,2-diacylglycerol. A third route to PC synthesis involves the conversion of either PS or PE to PC. Plasmalogens are glycerol ether phospholipids. They are of two types, alkyl ether (-O-CH2-) and alkenyl ether (-O-CH=CH-). Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) serves as the glycerol precursor for the synthesis of plasmalogens. Three major classes of plasmalogens have been identified: choline, ethanolamine and serine derivatives. Ethanolamine plasmalogen is prevalent in myelin. Choline plasmalogen is abundant in cardiac tissue. Usually, the highest proportion of the plasmalogen form is in the ethanolamine class with rather less in choline, and commonly little or none in other phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol. In choline plasmalogens of most tissues, a higher proportion is often of the O-alkyl rather than the O-alkenyl form, but the reverse tends to be true in heart lipids.

PCs can also synthesized by the addition of choline to CDP-activated 1,2-diacylglycerol. A third route to PC synthesis involves the conversion of either PS or PE to PC. Plasmalogens are glycerol ether phospholipids. They are of two types, alkyl ether (-O-CH2-) and alkenyl ether (-O-CH=CH-). Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) serves as the glycerol precursor for the synthesis of plasmalogens. Three major classes of plasmalogens have been identified: choline, ethanolamine and serine derivatives. Ethanolamine plasmalogen is prevalent in myelin. Choline plasmalogen is abundant in cardiac tissue. Usually, the highest proportion of the plasmalogen form is in the ethanolamine class with rather less in choline, and commonly little or none in other phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol. In choline plasmalogens of most tissues, a higher proportion is often of the O-alkyl rather than the O-alkenyl form, but the reverse tends to be true in heart lipids. In animal tissues, the alkyl and alkenyl moieties in both non-polar and phospholipids tend to be rather simple in composition with 16:0, 18:0 and 18:1 (double bond in position 9) predominating. Ether analogues of triacylglycerols, i.e. 1-alkyldiacyl-sn-glycerols, are present at trace levels only if at all in most animal tissues, but they can be major components of some marine lipids.'↵",HMDB0011321,CCCCCCCC\C=C/CCCCCC\C=C/OCC(COP([O-])(=O)OCC[N+](C)(C)C)OC(=O)CCC\C=C/C\C=C/C\C=C/C\C=C/C\C=C/CC,C46H80NO7P,"1S/C46H80NO7P/c1-6-8-10-12-14-16-18-20-22-24-25-27-29-31-33-35-37-39-46(48)54-45(44-53-55(49,50)52-42-40-47(3,4)5)43-51-41-38-36-34-32-30-28-26-23-21-19-17-15-13-11-9-7-2/h8,10,14,16,20-23,25,27,31,33,38,41,45H,6-7,9,11-13,15,17-19,24,26,28-30,32,34-37,39-40,42-44H2,1-5H3/b10-8-,16-14-,22-20-,23-21-,27-25-,33-31-,41-38-",ZODCGHWSTRZXKA-HALYXBRLSA-N,"[2-({2-[(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)-icosa-5,8,11,14,17-pentaenoyloxy]-3-[(1Z,9Z)-octadeca-1,9-dien-1-yloxy]propyl phosphonato}oxy)ethyl]trimethylazanium",9.00245307019492,,790.1037,789.567240431,3.96e-05 g/l,6.11,-7.33,4,0,39,94.12,250.50920000000008,94.05280002172493,"[2-({2-[(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)-icosa-5,8,11,14,17-pentaenoyloxy]-3-[(1Z,9Z)-octadeca-1,9-dien-1-yloxy]propyl phosphonato}oxy)ethyl]trimethylazanium",0,0,-4.731743638602922,1.8550574852833202,0,0,0,0,0,0,MDB00004654,"5236,5338"

853,SM(d18:1/24:1(15Z)),"Sphingomyelin (d18:1/24:1(15Z)) or SM(d18:1/24:1(15Z)) is a type of sphingolipid found in animal cell membranes, especially in the membranous myelin sheath which surrounds some nerve cell axons. It usually consists of phosphorylcholine and ceramide. In humans, sphingomyelin is the only membrane phospholipid not derived from glycerol. Like all sphingolipids, SPH has a ceramide core (sphingosine bonded to a fatty acid via an amide linkage). In addition it contains one polar head group, which is either phosphocholine or phosphoethanolamine. The plasma membrane of cells is highly enriched in sphingomyelin and is considered largely to be found in the exoplasmic leaflet of the cell membrane. However, there is some evidence that there may also be a sphingomyelin pool in the inner leaflet of the membrane. Moreover, neutral sphingomyelinase-2 - an enzyme that breaks down sphingomyelin into ceramide has been found to localise exclusively to the inner leaflet further suggesting that there may be sphingomyelin present there. Sphingomyelin can accumulate in a rare hereditary disease called Niemann-Pick Disease, types A and B. Niemann-Pick disease is a genetically-inherited disease caused by a deficiency in the enzyme Sphingomyelinase, which causes the accumulation of Sphingomyelin in spleen, liver, lungs, bone marrow, and the brain, causing irreversible neurological damage. SMs play a role in signal transduction. - Sphingomyelins are synthesized by the transfer of phosphorylcholine from phosphatidylcholine to a ceramide in a reaction catalyzed by sphingomyelin synthase.↵",HMDB0012107,CCCCCCCCCCCCC\C=C\[C@@H](O)[C@H](COP([O-])(=O)OCC[N+](C)(C)C)NC(=O)CCCCCCCCCCCCC\C=C/CCCCCCCC,C47H93N2O6P,"1S/C47H93N2O6P/c1-6-8-10-12-14-16-18-20-21-22-23-24-25-26-27-29-31-33-35-37-39-41-47(51)48-45(44-55-56(52,53)54-43-42-49(3,4)5)46(50)40-38-36-34-32-30-28-19-17-15-13-11-9-7-2/h20-21,38,40,45-46,50H,6-19,22-37,39,41-44H2,1-5H3,(H-,48,51,52,53)/b21-20-,40-38+/t45-,46+/m0/s1",WKZHECFHXLTOLJ-QYKFWSDSSA-N,"(2-{[(2S,3R,4E)-3-hydroxy-2-[(15Z)-tetracos-15-enamido]octadec-4-en-1-yl phosphonato]oxy}ethyl)trimethylazanium",11.260029499528411,13.499201320641198,813.2249,812.67712523,2.73e-05 g/l,6.30,-7.50,4,2,43,107.92000000000002,251.86650000000003,103.75022392559721,C24:1 sphingomyelin,0,0,0.011796153944252485,1.8709150288593719,0,0,0,0,0,0,MDB00004839,5236
854,LysoPC(17:0),"LysoPC(17:0) is a lysophospholipid (LyP). It is a monoglycerophospholipid in which a phosphorylcholine moiety occupies a glycerol substitution site. Lysophosphatidylcholines can have different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached at the C-1 (sn-1) position. Fatty acids containing 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. LysoPC(17:0), in particular, consists of one chain of margaric acid at the C-1 position. The margaric acid moiety is derived from butter, milk and fat of ruminants. Lysophosphatidylcholine is found in small amounts in most tissues. It is formed by hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine by the enzyme phospholipase A2, as part of the de-acylation/re-acylation cycle that controls its overall molecular species composition. It can also be formed inadvertently during extraction of lipids from tissues if the phospholipase is activated by careless handling. In blood plasma significant amounts of lysophosphatidylcholine are formed by a specific enzyme system, lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), which is secreted from the liver. The enzyme catalyzes the transfer of the fatty acids of position sn-2 of phosphatidylcholine to the free cholesterol in plasma, with formation of cholesterol esters and lysophosphatidylcholine. Lysophospholipids have a role in lipid signaling by acting on lysophospholipid receptors (LPL-R). LPL-R's are members of the G protein-coupled receptor family of integral membrane proteins.↵",HMDB0012108,[H][C@@](O)(COC(=O)CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC)COP([O-])(=O)OCC[N+](C)(C)C,C25H52NO7P,"1S/C25H52NO7P/c1-5-6-7-8-9-10-11-12-13-14-15-16-17-18-19-25(28)31-22-24(27)23-33-34(29,30)32-21-20-26(2,3)4/h24,27H,5-23H2,1-4H3/t24-/m1/s1",SRRQPVVYXBTRQK-XMMPIXPASA-N,(2-{[(2R)-3-(heptadecanoyloxy)-2-hydroxypropyl phosphono]oxy}ethyl)trimethylazanium,1.6373111418615869,13.655609236411614,509.6566,509.348139535,2.89e-04 g/l,2.18,-6.29,4,1,25,105.11999999999999,146.87470000000005,60.01913178181053,(2-{[(2R)-3-(heptadecanoyloxy)-2-hydroxypropyl phosphono]oxy}ethyl)trimethylazanium,0,0,-3.4040033707844772,1.8553406136270887,0,0,0,0,0,0,MDB00004840,5338

876,SM(d18:0/14:1(9Z)(OH)),"Sphingomyelin (d18:0/14:1(9Z)(OH)) or SM(d18:0/14:1(9Z)(OH)) is a type of sphingolipid found in animal cell membranes, especially in the membranous myelin sheath which surrounds some nerve cell axons. It usually consists of phosphorylcholine and ceramide. In humans, sphingomyelin is the only membrane phospholipid not derived from glycerol. Like all sphingolipids, SPH has a ceramide core (sphingosine bonded to a fatty acid via an amide linkage). In addition it contains one polar head group, which is either phosphocholine or phosphoethanolamine. The plasma membrane of cells is highly enriched in sphingomyelin and is considered largely to be found in the exoplasmic leaflet of the cell membrane. However, there is some evidence that there may also be a sphingomyelin pool in the inner leaflet of the membrane. Moreover, neutral sphingomyelinase-2 - an enzyme that breaks down sphingomyelin into ceramide has been found to localise exclusively to the inner leaflet further suggesting that there may be sphingomyelin present there. Sphingomyelin can accumulate in a rare hereditary disease called Niemann-Pick Disease, types A and B. Niemann-Pick disease is a genetically-inherited disease caused by a deficiency in the enzyme Sphingomyelinase, which causes the accumulation of Sphingomyelin in spleen, liver, lungs, bone marrow, and the brain, causing irreversible neurological damage. SMs play a role in signal transduction. - Sphingomyelins are synthesized by the transfer of phosphorylcholine from phosphatidylcholine to a ceramide in a reaction catalyzed by sphingomyelin synthase.↵",HMDB0013462,CCCCCCCCCCCCC\C=C\[C@@H](O)[C@H](COP([O-])(=O)OCC[N+](C)(C)C)NC(=O)CC(O)CCCCC\C=C/CCCC,C37H73N2O7P,"1S/C37H73N2O7P/c1-6-8-10-12-14-16-17-18-19-21-23-25-27-29-36(41)35(33-46-47(43,44)45-31-30-39(3,4)5)38-37(42)32-34(40)28-26-24-22-20-15-13-11-9-7-2/h13,15,27,29,34-36,40-41H,6-12,14,16-26,28,30-33H2,1-5H3,(H-,38,42,43,44)/b15-13-,29-27+/t34?,35-,36+/m0/s1",ZNHNJXWKKQKMBU-POWUNZFVSA-N,"(2-{[(2S,3R,4E)-3-hydroxy-2-[(9Z)-3-hydroxytetradec-9-enamido]octadec-4-en-1-yl phosphono]oxy}ethyl)trimethylazanium",4.494187687194921,13.386107316070731,688.9585,688.515539212,5.96e-05 g/l,3.91,-7.10,5,3,33,128.14999999999998,207.37200000000004,82.80903036363584,"(2-{[(2S,3R,4E)-3-hydroxy-2-[(9Z)-3-hydroxytetradec-9-enamido]octadec-4-en-1-yl phosphono]oxy}ethyl)trimethylazanium",0,0,-1.5374968164983756,1.864788889978064,0,0,0,0,0,0,MDB00004957,5236
877,SM(d18:0/22:1(13Z)(OH)),"Sphingomyelin (d18:0/22:1(13Z)(OH)) or SM(d18:0/22:1(13Z)(OH)) is a type of sphingolipid found in animal cell membranes, especially in the membranous myelin sheath which surrounds some nerve cell axons. It usually consists of phosphorylcholine and ceramide. In humans, sphingomyelin is the only membrane phospholipid not derived from glycerol. Like all sphingolipids, SPH has a ceramide core (sphingosine bonded to a fatty acid via an amide linkage). In addition it contains one polar head group, which is either phosphocholine or phosphoethanolamine. The plasma membrane of cells is highly enriched in sphingomyelin and is considered largely to be found in the exoplasmic leaflet of the cell membrane. However, there is some evidence that there may also be a sphingomyelin pool in the inner leaflet of the membrane. Moreover, neutral sphingomyelinase-2 - an enzyme that breaks down sphingomyelin into ceramide has been found to localise exclusively to the inner leaflet further suggesting that there may be sphingomyelin present there. Sphingomyelin can accumulate in a rare hereditary disease called Niemann-Pick Disease, types A and B.
