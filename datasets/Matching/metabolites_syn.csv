It is classified as a member of the 21-hydroxysteroids. 21-hydroxysteroids are steroids carrying a hydroxyl group at the 21-position of the steroid backbone. Deoxycorticosterone is very hydrophobic, practically insoluble (in water), and relatively neutral. Deoxycorticosterone can be synthesized from progesterone by 21-beta-hydroxylase and is then converted to corticosterone by 11-beta-hydroxylase. Corticosterone is then converted to aldosterone by aldosterone synthase. Deoxycorticosterone stimulates the collecting tubules in the kidney to continue to excrete potassium in much the same way that aldosterone does. Deoxycorticosterone has about 1/20 of the sodium retaining power of aldosterone and about 1/5 the potassium excreting power of aldosterone (Wikipedia). Deoxycorticosterone can be found throughout all human tissues and has been detected in amniotic fluid and blood. When present in sufficiently high levels, deoxycorticosterone can act as a hypertensive agent and a metabotoxin. A hypertensive agent increases blood pressure and causes the production of more urine. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels.  Chronically high levels of deoxycorticosterone are associated with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) and with adrenal tumors producing deoxycorticosterone (PMID: 20671982). High levels of this mineralocorticoid are associated with resistant hypertension, which can result in polyuria, polydipsia, increased blood volume, edema, and cardiac enlargement. Deoxycorticosterone can be used to treat adrenal insufficiency. In particular, desoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) is used as replacement therapy in Addison's disease.",Deoxycorticosterone,HMDB0000016,,,C03205,11-DEOXYCORTICOSTERONE,FDB021873,11docrtstrn,[H]OC([H])([H])C(=O)[C@@]1([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])[C@@]2([H])[C@]3([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C4=C([H])C(=O)C([H])([H])C([H])([H])[C@]4(C([H])([H])[H])[C@@]3([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])[C@]12C([H])([H])[H],"21-Hydroxy-4-pregnene-3,20-dione***21-Hydroxyprogesterone***4-Pregnen-21-ol-3,20-dione***Cortexone***DESOXYCORTICOSTERONE***Desoxycortone***DOC***Kendall's desoxy compound b***Reichstein's substance Q***11-Dehydroxycorticosterone***11-Deoxy-corticosterone***11-Deoxycorticosterone***11-Desoxycorticosterone***21-Hydroxy-3,20-dioxopregn-4-ene***21-Hydroxy-D4-pregnane-3,20-dione***21-Hydroxy-D4-pregnene-3,20-dione***21-Hydroxy-pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione***21-Hydroxy-progesterone***21-Hydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione***D4-Pregnene-21-ol-3,20-dione***Deoxycortone***Doca***11-Decorticosterone***21 Hydroxyprogesterone***11 Decorticosterone***21 Hydroxy 4 pregnene 3,20 dione",ZESRJSPZRDMNHY-YFWFAHHUSA-N,"InChI=1S/C21H30O3/c1-20-9-7-14(23)11-13(20)3-4-15-16-5-6-18(19(24)12-22)21(16,2)10-8-17(15)20/h11,15-18,22H,3-10,12H2,1-2H3/t15-,16-,17-,18+,20-,21-/m0/s1"

PEG is also known as polyethylene oxide (PEO) or polyoxyethylene (POE), depending on its molecular weight. PEG, PEO, or POE refers to an oligomer or polymer of ethylene oxide. Polyethylene glycol is produced by the interaction of ethylene oxide with water, ethylene glycol, or ethylene glycol oligomers. PEG is the basis of a number of laxatives (e.g. macrogol-containing products such as Movicol and polyethylene glycol 3350, or SoftLax, MiraLAX, or GlycoLax). Whole bowel irrigation with polyethylene glycol and added electrolytes is used for bowel preparation before surgery or colonoscopy. PEG is used as an excipient in many pharmaceutical products. Lower-molecular-weight variants are used as solvents in oral liquids and soft capsules, whereas solid variants are used as ointment bases, tablet binders, film coatings, and lubricants (Wikipedia). It has been shown that polyethylene glycol can improve healing of spinal injuries in dogs. Earlier findings that polyethylene glycol can aid in nerve repair came from the University of Texas (Krause and Bittner). Polyethylene glycol is commonly used to fuse B-cells with myeloma cells in monoclonal antibody production. PEG has recently been proven to give better results in constipation patients than tegaserod. Since PEG is a flexible, water-soluble polymer, it can be used to create very high osmotic pressures (tens of atmospheres). It also is unlikely to have specific interactions with biological chemicals. These properties make PEG one of the most useful molecules for applying osmotic pressure in biochemistry experiments, particularly when using the osmotic stress technique. Polyethylene glycol has been shown to exhibit excitant, anesthetic, radical scavenger, anti-microbial, and laxative functions (PMID: 10726226, 9485637, 11179847, 19089178, 20011352).","1,2-Ethanediol",HMDB0037790,,,,,,,,,,

LO product 12-HETE is associated with pathogenesis of hypertension, and may mediate angiotensin II and TGFbeta induced mesengial cell abnormality in diabetic nephropathy. 12-HETE is markedly elevated in the psoriatic lesions. 12-HETE is a vasoconstrictor eicosanoid that contribute to high blood pressure in (renovascular) hypertension and pregnancy-induced hypertension. A significant percentage of patients suffering from a selective increase in plasma LDL cholesterol (type IIa hyperlipoproteinaemia) exhibits increased platelet reactivity. This includes enhanced platelet responsiveness against a variety of platelet-stimulating agents ex vivo and enhanced arachidonic acid metabolism associated with increased generation of arachidonic acid metabolites such as 12-HETE, and secretion of platelet-storage products (PMID: 7562532, 12480795, 17361113, 8498970,1333255, 2119633). 12-HETE is a highly selective ligand used to label mu-opioid receptors in both membranes and tissue sections. The 12-s-HETE analog has been reported to augment tumour cell metastatic potential through activation of protein kinase c. 12-HETE can be formed either in the 12-S or 12-R configuration. It has a diversity of biological actions and is generated by a number of tissues including the renal glomerulus and the vasculature. 12-HETE is one of the six monohydroxy fatty acids produced by the non-enzymatic oxidation of arachidonic acid. 12-HETE is a neuromodulator that is synthesized during ischemia. Its neuronal effects include attenuation of calcium influx and glutamate release as well as inhibition of AMPA receptor (AMPA-R) activation. 12-HETE is found to be associated with peroxisomal biogenesis defect and Zellweger syndrome, which are inborn errors of metabolism.",12-HETE,HMDB0006111,,,,,FDB001435,12harachd,[H]OC([H])(C(\[H])=C(\[H])/C(/[H])=C(/[H])C([H])([H])C(\[H])=C(/[H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([O-])=O)C([H])([H])C(\[H])=C(\[H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])[H],"(e,Z,Z,Z)-12-Hydroxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoate***(e,Z,Z,Z)-12-Hydroxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid***12-Hydroxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoate***12-Hydroxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid***12-Hydroxy-5E,8Z,10Z,14Z-eicosatetraenoate***12-Hydroxy-5E,8Z,10Z,14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid***12-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoate***12-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid***12-R-HETE***12 S Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid***12-S-HETE***Acid, 12-S-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic***12-S-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid",ZNHVWPKMFKADKW-FUOBAMOMSA-M,"InChI=1S/C20H32O3/c1-2-3-4-5-10-13-16-19(21)17-14-11-8-6-7-9-12-15-18-20(22)23/h7-11,13-14,17,19,21H,2-6,12,15-16,18H2,1H3,(H,22,23)/p-1/b9-7+,11-8?,13-10-,17-14?"

12ppd_R,57-55-6,16997,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Propylene glycol (1,2-propanediol) is an organic compound (a diol alcohol), usually a tasteless, odorless, and colorless clear oily liquid that is hygroscopic and miscible with water, acetone, and chloroform. It is manufactured by the hydration of propylene oxide. Propylene glycol is used as a solvent for intravenous, oral, and topical pharmaceutical preparations It is generally considered safe. However in large doses it can be toxic, especially if given over a short period of time. Intravenous lorazepam contains the largest amount of propylene glycol of commonly used drugs. In adults with normal liver and kidney function, the terminal half-life of propylene glycol ranges from 1.4 to 3.3 hours. Propylene glycol is metabolized by the liver to form lactate, acetate, and pyruvate. The nonmetabolized drug is excreted in the urine mainly as the glucuronide conjugate, approximately 12 to 45 percent is excreted unchanged in urine. Renal clearance decreases as the dose administered increases (390 ml/minute/173 m2 at a dose of 5 g/day but only 144 ml/minute/173 m2 at a dose of 21 g/day). These data suggest that renal clearance declines at higher propylene glycol doses because of saturation of proximal tubular secretion of the drug. As an acceptable level of propylene glycol has not been defined, the clinical implication of a propylene glycol level is unclear. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a maximum consumption of 25 mg/kg/day (1.8 g/day for a 75 kg male) of propylene glycol when used as a food additive, but this limit does not address its use as a drug solvent. No maximum dose is recommended in the literature for intravenous therapy with propylene glycol. Intoxication occurs at much higher doses than the WHO dose limit and is exclusive to pharmacologic exposure. Propylene glycol toxicity includes development of serum hyperosmolality, lactic acidosis, and kidney failure. It has been suggested that proximal tubular necrosis is the cause of acute kidney injury from propylene glycol. Along these lines, proximal tubular cell injury occurs in cultured human cells exposed to propylene glycol. Acute tubular necrosis was described with propylene glycol toxicity in a case of concomitant administration of intravenous lorazepam and trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole. Propylene glycol induced intoxication can also mimic sepsis or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Patients suspected of having sepsis with negative cultures should be evaluated for propylene glycol toxicity if they have been exposed to high dose lorazepam or other medications containing this solvent.

17ahprgnlone,387-79-1,28750,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): 17a-Hydroxypregnenolone is a 21-carbon steroid that is converted from pregnenolone by cytochrome P450 17alpha hydroxylase/C17,20 lyase (CYP17, EC 1.14.99.9). 17a-Hydroxypregnenolone is an intermediate in the delta-5 pathway of biosynthesis of gonadal steroid hormones and the adrenal corticosteroids. The first, rate-limiting and hormonally regulated step in the biosynthesis of all steroid hormones is the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone. The conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone is accomplished by the cleavage of the cholesterol side chain, catalyzed by a mitochondrial cytochrome P450 enzyme termed P450scc where scc designates Side Chain Cleavage. All steroid hormones are made from the pregnenolone produced by P450scc; thus, the presence or absence of each of the activities of CYP17 directs this pregnenolone towards its final metabolic pathway. While all cytochrome P450 enzymes can catalyze multiple reactions on a single active site, CYP17 is the only one described to date in which these multiple activities are differentially regulated by a physiologic process. 17a-Hydroxypregnenolone is converted to dehydroepiandrosterone by the 17,20 lyase activity of CYP17. The ratio of the 17,20 lyase to 17 alpha-hydroxylase activity of CYP17 determines the ratio of C21 to C19 steroids produced. This ratio is regulated post-translationally by at least three factors: the abundance of the electron-donating protein P450 oxidoreductase, the presence of cytochrome b5, and the serine phosphorylation of CYP17.

It is derived from progesterone via 17-hydroxylase, a P450c17 enzyme, or from 17-hydroxypregnenolone via 3&#946;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/&#916;5-4 isomerase. 17-Hydroxyprogesterone is a natural progestin and in pregnancy increases in the third trimester primarily due to fetal adrenal production. This hormone is primarily produced in the adrenal glands and to some degree in the gonads, specifically the corpus luteum of the ovary. Normal levels are 3-90 ng/dl in children, and in women, 15-70 ng/dl prior to ovulation, and 35-290 ng/dl during the luteal phase. Measurements of levels of 17-hydroxyprogesterone are useful in the evaluation of patients with suspected congenital adrenal hyperplasia as the typical enzymes that are defective, namely 21-hydroxylase and 11&#946;-hydroxylase, lead to a build-up of 17OHP. In contrast, the rare patient with 17&#945;-hydroxylase deficiency will have very low or undetectable levels of 17OHP. 17OHP levels can also be used to measure contribution of progestational activity of the corpus luteum during pregnancy as progesterone but not 17OHP is also contributed by the placenta.",17-Hydroxyprogesterone,HMDB0000374,,,C01176,,FDB021992,17ahprgstrn,[H]O[C@]1(C(=O)C([H])([H])[H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])[C@@]2([H])[C@]3([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C4=C([H])C(=O)C([H])([H])C([H])([H])[C@]4(C([H])([H])[H])[C@@]3([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])[C@]12C([H])([H])[H],"17-Hydroxypregn-4-en-3,20-dione***17alpha-Hydroxy-4-pregnene-3,20-dione***17alpha-Hydroxy-progesterone***delta(4)-Pregnene-17alpha-ol-3,20-dione***Hidroxiprogesterona***Hydroxyprogesterone***Hydroxyprogesteronum***Pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione-17-ol***17a-Hydroxy-4-pregnene-3,20-dione***17α-hydroxy-4-pregnene-3,20-dione***17a-Hydroxy-progesterone***17α-hydroxy-progesterone***delta(4)-Pregnene-17a-ol-3,20-dione***δ(4)-pregnene-17α-ol-3,20-dione***δ(4)-pregnene-17a-ol-3,20-dione***17-alpha-Hydroxyprogesterone***17-Hydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione***17-OH Progesterone***17-OHP***17a-Hydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione***17a-Hydroxyprogesterone***17alpha-Hydroxyprogesterone***D4-Pregnen-17a-ol-3,20-dione***Gestageno***gestageno Gador***Pregn-4-en-17a-ol-3,20-dione***Prodix***Prodox***17 Hydroxyprogesterone***17-Hydroxyprogesterone, (17 alpha)-isomer***17 alpha Hydroxyprogesterone***17 alpha-Hydroxyprogesterone***17-Hydroxyprogesterone, (9 beta, 10 alpha)-isomer",DBPWSSGDRRHUNT-CEGNMAFCSA-N,"InChI=1S/C21H30O3/c1-13(22)21(24)11-8-18-16-5-4-14-12-15(23)6-9-19(14,2)17(16)7-10-20(18,21)3/h12,16-18,24H,4-11H2,1-3H3/t16-,17+,18+,19+,20+,21+/m1/s1"

25aics,3031-95-6,18319,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): SAICAR (or (S)-2-[5-amino-1-(5-phospho-D-ribosyl)imidazole-4-carboxamido]succinate) is a substrate for the multifunctional protein ADE2. SAICAR is an intermediate in purine metabolism. SAICAR is converted from 5-amino-1-(5-phospho-D-ribosyl) imidazole-4-carboxylate via phosphoribosylaminoimidazole-succinocarboxamide synthase (EC: 6.3.2.6) or SAICAR synthase. This enzyme catalyses the seventh step out of ten in the biosynthesis of purine nucleotides. The appearance of succinylaminoimidazolecarboxamide riboside (SAICAriboside) and succinyladenosine (S-Ado) in cerebrospinal fluid, in urine, and, to a lesser extent, in plasma is characteristic of a heritable deficiency known as adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency. Adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency is responsible for a range of symptoms that involve psychomotor retardation, often accompanied by epileptic seizures, and autistic features. When present in sufficiently high levels, SAICAR can act as an oncometabolite, a metabotoxin, and an acidogen. An oncometabolite is a compound that promotes tumour growth and survival. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. As an oncometabolite, high levels of SAICAR stimulate pyruvate kinase isoform M2 and promote cancer cell survival in glucose-limited conditions such as aerobic glycolysis (PMID: 23086999). As an organic acid, SAICAR is associated with acidosis. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart, liver, and kidney abnormalities, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of untreated adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency. Many affected children with organic acidemias experience intellectual disability or delayed development.",SAICAR,HMDB0000797,,,C04823,P-RIBOSYL-4-SUCCCARB-AMINOIMIDAZOLE,FDB022251,25aics,[H]O[C@@]1([H])[C@@]([H])(O[C@]([H])(C([H])([H])OP([O-])([O-])=O)[C@@]1([H])O[H])N1C([H])=NC(C(=O)N([H])C([H])(C([O-])=O)C([H])([H])C([O-])=O)=C1N([H])[H],"(2S)-2-[5-amino-1-(5-phospho-beta-D-Ribosyl)imidazole-4-carboxamido]succinic acid***(S)-2-[5-amino-1-(5-phospho-D-Ribosyl)imidazole-4-carboxamido]succinate***1-(5'-Phosphoribosyl)-4-(N-succinocarboxamide)-5-aminoimidazole***1-(5'-Phosphoribosyl)-5-amino-4-(N-succinocarboxamide)-imidazole***5'-Phosphoribosyl-4-(N-succinocarboxamide)-5-aminoimidazole***SAICA riboside***succino-AICAR***Succinyl-5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-ribose-5-phosphate***Succinylaminoimidazolecarboxamide ribose-5'-phosphate***(2S)-2-[5-amino-1-(5-phospho-b-D-Ribosyl)imidazole-4-carboxamido]succinate***(2S)-2-[5-amino-1-(5-phospho-b-D-Ribosyl)imidazole-4-carboxamido]succinic acid***(2S)-2-[5-amino-1-(5-phospho-beta-D-Ribosyl)imidazole-4-carboxamido]succinate***(2S)-2-[5-amino-1-(5-phospho-β-D-ribosyl)imidazole-4-carboxamido]succinate***(2S)-2-[5-amino-1-(5-phospho-β-D-ribosyl)imidazole-4-carboxamido]succinic acid***(S)-2-[5-amino-1-(5-phospho-D-Ribosyl)imidazole-4-carboxamido]succinic acid***Succinyl-5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-ribose-5-phosphoric acid***Succinylaminoimidazolecarboxamide ribose-5'-phosphoric acid***(S)-2-(5-amino-1-(5-phospho-D-Ribosyl)imidazole-4-carboxamido)succinate***(S)-2-(5-amino-1-(5-phospho-D-Ribosyl)imidazole-4-carboxamido)succinic acid***(S)-2-(5-amino-1-(5-phospho-delta-Ribosyl)imidazole-4-carboxamido)succinate***(S)-2-(5-amino-1-(5-phospho-delta-Ribosyl)imidazole-4-carboxamido)succinic acid***(S)-2-[5-amino-1-(5-phospho-delta-Ribosyl)imidazole-4-carboxamido]succinate***1-(5'-Phosphoribosyl)-5-amino-4-(N-succinocarboxamide)-imidazole' 1-(5'-phosphoribosyl)-4-(N-succinocarboxamide)-5-aminoimidazole***5'-Phosphoribosyl-4-(N-succinocarbozamide)-5-aminoimidazole***5-amino-4-Imidazole-N-succinocarboxamide ribonucleotide***L-N-[(5-amino-1-b-D-Ribofuranosylimidazol-4-yl)carbonyl]-5'-(dihydrogen phosphate)***L-N-[(5-amino-1-beta-delta-Ribofuranosylimidazol-4-yl)carbonyl]-5'-(dihydrogen phosphate)***N-(5-amino-1-Ribofuranosylimidazol-4-ylcarbonyl)aspartic acid 5'-phosphate***N-[5-amino-1-(5'-Phosphoribofuranosyl)-4-imidazolecarbonyl]aspartate***N-[5-amino-1-(5'-Phosphoribofuranosyl)-4-imidazolecarbonyl]aspartic acid***Phosphoribosylaminoimidazolesuccinocarboxamide***SAICAriboside***Succinylaminoimidazole carboxamide riboside***Succinyl-aicar***N-(5-amino-1-beta-D-Ribofuranosylimidazole-4-carbonyl)-L-aspartic acid 5'-phosphate***5'-Phosphoribosyl-4-(N-succinylcarboxamide)-5-aminoimidazole***SAICAR, (D)-isomer",NAQGHJTUZRHGAC-GYAZKSLVSA-J,"InChI=1S/C13H19N4O12P/c14-10-7(11(22)16-4(13(23)24)1-6(18)19)15-3-17(10)12-9(21)8(20)5(29-12)2-28-30(25,26)27/h3-5,8-9,12,20-21H,1-2,14H2,(H,16,22)(H,18,19)(H,23,24)(H2,25,26,27)/p-4/t4?,5-,8-,9-,12-/m0/s1"

DAPA is incorporated or integrated into peptidoglycan of gram negative bacteria and is the attachment point for Braun's lipoprotein (BLP or Murein Lipoprotein). BLP is found in gram-negative cell walls and is one of the most abundant membrane proteins. BLP is bound at its C-terminal end (a lysine) by a covalent bond to the peptidoglycan layer (specifically to diaminopimelic acid molecules) and is embedded in the outer membrane by its hydrophobic head (a cysteine with lipids attached). BLP tightly links the two layers and provides structural integrity to the bacterial outer membrane.

2hb,600-15-7,1148,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): 2-Hydroxybutyric acid (alpha-hydroxybutyrate) is an organic acid derived from alpha-ketobutyrate. Alpha-ketobutyrate is produced by amino acid catabolism (threonine and methionine) and glutathione anabolism (cysteine formation pathway) and is metabolized to propionyl-CoA and carbon dioxide (PMID: 20526369 ). 2-Hydroxybutyric acid is formed as a by-product during the formation of Alpha-ketobutyrate via a reaction catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) or alpha–hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (alpha–HBDH). Alpha-hydroxybutyric acid is primarily produced in mammalian hepatic tissues that catabolize L-threonine or synthesize glutathione. Oxidative stress or detoxification of xenobiotics in the liver can dramatically increase the rate of hepatic glutathione synthesis. Under such metabolic stress conditions, supplies of L-cysteine for glutathione synthesis become limiting, so homocysteine is diverted from the transmethylation pathway (which forms methionine) into the transsulfuration pathway (which forms cystathionine). 2-Hydroxybutyrate is released as a byproduct when cystathionine is cleaved to cysteine that is incorporated into glutathione. Chronic shifts in the rate of glutathione synthesis may be reflected by urinary excretion of 2-hydroxybutyrate. 2-hydroxybutyrate is an early marker for both insulin resistance and impaired glucose regulation that appears to arise due to increased lipid oxidation and oxidative stress (PMID: 20526369 ). 2-Hydroxybutyric acid is often found in the urine of patients suffering from lactic acidosis and ketoacidosis. 2-Hydroxybutyric acid generally appears at high concentrations in situations related to deficient energy metabolism (e.g., birth asphyxia) and also in inherited metabolic diseases such as pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency and in those affecting the central nervous system during neonatal development, such as ""cerebral"" lactic acidosis, glutaric aciduria type II, dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3) deficiency, and propionic acidemia. More recently it has been noted that elevated levels of alpha-hydroxybutyrate in the plasma is a good marker for early stage type II diabetes (PMID:19166731 ). It was concluded from studies done in the mid 1970's that an increased NADH2/NAD ratio was the most important factor for the production of 2-hydroxybutyric acid (PMID:168632 ).",2-Hydroxybutyric acid,HMDB0000008,,,C05984,CPD-3564,FDB021867,2hb,[H]OC([H])(C([O-])=O)C([H])([H])C([H])([H])[H],"2-Hydroxybutanoic acid***alpha-Hydroxybutanoic acid***alpha-Hydroxybutyric acid***2-Hydroxybutanoate***2-Hydroxybutyrate***a-Hydroxybutanoate***a-Hydroxybutanoic acid***alpha-Hydroxybutanoate***α-hydroxybutanoate***α-hydroxybutanoic acid***a-Hydroxybutyrate***a-Hydroxybutyric acid***alpha-Hydroxybutyrate***α-hydroxybutyrate***α-hydroxybutyric acid***(RS)-2-Hydroxybutyrate***(RS)-2-Hydroxybutyric acid***2-Hydroxy-butanoate***2-Hydroxy-butanoic acid***2-Hydroxy-DL-butyrate***2-Hydroxy-DL-butyric acid***2-Hydroxy-N-butyrate***2-Hydroxy-N-butyric acid***a-Hydroxy-N-butyrate***a-Hydroxy-N-butyric acid***alpha-Hydroxy-N-butyrate***alpha-Hydroxy-N-butyric acid***DL-2-Hydroxybutanoate***DL-2-Hydroxybutanoic acid***DL-a-Hydroxybutyrate***DL-a-Hydroxybutyric acid***DL-alpha-Hydroxybutyrate***DL-alpha-Hydroxybutyric acid***2-Hydroxybutyric acid, (R)-isomer***2-Hydroxybutyric acid, monosodium salt***2-Hydroxybutyric acid, (+-)-isomer***2-Hydroxybutyric acid, monosodium salt, (+-)-isomer",AFENDNXGAFYKQO-UHFFFAOYSA-M,"InChI=1S/C4H8O3/c1-2-3(5)4(6)7/h3,5H,2H2,1H3,(H,6,7)/p-1"

34dhpha,102-32-9,41941,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) is a phenolic acid. DOPAC is a neuronal metabolite of dopamine (DA). DA undergoes monoamine oxidase-catalyzed oxidative deamination to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL), which is metabolized primarily to DOPAC via aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2). The biotransformation of DOPAL is critical as previous studies have demonstrated this DA-derived aldehyde to be a reactive electrophile and toxic to dopaminergic cells. Known inhibitors of mitochondrial ALDH2, such as 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4HNE) inhibit ALDH2-mediated oxidation of the endogenous neurotoxin DOPAL. 4HNE is one of the resulting products of oxidative stress, thus linking oxidative stress to the uncontrolled production of an endogenous neurotoxin relevant to Parkinson's disease. In early onset Parkinson disease there is markedly reduced activities of both monoamine oxidase (MAO) A and B. The amount of DOPAC, which is produced during dopamine oxidation by MAO, is greatly reduced as a result of increased parkin overexpression. Administration of methamphetamine to animals causes loss of DA terminals in the brain, and significant decreases in Dopamine and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) in the striata. Renal dopamine produced in the residual tubular units may be enhanced during a sodium challenge, thus behaving appropriately as a compensatory natriuretic hormone; however the renal dopaminergic system in patients afflicted with renal parenchymal disorders should address parameters other than free urinary dopamine, namely the urinary excretion of L-DOPA and metabolites. DOPAC is one of the major phenolic acids formed during human microbial fermentation of tea, citrus, and soy flavonoid supplements. DOPAC exhibits a considerable antiproliferative effect in LNCaP prostate cancer and HCT116 colon cancer cells. The antiproliferative activity of DOPAC may be due to its catechol structure. A similar association of the catechol moiety in the B-ring with antiproliferative activity was demonstrated for flavanones.

In particular, it is metabolized to dopamine by aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase. Pyridoxal phosphate (vitamin B6) is a required cofactor for this decarboxylation, and may be administered along with levodopa, usually as pyridoxine. L-Dopa is used for the treatment of Parkinsonian disorders and Dopa-Responsive Dystonia and is usually given with agents that inhibit its conversion to dopamine outside of the central nervous system. Peripheral tissue conversion may be the mechanism of the adverse effects of levodopa.

The concentration of beta-Aminoisobutyric acid is normally low in urine as beta-Aminoisobutyric acid is further catabolized by b-aminoisobutyrate aminotransferases to methylmalonic acid semialdehyde and propionyl-CoA. beta-Aminoisobutyric acid occurs in two isomeric forms and both enantiomers of beta-Aminoisobutyric acid can be detected in human urine and plasma. In plasma, the S-enantiomer is the predominant type due to active renal reabsorption. In contrast, urine almost exclusively contains the R-enantiomer of beta-Aminoisobutyric acid, which is eliminated both by filtration and tubular secretion. Persistently increased levels of beta-Aminoisobutyric acid have been observed in individuals with a deficiency of R (-) -b-aminoisobutyrate-pyruvate aminotransferase. In addition, transient high levels of beta-Aminoisobutyric acid have been observed under a variety of pathological conditions such as lead poisoning, starvation, in total body irradiation and in a number of malignancies. The S-enantiomer of beta-Aminoisobutyric acid is predominantly derived from the catabolism of valine. It has been suggested that an altered homoeostasis of b-alanine underlies some of the clinical abnormalities encountered in patients with a dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency. DPD constitutes the first step of the pyrimidine degradation pathway, in which the pyrimidine bases uracil and thymine are catabolized to b-alanine and the R-enantiomer of beta-Aminoisobutyric acid respectively. In normal individuals with an intact pyrimidine degradation pathway, R-methylmalonic acid semialdehyde can be synthesized directly from the catabolism of thymine. Hence, there might be less cross-over between the valine and thymine pathway, allowing the conversion of S-methylmalonic acid semialdehyde into S-beta-Aminoisobutyric acid and the subsequent accumulation of S-beta-Aminoisobutyric acid in plasma.

3hhdcoa,,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): (S)-3-Hydroxyhexadecanoyl-CoA is a beta-oxidation intermediate derivative of palmitoyl-CoA and the substrate of the enzyme peroxisomal acyl-CoA thioesterase 2 (PTE-2, EC 3.1.2.2), which is localized in the peroxisome. The peroxisomal beta-oxidation system contains two sets of enzymes, one of which is involved in the oxidation of branched chain fatty acids and intermediates in the hepatic bile acid biosynthetic pathway and consists of one or two branched-chain acyl-CoA oxidase(s), a D-specific bifunctional protein and the sterol carrier-like protein x (SCPx). Peroxisomes are cellular organelles present in all eukaryotic cells. They play an indispensable role in the metabolism of a variety of lipids including very long-chain fatty acids, dicarboxylic fatty acids, bile acids, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, thromboxanes, pristanic acid, and xenobiotic fatty acids. (S)-3-Hydroxyhexadecanoyl-CoA may accumulate intracellularly in certain long-chain fatty acid/j-oxidation deficiencies. Succinate-driven synthesis of ATP from ADP and phosphate is progressively inhibited by increasing concentrations of (S)-3-Hydroxyhexadecanoyl-CoA.

3hivac,625-08-1,37084,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): 3-Hydroxyisovaleric acid is a normal human metabolite excreted in the urine. It is a byproduct of the leucine degradation pathway. Production of 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid begins with the conversion of 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA into 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA in the mitochondria by the biotin-dependent enzyme methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase. Biotin deficiencies, certain lifestyle habits (smoking), or specific genetic conditions can reduce methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase activity. This reduction can lead to a buildup of 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA, which is converted into 3-hydroxyisovaleryl-CoA by the enzyme enoyl-CoA hydratase. Increased concentrations of 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA and 3-hydroxyisovaleryl-CoA can lead to a disruption of the esterified CoA:free CoA ratio, and ultimately to mitochondrial toxicity. Detoxification of these metabolic end products occur via the transfer of the 3-hydroxyisovaleryl moiety to carnitine forming 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid-carnitine or 3HIA-carnitine, which is then transferred across the inner mitochondrial membrane where 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid is released as the free acid (PMID: 21918059). 3-Hydroxyisovaleric acid has been found to be elevated in smokers and in subjects undergoing long-term anticonvulsant therapy with carbamazepine and/or phenytoin. These levels are elevated due to impairment of renal reclamation of biotin. Levels may also be increased from prolonged consumption of raw egg-whites (PMID: 16895887, 9523856, 15447901, 9176832) (OMIM: 210210, 253270, 600529, 253260, 246450, 210200, 238331). When present in sufficiently high levels, 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid can act as an acidogen and a metabotoxin. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid are associated with at least a dozen inborn errors of metabolism, including 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency, 3-methylglutaconic aciduria type I, biotinidase deficiency and isovaleric aciduria, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase deficiency, 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase 1 deficiency, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency, late-onset multiple carboxylase deficiency, holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency, and 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase 2 deficiency. 3-Hydroxyisovaleric acid is an organic acid. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart, liver, and kidney abnormalities, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of the untreated IEMs mentioned above. Many affected children with organic acidemias experience intellectual disability or delayed development. In adults, acidosis or acidemia is characterized by headaches, confusion, feeling tired, tremors, sleepiness, and seizures.",3-Hydroxyisovaleric Acid,HMDB0000754,,,C20827,,,3hivac,[H]OC(C([H])([H])[H])(C([H])([H])[H])C([H])([H])C([O-])=O,3-Hydroxy-3-methylbutyric acid***3-Hydroxy-isovaleric acid***3-Methyl-3-hydroxybutyric acid***3-OH-Isovaleric acid***beta-Hydroxy-beta-methylbutyric acid***beta-Hydroxyisovaleric acid***HMB***HMB-D6***3-Hydroxy-3-methylbutyrate***3-Hydroxyisovalerate***3-Hydroxy-isovalerate***3-Methyl-3-hydroxybutyrate***3-OH-Isovalerate***b-Hydroxy-b-methylbutyrate***b-Hydroxy-b-methylbutyric acid***beta-Hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate***β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate***β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyric acid***b-Hydroxyisovalerate***b-Hydroxyisovaleric acid***beta-Hydroxyisovalerate***β-hydroxyisovalerate***β-hydroxyisovaleric acid***3-Hydroxy-3-methyl-butanoate***3-Hydroxy-3-methyl-butanoic acid***3-Hydroxy-3-methyl-butyric acid***3-Hydroxy-3-methylbutanoate***3-Hydroxy-3-methylbutanoic acid***beta Hydroxy beta methylbutyrate***beta-Hydroxy beta-methylbutyrate,AXFYFNCPONWUHW-UHFFFAOYSA-M,"InChI=1S/C5H10O3/c1-5(2,8)3-4(6)7/h8H,3H2,1-2H3,(H,6,7)/p-1"

3hpp,503-66-2,33404,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): 3-Hydroxypropionic acid is a carboxylic acid. It is an intermediate in the breakdown of branched-chain amino acids and propionic acid from the gut. Typically it originates from propionyl-CoA and a defect in the enzyme propionyl carboxylase. This leads to a buildup in propionyl-CoA in the mitochondria.  Such a buildup can lead to a disruption of the esterified CoA:free CoA ratio and ultimately to mitochondrial toxicity. Detoxification of these metabolic end products occurs via the transfer of the propionyl moiety to carnitine-forming propionyl-carnitine, which is then transferred across the inner mitochondrial membrane. 3-Hydroxypropionic acid is then released as the free acid. As an industrial chemical, it is used in the production of various chemicals such as acrylates in industry. When present in sufficiently high levels, 3-hydroxypropionic acid can act as an acidogen and a metabotoxin. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of hydroxypropionic acid are associated with many inborn errors of metabolism including biotinidase deficiency, malonic aciduria, methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency, methylmalonic aciduria, methylmalonic aciduria due to cobalamin-related disorders, and propionic acidemia. Hydroxypropionic acid is an organic acid. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. Infants with acidosis have symptoms that include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart, liver, and kidney abnormalities, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of the IEMs mentioned above. Many affected children with organic acidemias experience intellectual disability or delayed development. In adults, acidosis or acidemia is characterized by headaches, confusion, feeling tired, tremors, sleepiness, and seizures.",Hydroxypropionic acid,HMDB0000700,,,C01013,,FDB022189,3hpp,[H]OC([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([O-])=O,3-HYDROXY-propanoIC ACID***3-Hydroxypropanoic acid***beta-Hydroxypropionic acid***Hydracrylic acid***3-HYDROXY-propanoate***Hydroxypropionate***3-Hydroxypropanoate***b-Hydroxypropionate***b-Hydroxypropionic acid***beta-Hydroxypropionate***β-hydroxypropionate***β-hydroxypropionic acid***Hydracrylate***2-Deoxyglycerate***2-Deoxyglyceric acid***3-Hydroxypropionate***3-Hydroxypropionic acid***b-Lactate***b-Lactic acid***beta-Lactate***beta-Lactic acid***Ethylenelactate***Ethylenelactic acid,ALRHLSYJTWAHJZ-UHFFFAOYSA-M,"InChI=1S/C3H6O3/c4-2-1-3(5)6/h4H,1-2H2,(H,5,6)/p-1"

The biotechnological production of 3-Hydroxypropanal from renewable resources is desirable both for use of 3-Hydroxypropanal in foods and for the production of bulk chemicals.

3mlda,2625-49-2,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Methylimidazoleacetic acid is the main metabolite of histamine. This end product of histamine catabolism is formed by N-methylation in the imidazole ring to methylhistamine by histamine methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.8) and a subsequent oxidative deamination in the side chain by type B monoamine oxidase (EC 1.4.3.4). From studies is known that as much as 70 to 80 percent of the histamine metabolized in the body is excreted in the urine as Methylimidazoleacetic acid. Thus, urinary Methylimidazoleacetic acid being the major and specific histamine metabolite is a clear marker of any changes in histamine metabolism in the body. The urinary excretion of methylimidazoleacetic acid is considered a reliable indicator of histamine turnover rate in the body. The excretion of Methylimidazoleacetic acid is higher in men than women however; this gender difference is abolished when corrected for creatinine excretion. A possible explanation is that basal histamine turnover is related to body size. There is no significant difference in Methylimidazoleacetic acid excretion between smokers and non-smokers when analysing absolute values (mg/24 h). When using Methylimidazoleacetic acid values corrected for creatinine excretion female smokers have significantly higher Methylimidazoleacetic acid excretion compared to nonsmokers.

A neurotoxin causes damage to nerve cells and nerve tissues. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of alpha-ketoisovaleric acid are associated with maple syrup urine disease. MSUD is a metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency of the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC), leading to a buildup of the branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) and their toxic by-products (ketoacids) in the blood and urine. The symptoms of MSUD often show in infancy and lead to severe brain damage if untreated. MSUD may also present later depending on the severity of the disease. If left untreated in older individuals, during times of metabolic crisis, symptoms of the condition include uncharacteristically inappropriate, extreme, or erratic behaviour and moods, hallucinations, anorexia, weight loss, anemia, diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, lethargy, oscillating hypertonia and hypotonia, ataxia, seizures, hypoglycemia, ketoacidosis, opisthotonus, pancreatitis, rapid neurological decline, and coma.  In maple syrup urine disease, the brain concentration of branched-chain ketoacids can increase 10- to 20-fold. This leads to a depletion of glutamate and a consequent reduction in the concentration of brain glutamine, aspartate, alanine, and other amino acids. The result is a compromise of energy metabolism because of a failure of the malate-aspartate shuttle and a diminished rate of protein synthesis (PMID: 15930465). alpha-Ketoisovaleric acid is a keto-acid, which is a subclass of organic acids. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart, liver, and kidney abnormalities, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of untreated MSUD.

Peroxisomes beta -oxidize a wide variety of substrates including straight chain fatty acids, 2-methyl-branched fatty acids, and the side chain of the bile acid intermediates di- and trihydroxycoprostanic acids. Peroxisomes contain several beta -oxidation pathways with different substrate specificities; or example, straight chain acyl-CoAs are desaturated by palmitoyl-CoA oxidase, and their enoyl-CoAs are then converted to 3-oxoacyl-CoAs by MFP-1, which forms (hydration) and dehydrogenates L-3(3S)-hydroxyacyl-CoAs; for example, straight chain acyl-CoAs are desaturated by palmitoyl-CoA oxidase (23), and their enoyl-CoAs are then converted to 3-oxoacyl-CoAs by 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.35), which forms (hydration) and dehydrogenates L-3(3S)-hydroxyacyl-CoAs and their enoyl-CoAs are then converted to the corresponding 3-oxoacyl-CoAs by long-chain-enoyl-CoA hydratase(EC 4.2.1.74), which forms and dehydrogenates D-3(3R)-hydroxyacyl-CoAs.

In humans cysteine catabolism is tightly regulated via regulation of cysteine dioxygenase (CDO) levels in the liver, with the turnover of CDO protein being dramatically decreased when intracellular cysteine levels increase. This occurs in response to changes in the intracellular cysteine concentration via changes in the rate of CDO ubiquitination and degradation. Expressed at high levels in the liver with lower levels in the kidney, brain, and lung, cysteine dioxygenase catalyzes the addition of molecular oxygen to the sulfhydryl group of cysteine, yielding cysteinesulfinic acid. The oxidative catabolism of cysteine to cysteinesulfinate by CDO represents an irreversible loss of cysteine from the free amino acid pool.

4abut,56-12-2,16865,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is an inhibitory neurotransmitter found in the nervous systems of widely divergent species, including humans. It is the chief inhibitory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate central nervous system. In vertebrates, GABA acts at inhibitory synapses in the brain. It acts by binding to specific transmembrane receptors in the plasma membrane of both pre- and postsynaptic neurons. This binding causes the opening of ion channels to allow either the flow of negatively-charged chloride ions into the cell or positively-charged potassium ions out of the cell. This will typically result in a negative change in the transmembrane potential, usually causing hyperpolarization. Three general classes of GABA receptor are known (PMID: 10561820). These include GABA-A and GABA-C ionotropic receptors, which are ion channels themselves, and GABA-B metabotropic receptors, which are G protein-coupled receptors that open ion channels via intermediaries known as G proteins (PMID: 10561820). Activation of the GABA-B receptor by GABA causes neuronal membrane hyperpolarization and a resultant inhibition of neurotransmitter release. In addition to binding sites for GABA, the GABA-A receptor has binding sites for benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and neurosteroids. GABA-A receptors are coupled to chloride ion channels. Therefore, activation of the GABA-A receptor induces increased inward chloride ion flux, resulting in membrane hyperpolarization and neuronal inhibition (PMID: 10561820). After release into the synapse, free GABA that does not bind to either the GABA-A or GABA-B receptor complexes can be taken up by neurons and glial cells. Four different GABA membrane transporter proteins (GAT-1, GAT-2, GAT-3, and BGT-1), which differ in their distribution in the CNS, are believed to mediate the uptake of synaptic GABA into neurons and glial cells. The GABA-A receptor subtype regulates neuronal excitability and rapid changes in fear arousal, such as anxiety, panic, and the acute stress response (PMID: 10561820). Drugs that stimulate GABA-A receptors, such as the benzodiazepines and barbiturates, have anxiolytic and anti-seizure effects via GABA-A-mediated reduction of neuronal excitability, which effectively raises the seizure threshold. GABA-A antagonists produce convulsions in animals and there is decreased GABA-A receptor binding in a positron emission tomography (PET) study of patients with panic disorder. Neurons that produce GABA as their output are called GABAergic neurons and have chiefly inhibitory action at receptors in the vertebrate. Medium spiny neurons (MSNs) are a typical example of inhibitory CNS GABAergic cells. GABA has been shown to have excitatory roles in the vertebrate, most notably in the developing cortex. Organisms synthesize GABA from glutamate using the enzyme L-glutamic acid decarboxylase and pyridoxal phosphate as a cofactor (PMID: 12467378). It is worth noting that this involves converting the principal excitatory neurotransmitter (glutamate) into the principal inhibitory one (GABA). Drugs that act as agonists of GABA receptors (known as GABA analogs or GABAergic drugs), or increase the available amount of GABA typically have relaxing, anti-anxiety, and anti-convulsive effects. GABA is found to be deficient in cerebrospinal fluid and the brain in many studies of experimental and human epilepsy. Benzodiazepines (such as Valium) are useful in status epilepticus because they act on GABA receptors. GABA increases in the brain after administration of many seizure medications. Hence, GABA is clearly an antiepileptic nutrient. Inhibitors of GAM metabolism can also produce convulsions. Spasticity and involuntary movement syndromes, such as Parkinson's, Friedreich's ataxia, tardive dyskinesia, and Huntington's chorea, are all marked by low GABA when amino acid levels are studied. Trials of 2 to 3 g of GABA given orally have been effective in various epilepsy and spasticity syndromes. Agents that elevate GABA are also useful in lowering hypertension. Three grams orally have been effective in controlling blood pressure. GABA is decreased in various encephalopathies. GABA can reduce appetite and is decreased in hypoglycemics. GABA reduces blood sugar in diabetics. Chronic brain syndromes can also be marked by deficiencies of GABA. Vitamin B6, manganese, taurine, and lysine can increase both GABA synthesis and effects, while aspartic acid and glutamic acid probably inhibit GABA effects. Low plasma GABA has been reported in some depressed patients and may be a useful trait marker for mood disorders. GABA has an important role in embryonic development, especially facial development, as substantiated by the association of a cleft palate in transgenic mice deficient in GAD67 (glutamate decarboxylase). A recent Japanese population study reported linkage in patients with a nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without a cleft palate and specific GAD67 haplotypes (PMID: 23842532). Unusually high levels of GABA (especially in the brain) can be toxic and GABA can function as both a neurotoxin and a metabotoxin. A neurotoxin is a compound that damages the brain and/or nerve tissue. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of GABA are associated with at least five inborn errors of metabolism, including D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria, 4-hydroxybutyric aciduria/succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency, GABA-transaminase deficiency, homocarnosinosis, and hyper beta-alaninemia. Nearly all of these conditions are associated with seizures, hypotonia, intellectual deficits, macrocephaly, encephalopathy, and other serious neurological or neuromuscular problems. Increased levels of GABA seem to alter the function of the GABA-B receptor, which may play a role in the tonic-clonic seizures that are often seen in patients with the above disorders.",gamma-Aminobutyric acid,HMDB0000112,,,C00334,4-AMINO-BUTYRATE,FDB008937,4abut,[H][N+]([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([O-])=O,"4-Aminobutanoic acid***4-Aminobutyric acid***4Abu***GABA***GAMMA-amino-BUTANOIC ACID***gamma-amino-N-Butyric acid***gamma-Aminobutanoic acid***gamma-Aminobuttersaeure***Omega-aminobutyric acid***Piperidic acid***Piperidinic acid***4-Aminobutanoate***g-Aminobutyrate***g-Aminobutyric acid***gamma-Aminobutyrate***γ-aminobutyrate***γ-aminobutyric acid***4-Aminobutyrate***g-amino-BUTANOate***g-amino-BUTANOic acid***gamma-amino-BUTANOate***γ-amino-butanoate***γ-amino-butanoic acid***g-amino-N-Butyrate***g-amino-N-Butyric acid***gamma-amino-N-Butyrate***γ-amino-N-butyrate***γ-amino-N-butyric acid***g-Aminobutanoate***g-Aminobutanoic acid***gamma-Aminobutanoate***γ-aminobutanoate***γ-aminobutanoic acid***g-Aminobuttersaeure***γ-aminobuttersaeure***Omega-aminobutyrate***Piperidate***Piperidinate***3-Carboxypropylamine***Aminalon***Gaballon***Gamarex***gamma Aminobutyrate***gamma Aminobutyric acid***Gammalon***Gammalone***Gammar***Gammasol***Mielogen***Mielomade***W-Aminobutyrate***W-Aminobutyric acid***gamma-Aminobutyric acid, calcium salt (2:1)***gamma-Aminobutyric acid, hydrochloride***gamma-Aminobutyric acid, zinc salt (2:1)***4 Aminobutanoic acid***4 Aminobutyric acid***Lithium gaba***gamma Aminobutyric acid, monolithium salt***gamma Aminobutyric acid, monosodium salt***gamma-Aminobutyric acid, monolithium salt***gamma-Aminobutyric acid, monosodium salt***Acid, hydrochloride gamma-aminobutyric***Aminalone***GABA, lithium***Hydrochloride gamma-aminobutyric acid***gamma Aminobutyric acid, hydrochloride",BTCSSZJGUNDROE-UHFFFAOYSA-N,"InChI=1S/C4H9NO2/c5-3-1-2-4(6)7/h1-3,5H2,(H,6,7)"

PABA is a white crystalline substance that is only slightly soluble in water. It consists of a benzene ring substituted with an amino group and a carboxylic acid. PABA is an essential nutrient for some bacteria and is sometimes called Vitamin Bx. However, PABA is not essential for humans and it varies in its activity from other B vitamins. PABA is sometimes marketed as an essential nutrient under the premise that it can stimulate intestinal bacteria. Certain bacteria in the human intestinal tract such as E. coli generate PABA from chorismate. Humans lack the enzymes to convert PABA to folate, and therefore require folate from dietary sources such as green leafy vegetables. Although some intestinal bacteria can synthesize folate from PABA and some E. coli can synthesize folate this requires six enzymatic activities in folate synthesis which are not all done in the same bacteria. PABA used to be a common sunscreening agent until found to also be a sensitizer. The potassium salt of PABA is used therapeutically in fibrotic skin disorders.",4-Aminobenzoate,HMDB0001392,,,,,,,,,,

4hdxbutn,591-81-1,30830,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): 4-Hydroxybutyric acid (also known as gamma-hydroxybutyrate or GHB) is a precursor and a metabolite of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). GHB acts as a central nervous system (CNS) neuromodulator, mediating its effects through GABA and GHB-specific receptors, or by affecting dopamine transmission (PMID: 16620539). GHB occurs naturally in all mammals, but its function remains unknown. GHB is labeled as an illegal drug in most countries, but it also is used as a legal drug (Xyrem) in patients with narcolepsy. It is used illegally (under the street names juice, liquid ecstasy, or G) as an intoxicant for increasing athletic performance and as a date rape drug. In high doses, GHB inhibits the CNS, inducing sleep and inhibiting the respiratory drive. In lower doses, its euphoriant effect predominates (PMID: 17658710). When present in sufficiently high levels, 4-hydroxybutyric acid can act as an acidogen, a neurotoxin, and a metabotoxin. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A neurotoxin is a compound that adversely affects neural cells and tissues. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of 4-hydroxybutyric acid are associated with two inborn errors of metabolism: glutaric aciduria II and succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency (SSADH). SSADH deficiency leads to a 30-fold increase of GHB and a 2-4 fold increase of GABA in the brains of patients with SSADH deficiency as compared to normal brain concentrations of the compounds. As an acidogen, 4-hydroxybutyric acid is an organic acid, and abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart abnormalities, kidney abnormalities, liver damage, seizures, coma, and possibly death. Many affected children with organic acidemias experience intellectual disability or delayed development. These are also the characteristic symptoms of the untreated IEMs mentioned above. Particularly for SSADH deficiency, the most common features observed include developmental delay, hypotonia, and intellectual disability. Nearly half of patients exhibit ataxia, seizures, behaviour problems, and hyporeflexia. In adults, acidosis or acidemia is characterized by headaches, confusion, feeling tired, tremors, sleepiness, and seizures. As a neurotoxin, GHB appears to affect both GABA (a neurotransmitter) signaling and glutamate signaling (another neurotransmitter). Glutamine metabolism may also play a role in the pathophysiology of excessive levels of GHB. High levels of GHB have been shown to depress both the NMDA and AMPA/kainite receptor-mediated functions and may also alter glutamatergic excitatory synaptic transmission as well.",4-Hydroxybutyric acid,HMDB0000710,,,C00989,4-HYDROXY-BUTYRATE,FDB022196,,,3-Carboxypropoxy acid***4-Hydroxy-butyric acid***4-Hydroxyalkanoic acid***4-Hydroxybutanoate***4-Hydroxybutanoic acid***4-Hydroxycarboxylic acid***Gamma Hydroxybutyric acid***gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid***GHB***Oxy-N-butyric acid***Xyrem***4-Hydroxybutyrate***4-Hydroxy-butyrate***4-Hydroxyalkanoate***4-Hydroxycarboxylate***g Hydroxybutyrate***g Hydroxybutyric acid***gamma Hydroxybutyrate***γ hydroxybutyrate***γ hydroxybutyric acid***g-Hydroxybutyrate***g-Hydroxybutyric acid***gamma-Hydroxybutyrate***γ-hydroxybutyrate***γ-hydroxybutyric acid***Oxy-N-butyrate***4-Hydroxy-butanoate***4-Hydroxy-butanoic acid***4-Hydroxybutyrate sodium***4-Hydroxybutyric acid monosodium salt***gamma-Hydroxy butyrate***gamma-Hydroxy sodium butyrate***gamma-Hydroxybutyrate sodium***Hydroxybutyric acid,SJZRECIVHVDYJC-UHFFFAOYSA-N,"InChI=1S/C4H8O3/c5-3-1-2-4(6)7/h5H,1-3H2,(H,6,7)"

4hpro_LT,51-35-4,18095,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): 4-Hydroxyproline (hydroxyproline or Hyp) is a major component of the protein collagen. Hydroxyproline is produced by hydroxylation of the amino acid proline and is, therefore, a post-translationally modified amino acid. Hydroxyproline and proline play key roles for collagen stability. In particular, they permit the sharp twisting of the collagen helix. Hydroxyproline is found in few proteins other than collagen. The only other mammalian protein which includes hydroxyproline is elastin. For this reason, hydroxyproline content has been used as an indicator to determine collagen and/or gelatin amount in tissue or biological samples. Increased serum and urine levels of hydroxyproline have been found in Paget's disease (PMID: 436278). Hydroxyproline (Hyp) content in biological fluids is used as a parameter of collagen catabolism, especially bone resorption or tissue degradation. Bedridden and elderly individuals show significantly elevated serum levels of hydroxyproline in comparison to normal, active individuals (PMID: 10706420). Elevated levels of urinary hydroxyproline are also indicative of muscle damage (PMID: 21988268). Increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) are also known to accelerate collagen degradation. Hydroxyproline levels increase in cases of depression and stress (PMID: 21483218). 4-Hydroxyproline is found to be associated with Alzheimer's disease, and also hydroxyprolinemia and iminoglycinuria which are both inborn errors of metabolism. 4-Hydroxyproline is also involved in metabolic disorders such as hyperprolinemia type I, hyperornithinemia with gyrate atrophy (HOGA), L-arginine:glycine amidinotransferase deficiency, creatine deficiency, and guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency.

4mop,816-66-0,48430,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Ketoleucine is an abnormal metabolite that arises from the incomplete breakdown of branched-chain amino acids. Ketoleucine is both a neurotoxin and a metabotoxin. A neurotoxin causes damage to nerve cells and nerve tissues. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of ketoleucine are associated with maple syrup urine disease (MSUD). MSUD is a metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency of the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC), leading to a buildup of the branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) and their toxic by-products (ketoacids) in the blood and urine. The symptoms of MSUD often show in infancy and lead to severe brain damage if untreated. MSUD may also present later depending on the severity of the disease. If left untreated in older individuals, during times of metabolic crisis, symptoms of the condition include uncharacteristically inappropriate, extreme, or erratic behaviour and moods, hallucinations, anorexia, weight loss, anemia, diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, lethargy, oscillating hypertonia and hypotonia, ataxia, seizures, hypoglycemia, ketoacidosis, opisthotonus, pancreatitis, rapid neurological decline, and coma.  In maple syrup urine disease, the brain concentration of branched-chain ketoacids can increase 10- to 20-fold. This leads to a depletion of glutamate and a consequent reduction in the concentration of brain glutamine, aspartate, alanine, and other amino acids. The result is a compromise of energy metabolism because of a failure of the malate-aspartate shuttle and a diminished rate of protein synthesis (PMID: 15930465).",Ketoleucine,HMDB0000695,,,C00233,2K-4CH3-PENTANOATE,FDB012607,4mop,[H]C([H])([H])C([H])(C([H])([H])[H])C([H])([H])C(=O)C([O-])=O,2-oxo-4-METHYLPENTANOIC ACID***2-Oxoisocaproate***4-Methyl-2-oxopentanoate***4-Methyl-2-oxovaleric acid***alpha-Ketoisocaproic acid***2-oxo-4-METHYLPENTANOate***2-Oxoisocaproic acid***4-Methyl-2-oxopentanoic acid***4-Methyl-2-oxovalerate***a-Ketoisocaproate***a-Ketoisocaproic acid***alpha-Ketoisocaproate***α-ketoisocaproate***α-ketoisocaproic acid***2-keto-4-Methylvalerate***2-keto-4-Methylvaleric acid***2-Ketoisocaproate***2-Ketoisocaproic acid***2-oxo-4-Methylvalerate***2-oxo-4-Methylvaleric acid***2-Oxoleucine***4-Methyl-2-oxo-valerate***4-Methyl-2-oxo-valeric acid***a-Ketoisocapronate***a-Ketoisocapronic acid***a-Oxoisocaproate***a-Oxoisocaproic acid***alpha-keto-Isocaproate***alpha-keto-Isocaproic acid***alpha-Ketoisocapronate***alpha-Ketoisocapronic acid***alpha-Oxoisocaproate***alpha-Oxoisocaproic acid***Ketoisocaproate***Ketoisocaproic acid***Methyloxovalerate***Methyloxovaleric acid***Oxoisocaproate***Oxoisocaproic acid***Keto-leucine,BKAJNAXTPSGJCU-UHFFFAOYSA-M,"InChI=1S/C6H10O3/c1-4(2)3-5(7)6(8)9/h4H,3H2,1-2H3,(H,8,9)/p-1"

Today Xyrem is a Schedule III drug. However, GHB remains a Schedule I drug and the illicit use of Xyrem falls under penalties of Schedule I. GHB is a naturally occurring substance found in the central nervous system, wine, beef, small citrus fruits and almost all other living creatures in small amounts. It is used illegally under the street names Juice, Liquid Ecstasy or simply G, either as an intoxicant, or as a date rape drug. Xyrem is a central nervous system depressant that reduces excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy.

It can be generated from the enzymatic reduction of 5-aminopentanoate or enzymatic oxidation of L-lysine. Pseudomonas putida can catabolize L-lysine via the &#948;-aminovalerate (AMV) (5-aminopentanoate) pathway to glutarate. In this pathway, L-lysine is transported into the cell by basic amino acid transport systems. It is oxidatively decarboxylated to 5-aminopentanamide, which is then hydrolyzed to 5-aminopentanoate and ammonia. The conversion of 5-aminopentanoate to glutarate involves gene products of the davDT operon. Activation of glutarate to glutaryl-CoA by an as yet uncharacterized reaction(s) and further metabolism of glutaryl-CoA to carbon dioxide and acetyl-CoA have been demonstrated in Pseudomonas fluorescens.",5-Aminopentanamide,HMDB0012176,,,,,,,,,,

5aptn,660-88-8,15887,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): 5-aminovalerate (or 5-aminopentanoic acid) is a lysine degradation product.  It can be produced both endogenously or through bacterial catabolism of lysine.  5-aminovalerate is formed via the following multi-step reaction: L-lysine leads to cadverine leads to L-piperideine leads 5-aminovalerate (PMID: 405455).  In other words it is a metabolite of cadaverine which is formed via the intermediate, 1-piperideine (PMID: 6436440).  Cadaverine is a foul-smelling diamine compound produced by protein hydrolysis during putrefaction of animal tissue. High levels of 5-aminovalerate in biofluids may indicate bacterial overgrowth or endogenous tissue necrosis.  In most cases  endogenous 5-aminovalerate is thought to be primarily a microbial metabolite produced by the gut or oral microflora, although it can be produced endogenously.  5-aminovalerate is a normal metabolite present in human saliva, with a tendency to elevated concentration in patients with chronic periodontitis. Bacterial contamination and decomposition of salivary proteins is primarily responsible for elevated salivary levels (PMID 3481959). Beyond being a general waste product, 5-aminovalerate is also believed to act as a methylene homologue of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and functions as a weak GABA agonist (PMID: 4031870). It is also known as an antifibrinolytic amino acid analog and so it functions as a weak inhibitor of the blood clotting pathway (PMID: 6703712). 5-aminopentanoic acid is an in vivo substrate of 4-aminobutyrate:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase (PMID: 4031870).",5-Aminopentanoic acid,HMDB0003355,,,C00431,5-AMINOPENTANOATE,FDB023151,,,5-amino-N-Valeric acid***5-Aminopentanoate***5-Aminovaleric acid***DANVA***delta-amino-N-Valeric acid***delta-Aminovaleric acid***5-amino-N-Valerate***5-Aminovalerate***delta-amino-N-Valerate***δ-amino-N-valerate***δ-amino-N-valeric acid***delta-Aminovalerate***δ-aminovalerate***δ-aminovaleric acid***5-Aminovaleric acid hydrochloride,JJMDCOVWQOJGCB-UHFFFAOYSA-N,"InChI=1S/C5H11NO2/c6-4-2-1-3-5(7)8/h1-4,6H2,(H,7,8)"

5htrp,,28171,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): 5-Hydroxy-L-tryptophan is an aromatic amino acid naturally produced by the body from the essential amino acid L-tryptophan. 5-Hydroxy-L-tryptophan is the immediate precursor of the neurotransmitter serotonin. The conversion to serotonin is catalyzed by the enzyme aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.28) (AADC1 also known as DOPA decarboxylase), an essential enzyme in the metabolism of the monoamine neurotransmitters. An accumulation of 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan in cerebrospinal fluid occurs in aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency (AADC deficiency) (OMIM: 608643) accompanied by an increased excretion in the urine of the patients, which are indicative of the disorder but not specific. 5-Hydroxy-L-tryptophan is also increased in other disorders such as in Parkinson's patients with severe postural instability and gait disorders. The amount of endogenous 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan available for serotonin synthesis depends on the availability of tryptophan and on the activity of various enzymes, especially tryptophan hydroxylase (EC 1.14.16.4), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.52), and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) (EC 1.13.11.11). 5-Hydroxy-L-tryptophan has been used clinically for over 30 years. In addition to its use in the treatment of depression, the therapeutic administration of 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan has been shown to be effective in treating a wide variety of conditions, including fibromyalgia, insomnia, binge eating associated with obesity, cerebellar ataxia, and chronic headaches. 5-Hydroxy-L-tryptophan easily crosses the blood-brain barrier and effectively increases central nervous system (CNS) synthesis of serotonin. Supplementation with 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan is hypothesized to normalize serotonin synthesis, which is putatively related to its antidepressant properties (PMID: 9295177, 17240182, 16023217). When present in sufficiently high levels, 5-hydroxytryptophan can be a neurotoxin and a metabotoxin. A neurotoxin is a compound that disrupts or attacks neural cells or tissue. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Signs and symptoms of AADC deficiency generally appear in the first year of life. Affected infants may have severe developmental delay, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), muscle stiffness, difficulty moving, and involuntary writhing movements of the limbs (athetosis). They may be lacking in energy (lethargic), feed poorly, startle easily, and have sleep disturbances. Since 5-hydroxytryptophan is a precursor to serotonin, altered levels of serotonin can accumulate in the brain, which leads to abnormal neural signalling. Infants with AADC deficiency have very low levels of neural signalling molecules while individuals who consume high levels of 5-hydroxytryptophan will have very high levels of neural signalling molecules. Both conditions can lead to vomiting, nausea, extreme drowsiness, and lethargy. 5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), also known as oxitriptan (INN) is sold over-the-counter in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada as a dietary supplement for use as an antidepressant, appetite suppressant, and sleep aid. It is also marketed in many European countries for the indication of major depression under trade names such as Cincofarm, Levothym, Levotonine, Oxyfan, Telesol, Tript-OH, and Triptum. Several double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of 5-HTP in the treatment of depression, though a lack of high-quality studies has been noted. More and larger studies are needed to determine if 5-HTP is truly effective in treating depression.",5-Hydroxy-L-tryptophan,HMDB0000472,,,C01017,5-HYDROXY-TRYPTOPHAN,FDB006231,5htrp,[H]OC1=C([H])C([H])=C2N([H])C([H])=C(C2=C1[H])C([H])([H])C([H])(C([O-])=O)[N+]([H])([H])[H],"5-Hydroxytryptophan L-form***Cincofarm***L-5-Hydroxytryptophan***Levothym***Tript-OH***5-Hydroxy-L-tryptophan***Hydroxy-5 L-tryptophane***5-HTP***Hydroxytryptophan***5-Hydroxytryptophan***5 Hydroxytryptophan***5-Hydroxy- tryptophan***Oxytryptophan***Tryptophan, 5 hydroxy***(S)-5-Hydroxytryptophan***5-Hydroxyl-L-tryptophan***Levotonine***Oxyfan***Oxitriptan***Pretonine***Quietim***Serotonyl***Telesol***Triptene***Triptum***L-5-HTP",LDCYZAJDBXYCGN-UHFFFAOYSA-N,"InChI=1S/C11H12N2O3/c12-9(11(15)16)3-6-5-13-10-2-1-7(14)4-8(6)10/h1-2,4-5,9,13-14H,3,12H2,(H,15,16)"

In bacteria, 5-methylcytosine can be found at a variety of sites, and is often used as a marker to protect DNA from being cut by native methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes. In plants, 5-methylcytosine occurs at both CpG and CpNpG sequences. In fungi and animals, 5-methylcytosine predominately occurs at CpG dinucleotides.

5mthf,134-35-0,15641,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): 5 methyltetrahydrofolic acid (5-MTHF) is the most biologically active form of the B-vitamin known as folic acid, also known generically as folate. 5-MTHF functions, in concert with vitamin B12, as a methyl-group donor involved in the conversion of the amino acid homocysteine to methionine. Methyl (CH3) group donation is vital to many bodily processes, including serotonin, melatonin, and DNA synthesis. Therapeutically, 5-MTHF is instrumental in reducing homocysteine levels, preventing neural tube defects, and improving vascular endothelial function. Research on folate supplementation suggests it plays a key role in preventing cervical dysplasia and protecting against neoplasia in ulcerative colitis. Folic acid also shows promise as part of a nutritional protocol to treat vitiligo, and may reduce inflammation of the gingiva. Furthermore, certain neurological, cognitive, and psychiatric presentations may be secondary to folate deficiency. Such presentations include depression, peripheral neuropathy, myelopathy, restless legs syndrome, insomnia, dementia, forgetfulness, irritability, endogenous depression, organic psychosis, and schizophrenia-like syndromes. After ingestion, the process of conversion of folic acid to the metabolically active coenzyme forms is relatively complex. Synthesis of the active forms of folic acid requires several enzymes, adequate liver and intestinal function, and adequate supplies of riboflavin (B2), niacin (B3), pyridoxine (B6), zinc, vitamin C, and serine. After formation of the coenzyme forms of the vitamin in the liver, these metabolically active compounds are secreted into the small intestine with bile (the folate enterohepatic cycle), where they are reabsorbed and distributed to tissues throughout the body. Human pharmacokinetic studies indicate folic acid has high bioavailability, with large oral doses of folic acid substantially raising plasma levels in healthy subjects in a time and dose dependent manner. Red blood cells (RBCs) appear to be the storage depot for folic acid, as RBC levels remain elevated for periods in excess of 40 days following discontinuation of supplementation. Folic acid is poorly transported to the brain and rapidly cleared from the central nervous system. The primary methods of elimination of absorbed folic acid are fecal (through bile) and urinary. Despite the biochemical complexity of this process, evidence suggests oral supplementation with folic acid increases the body's pool of 5-MTHF in healthy individuals. However, enzyme defects, mal-absorption, digestive system pathology, and liver disease can result in impaired ability to activate folic acid. In fact, some individuals have a severe congenital deficiency of the enzyme Methyl tetrahydrofolate reductase (5-MTHFR), which is needed to convert folic acid to 5-MTHF. Milder forms of this enzyme defect likely interact with dietary folate status to determine risk for some disease conditions. In individuals with a genetic defect of this enzyme (whether mild or severe), supplementation with 5- MTHF might be preferable to folic acid supplementation.

5oxpro,98-79-3,18183,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Pyroglutamic acid (5-oxoproline) is a cyclized derivative of L-glutamic acid. It is an uncommon amino acid derivative in which the free amino group of glutamic acid cyclizes to form a lactam. It is formed nonenzymatically from glutamate, glutamine, and gamma-glutamylated peptides, but it can also be produced by the action of gamma-glutamylcyclotransferase on an L-amino acid. Elevated blood levels may be associated with problems of glutamine or glutathione metabolism. This compound is found in substantial amounts in brain tissue and other tissues in bound form, especially skin. It is also present in plant tissues. It is sold, over the counter, as a ""smart drug"" for improving blood circulation in the brain. Pyroglutamate in the urine is a biomarker for the consumption of cheese. When present in sufficiently high levels, pyroglutamic acid can act as an acidogen and a metabotoxin. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of pyroglutamic acid are associated with at least five inborn errors of metabolism including 5-oxoprolinuria, 5-oxoprolinase deficiency, glutathione synthetase deficiency, hawkinsinuria, and propionic acidemia. Pyroglutamic acid is an organic acid. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart, liver, and kidney abnormalities, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of the untreated IEMs mentioned above. Many affected children with organic acidemias experience intellectual disability or delayed development. In adults, acidosis or acidemia is characterized by headaches, confusion, feeling tired, tremors, sleepiness, and seizures.",Pyroglutamic acid,HMDB0000267,,,C01879,CPD-589,FDB014506,5oxpro,[H]N1C(=O)C([H])([H])C([H])([H])[C@@]1([H])C([O-])=O,"(-)-2-Pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic acid***(S)-(-)-2-Pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic acid***(S)-Pyroglutamic acid***5-Pyrrolidone-2-carboxylic acid***L-5-Pyrrolidone-2-carboxylic acid***L-Pyroglutamic acid***Pidolic acid***Pyroglutamate***(-)-2-Pyrrolidone-5-carboxylate***(S)-(-)-2-Pyrrolidone-5-carboxylate***(S)-Pyroglutamate***5-Pyrrolidone-2-carboxylate***L-5-Pyrrolidone-2-carboxylate***L-Pyroglutamate***Pidolate***(-)-Pyroglutamate***(-)-Pyroglutamic acid***(5S)-2-Oxopyrrolidine-5-carboxylate***(5S)-2-Oxopyrrolidine-5-carboxylic acid***(S)-(-)-g-Butyrolactam-g-carboxylate***(S)-(-)-g-Butyrolactam-g-carboxylic acid***(S)-(-)-gamma-Butyrolactam-gamma-carboxylate***(S)-(-)-gamma-Butyrolactam-gamma-carboxylic acid***(S)-2-Pyrrolidone-5-carboxylate***(S)-2-Pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic acid***(S)-5-oxo-2-Pyrrolidinecarboxylate***(S)-5-oxo-2-Pyrrolidinecarboxylic acid***2-L-Pyrrolidone-5-carboxylate***2-L-Pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic acid***2-Oxopyrrolidine-5(S)-carboxylate***2-Oxopyrrolidine-5(S)-carboxylic acid***2-Pyrrolidinone-5-carboxylate***2-Pyrrolidinone-5-carboxylic acid***5-Carboxy-2-pyrrolidinone***5-L-Oxoproline***5-oxo-L-Proline***5-Oxoproline***5-Pyrrolidinone-2-carboxylate***5-Pyrrolidinone-2-carboxylic acid***Ajidew a 100***Glutimate***Glutimic acid***Glutiminate***Glutiminic acid***L-2-Pyrrolidone-5-carboxylate***L-2-Pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic acid***L-5-Carboxy-2-pyrrolidinone***L-5-oxo-2-Pyrrolidinecarboxylate***L-5-oxo-2-Pyrrolidinecarboxylic acid***L-5-Oxoproline***L-Glutamic acid g-lactam***L-Glutimate***L-Glutimic acid***L-Glutiminate***L-Glutiminic acid***L-Pyrrolidinonecarboxylate***L-Pyrrolidinonecarboxylic acid***L-Pyrrolidonecarboxylate***L-Pyrrolidonecarboxylic acid***Oxoproline***Oxopyrrolidinecarboxylate***Oxopyrrolidinecarboxylic acid***Pidolidone***Pyrrolidinonecarboxylate***Pyrrolidinonecarboxylic acid***Pyrrolidone-5-carboxylate***Pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic acid***Pyrrolidonecarboxylic acid***5-Ketoproline***Pidolate, magnesium***5-Oxopyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid***Magnesium pidolate",ODHCTXKNWHHXJC-VKHMYHEASA-M,"InChI=1S/C5H7NO3/c7-4-2-1-3(6-4)5(8)9/h3H,1-2H2,(H,6,7)(H,8,9)/p-1/t3-/m0/s1"

aa,,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Acrylamide (ACR) is a chemical used in many industries around the world and more recently was found to form naturally in foods cooked at high temperatures. Acrylamide is a neurotoxicant, reproductive toxicant, and carcinogen in animal species. Only the neurotoxic effects have been observed in humans and only at high levels of exposure in occupational settings. The mechanism underlying neurotoxic effects of ACR may be basic to the other toxic effects seen in animals. This mechanism involves interference with the kinesin-related motor proteins in nerve cells or with fusion proteins in the formation of vesicles at the nerve terminus and eventual cell death. Neurotoxicity and resulting behavioral changes can affect reproductive performance of ACR-exposed laboratory animals with resulting decreased reproductive performance. Further, the kinesin motor proteins are important in sperm motility, which could alter reproduction parameters. Effects on kinesin proteins could also explain some of the genotoxic effects on ACR. These proteins form the spindle fibers in the nucleus that function in the separation of chromosomes during cell division. This could explain the clastogenic effects of the chemical noted in a number of tests for genotoxicity and assays for germ cell damage. Other mechanisms underlying ACR-induced carcinogenesis or nerve toxicity are likely related to an affinity for sulfhydryl groups on proteins. Binding of the sulfhydryl groups could inactive proteins/enzymes involved in DNA repair and other critical cell functions. Direct interaction with DNA may or may not be a major mechanism for cancer induction in animals. The DNA adducts that form do not correlate with tumor sites and ACR is mostly negative in gene mutation assays except at high doses that may not be achievable in the diet. All epidemiologic studies fail to show any increased risk of cancer from either high-level occupational exposure or the low levels found in the diet. In fact, two of the epidemiologic studies show a decrease in cancer of the large bowel. A number of risk assessment studies were performed to estimate increased cancer risk. The results of these studies are highly variable depending on the model. There is universal consensus among international food safety groups in all countries that examined the issue of ACR in the diet that not enough information is available at this time to make informed decisions on which to base any regulatory action. Too little is known about levels of this chemical in different foods and the potential risk from dietary exposure. Avoidance of foods containing ACR would result in worse health issues from an unbalanced diet or pathogens from under cooked foods. There is some consensus that low levels of ACR in the diet are not a concern for neurotoxicity or reproductive toxicity in humans, although further research is need to study the long-term, low-level cumulative effects on the nervous system. Any relationship to cancer risk from dietary exposure is hypothetical at this point and awaits more definitive studies. (PMID: 17492525).",Acrylamide,HMDB0004296,,,,,,,,,,

abt_D,,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): D-Arabitol is a polyol. Polyols are sugar alcohols linked to the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). They are classified on the basis of the number of carbon atoms. Polyols occur in body fluids. A patient with leukoencephalopathy and peripheral neuropathy has been identified as suffering from ribose-5-phosphate isomerase (RPI) deficiency, a defect in the PPP. In this disorder, highly elevated concentrations of the C5 polyols such as D-arabitol are found in body fluids. In addition, transaldolase deficiency, another defect in the PPP, has been diagnosed in a patient with mainly liver problems among others. This patient had increased concentrations of polyols, mainly D-arabitol. So far, the pathophysiological role of polyols is relatively unknown. It is thought that D-arabitol is a metabolic end-product in humans. The strong brain-CSF-plasma gradient of polyols in the patient with RPI deficiency suggested a primary metabolic disorder. The mechanisms of brain and neuronal damage in RPI deficiency remain to be elucidated. A neurotoxic effect due to the accumulation of the polyols may play a role.

Persistent mild hyperketonemia is a common finding in newborns. These compounds serve as an indispensable source of energy for extrahepatic tissues, especially the brain and lung of developing rats. Another important function of ketone bodies is to provide acetoacetyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA for synthesis of cholesterol, fatty acids, and complex lipids. During the early postnatal period, acetoacetate (AcAc) and beta-hydroxybutyrate are preferred over glucose as substrates for synthesis of phospholipids and sphingolipids in accord with requirements for brain growth and myelination. Thus, during the first 2 wk of postnatal development, when the accumulation of cholesterol and phospholipids accelerates, the proportion of ketone bodies incorporated into these lipids increases. On the other hand, an increased proportion of ketone bodies are utilized for cerebroside synthesis during the period of active myelination. In the lung, AcAc serves better than glucose as a precursor for the synthesis of lung phospholipids. The synthesized lipids, particularly dipalmityl phosphatidylcholine, are incorporated into surfactant, and thus have a potential role in supplying adequate surfactant lipids to maintain lung function during the early days of life.

However, its physiological role in biochemical machinery is not clear. A model for the role of acetone metabolism is presented that orders the events occurring in acetonemia in sequence: in diabetic ketosis or starvation, ketone body production (b-hydroxy-butyrate, acetoacetate) provides fuel for vital organs (heart, brain .) raising the chance of survival of the metabolic catastrophe. However, when ketone body production exceeds the degrading capacity, the accumulating acetoacetic acid presents a new challenge to the pH regulatory system. Acetone production and its further degradation to C3 fragments fulfill two purposes: the maintenance of pH buffering capacity and provision of fuel for peripheral tissues. Since ketosis develops under serious metabolic circumstances, all the mechanisms that balance or moderate the effects of ketosis enhance the chance for survival. From this point of view, the theory that transportable C3 fragments can serve as additional nutrients is a novel view of acetone metabolism which introduces a new approach to the study of acetone degradation, especially in understanding its physiological function and the interrelationship between liver and peripheral tissues.

acgam,7512-17-6,506227,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): N-Acetyl-D-Glucosamine (N-acetlyglucosamine) is a monosaccharide derivative of glucose. Chemically it is an amide between glucosamine and acetic acid. A single N-acetlyglucosamine moiety linked to serine or threonine residues on nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins -O-GlcNAc, is an ubiquitous post-translational protein modification. O-GlcNAc modified proteins are involved in sensing the nutrient status of the surrounding cellular environment and adjusting the activity of cellular proteins accordingly. O-GlcNAc regulates cellular responses to hormones such as insulin, initiates a protective response to stress, modulates a cell's capacity to grow and divide, and regulates gene transcription. In humans, it exists in skin, cartilage and blood vessel as a component of hyaluronic acid, and bone tissue, cornea and aorta as a component of keratan sulfate.

ach,51-84-3,15355,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Acetylcholine (ACh) is a neurotransmitter. Acetylcholine in vertebrates is the major transmitter at neuromuscular junctions, autonomic ganglia, parasympathetic effector junctions, a subset of sympathetic effector junctions, and at many sites in the central nervous system. Its physiological and pharmacological effects, metabolism, release, and receptors have been well documented in several species. ACh has been considered an important excitatory neurotransmitter in the carotid body (CB). Various nicotinic and muscarinic ACh receptors are present in both afferent nerve endings and glomus cells. Therefore, ACh can depolarize or hyperpolarize the cell membrane depending on the available receptor type in the vicinity. Binding of ACh to its receptor can create a wide variety of cellular responses including opening cation channels (nicotinic ACh receptor activation), releasing Ca2+ from intracellular storage sites (via muscarinic ACh receptors), and modulating activities of K+ and Ca2+ channels. Interactions between ACh and other neurotransmitters (dopamine, adenosine, nitric oxide) have been known, and they may induce complicated responses. Cholinergic biology in the CB differs among species and even within the same species due to different genetic composition. Development and environment influence cholinergic biology. Pharmacological data clearly indicate that both muscarinic and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors have a role in the encoding of new memories. Localized lesions and antagonist infusions demonstrate the anatomical locus of these cholinergic effects, and computational modeling links the function of cholinergic modulation to specific cellular effects within these regions. Acetylcholine has been shown to increase the strength of afferent input relative to feedback, to contribute to theta rhythm oscillations, activate intrinsic mechanisms for persistent spiking, and increase the modification of synapses. These effects might enhance different types of encoding in different cortical structures. In particular, the effects in entorhinal and perirhinal cortex and hippocampus might be important for encoding new episodic memories. The role of ACh in attention has been repeatedly demonstrated in several tasks. Acetylcholine is linked to response accuracy in voluntary and reflexive attention and also to response speed in reflexive attention. It is well known that those with Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders tend to be inaccurate and slow to respond.

acmp,103-90-2,46195,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): The excellent tolerability of therapeutic doses of paracetamol (acetaminophen) is a major factor in the very wide use of the drug. The major problem in the use of paracetamol is its hepatotoxicity after an overdose. Hepatotoxicity has also been reported after therapeutic doses, but critical analysis indicates that most patients with alleged toxicity from therapeutic doses have taken overdoses. Importantly, prospective studies indicate that therapeutic doses of paracetamol are an unlikely cause of hepatotoxicity in patients who ingest moderate to large amounts of alcohol (PMID: 15733027). Single doses of paracetamol are effective analgesics for acute postoperative pain and give rise to few adverse effects (PMID: 14974073). Acetaminophen (AAP) overdose and the resulting hepatotoxicity is an important clinical problem. In addition, AAP is widely used as a prototype hepatotoxin to study mechanisms of chemical-induced cell injury and to test the hepatoprotective potential of new drugs and herbal medicines. Because of its importance, the mechanisms of AAP-induced liver cell injury have been extensively investigated and controversially discussed for many years (PMID:

acnam,131-48-6,45744,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuAc) or sialic acid is an acetyl derivative of the amino sugar neuraminic acid. It occurs in many glycoproteins, glycolipids, and polysaccharides in both mammals and bacteria. The most abundant sialic acid, NeuAc, is synthesized in vivo from N-acetylated D-mannosamine (ManNAc) or D-glucosamine (GlcNAc). NeuAc and its activated form, CMP-NeuAc, are biosynthesized in five consecutive reactions: UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) ManNAc 6-phosphate NeuAc 9-phosphate NeuAc CMP-NeuAc. CMP-NeuAc is transported into the Golgi apparatus and, with the aid of specific sialyltransferases, added onto nonreducing positions on oligosaccharide chains of glycoproteins and glycolipids. NeuAc is widely distributed throughout human tissues and found in several fluids, including serum, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, urine, amniotic fluid, and breast milk. It is found in high levels in the brain, adrenal glands, and the heart. Serum and urine levels of the free acid are elevated in individuals suffering from renal failure. Serum and saliva Neu5Ac levels are also elevated in alcoholics. A genetic disorder known as Salla disease or infantile NeuAc storage disease is also characterized by high serum and urine levels of this compound. The negative charge of is responsible for the slippery feel of saliva and mucins coating the body's organs. This particular sialic acid is known to act as a ""decoy"" for invading pathogens. Along with involvement in preventing infections (mucus associated with mucous membranes — mouth, nose, GI, respiratory tract), Neu5Ac acts as a receptor for influenza viruses, allowing attachment to mucous cells via hemagglutinin (an early step in acquiring influenzavirus infection). NeuAc is also becoming known as an agent necessary for mediating ganglioside distribution and structures in the brain. Sialic acid (SA) is an N-acetylated derivative of neuraminic acid that is an abundant terminal monosaccharide of glycoconjugates. Normal human serum SA is largely bound to glycoproteins or glycolipids (Total sialic acid, TSA, 1.5-2.5 mmol/L), with small amounts of free SA (1-3 umol/L). Negatively charged SA units stabilize glycoprotein conformation in cell surface receptors to increase cell rigidity. This enables signal recognition and adhesion to ligands, antibodies, enzymes and microbes. SA residues are antigenic determinant residues in carbohydrate chains of glycolipids and glycoproteins, chemical messengers in tissue and body fluids, and may regulate glomeruli basement membrane permeability. Sialic acids are structurally unique nine-carbon keto sugars occupying the interface between the host and commensal or pathogenic microorganisms. An important function of host sialic acid is to regulate innate immunity. Sialic acid is the moiety most actively recycled for metabolic purposes in the salvage pathways in glycosphingolipid metabolism. Sialic acid is indispensable for the neuritogenic activities of gangliosides constituents which are unique in that a sialic acid directly binds to the glucose of the cerebroside, they are mutually connected in tandem, and some are located in the internal parts of the sugar chain. Sialylation (sialic acid linked to galactose, N-acetylgalactosamine, or linked to another sialic acid) represents one of the most frequently occurring terminations of the oligosaccharide chains of glycoproteins and glycolipids. The biosynthesis of the various linkages is mediated by the different members of the sialyltransferase family (PMID: 11425186 , 11287396 , 12770781 , 16624269 , 12510390 , 15007099 ).",N-Acetylneuraminic acid,HMDB0000230,,,C19910,N-ACETYLNEURAMINATE,FDB001209,acnam,[H]OC([H])([H])[C@@]([H])(O[H])[C@@]([H])(O[H])[C@]1([H])O[C@](O[H])(C([O-])=O)C([H])([H])[C@]([H])(O[H])[C@@]1([H])N([H])C(=O)C([H])([H])[H],"5-N-ACETYL-BETA-D-neuraminIC ACID***beta-Neu5ac***5-N-ACETYL-b-D-neuraminate***5-N-ACETYL-b-D-neuraminic acid***5-N-ACETYL-beta-D-neuraminate***5-N-ACETYL-β-D-neuraminate***5-N-ACETYL-β-D-neuraminic acid***N-Acetylneuraminate***b-Neu5ac***β-neu5ac***5-(acetylamino)-3,5-Dideoxy-D-glycero-b-D-galacto-2-nonulopyranosonate***5-(acetylamino)-3,5-Dideoxy-D-glycero-b-D-galacto-2-nonulopyranosonic acid***5-(acetylamino)-3,5-Dideoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-2-nonulosonate***5-(acetylamino)-3,5-Dideoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-2-nonulosonic acid***5-(acetylamino)-3,5-Dideoxy-delta-glycero-beta-delta-galacto-2-nonulopyranosonate***5-(acetylamino)-3,5-Dideoxy-delta-glycero-beta-delta-galacto-2-nonulopyranosonic acid***5-(acetylamino)-3,5-Dideoxy-delta-glycero-delta-galacto-2-nonulosonate***5-(acetylamino)-3,5-Dideoxy-delta-glycero-delta-galacto-2-nonulosonic acid***5-acetamido-3,5-Dideoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-nonulosonate***5-acetamido-3,5-Dideoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-nonulosonic acid***5-acetamido-3,5-Dideoxy-delta-glycero-delta-galacto-nonulosonate***5-acetamido-3,5-Dideoxy-delta-glycero-delta-galacto-nonulosonic acid***5-N-Acetyl-beta-delta-neuraminic acid***5-N-Acetyl-D-neuraminate***5-N-Acetyl-D-neuraminic acid***5-N-Acetyl-delta-neuraminate***5-N-Acetyl-delta-neuraminic acid***5-N-Acetylneuraminate***5-N-Acetylneuraminic acid***Aceneuramate***Aceneuramic acid***Acetylneuraminate***Acetylneuraminic acid***b-5-acetamido-3,5-Dideoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-nonulopyranosonate***b-5-acetamido-3,5-Dideoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-nonulopyranosonic acid***b-Sialic acid***beta-5-acetamido-3,5-Dideoxy-delta-glycero-delta-galacto-nonulopyranosonate***beta-5-acetamido-3,5-Dideoxy-delta-glycero-delta-galacto-nonulopyranosonic acid***beta-Sialic acid***Lactaminate***Lactaminic acid***N-Acetyl-b-D-neuraminate***N-Acetyl-b-D-neuraminic acid***N-Acetyl-b-neuraminate***N-Acetyl-beta-delta-neuraminate***N-Acetyl-beta-delta-neuraminic acid***N-Acetyl-beta-neuraminate***N-Acetyl-D-neuraminate***N-Acetyl-D-neuraminic acid***N-Acetyl-delta-neuraminate***N-Acetyl-delta-neuraminic acid***N-Acetyl-neuraminate***N-Acetyl-neuraminic acid***N-Acetylneuramate***N-Acetylneuramic acid***N-Acetylsialate***N-Acetylsialic acid***NAN***NANA***Neu5ac***Sialic acid***Acid, sialic***Acid, N-acetylneuraminic***N Acetylneuraminic acid",SQVRNKJHWKZAKO-PFQGKNLYSA-M,"InChI=1S/C11H19NO9/c1-4(14)12-7-5(15)2-11(20,10(18)19)21-9(7)8(17)6(16)3-13/h5-9,13,15-17,20H,2-3H2,1H3,(H,12,14)(H,18,19)/p-1/t5-,6+,7+,8+,9+,11-/m0/s1"

adn,58-61-7,16335,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Adenosine is a nucleoside that is composed of adenine and D-ribose. Adenosine or adenosine derivatives play many important biological roles in addition to being components of DNA and RNA. For instance, adenosine plays an important role in energy transfer as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). It also plays a role in signal transduction as cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Adenosine itself is both a neurotransmitter and potent vasodilator. When administered intravenously adenosine causes transient heart block in the AV node. Due to the effects of adenosine on AV node-dependent supraventricular tachycardia, adenosine is considered a class V antiarrhythmic agent. Overdoses of adenosine intake (as a drug) can lead to several side effects including chest pain, feeling faint, shortness of breath, and tingling of the senses. Serious side effects include a worsening dysrhythmia and low blood pressure. When present in sufficiently high levels, adenosine can act as an immunotoxin and a metabotoxin. An immunotoxin disrupts, limits the function, or destroys immune cells. A metabotoxin is an endogenous metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of adenosine are associated with adenosine deaminase deficiency. Adenosine is a precursor to deoxyadenosine, which is a precursor to dATP. A buildup of dATP in cells inhibits ribonucleotide reductase and prevents DNA synthesis, so cells are unable to divide. Since developing T cells and B cells are some of the most mitotically active cells, they are unable to divide and propagate to respond to immune challenges. High levels of deoxyadenosine also lead to an increase in S-adenosylhomocysteine, which is toxic to immature lymphocytes.",Adenosine,HMDB0000050,,,C00212,ADENOSINE,FDB003554,adn,[H]OC([H])([H])[C@@]1([H])O[C@@]([H])(N2C([H])=NC3=C(N=C([H])N=C23)N([H])[H])[C@]([H])(O[H])[C@]1([H])O[H],"(2R,3R,4S,5R)-2-(6-Aminopurin-9-yl)-5-(hydroxymethyl)oxolane-3,4-diol***6-amino-9-beta-D-Ribofuranosyl-9H-purine***9-beta-D-Ribofuranosidoadenine***9-beta-D-Ribofuranosyl-9H-purin-6-amine***Ade-rib***Adenine deoxyribonucleoside***Adenocard***Adenocor***Adenoscan***Adenosin***Adenyldeoxyriboside***Ado***beta-D-Adenosine***Deoxyadenosine***Desoxyadenosine***6-amino-9-b-D-Ribofuranosyl-9H-purine***6-amino-9-β-D-ribofuranosyl-9H-purine***9-b-D-Ribofuranosidoadenine***9-β-D-ribofuranosidoadenine***9-b-D-Ribofuranosyl-9H-purin-6-amine***9-β-D-ribofuranosyl-9H-purin-6-amine***b-D-Adenosine***β-D-adenosine***1-(6-amino-9H-Purin-9-yl)-1-deoxy-beta-D-ribofuranose***1-(6-amino-9H-Purin-9-yl)-1-deoxy-beta-delta-ribofuranose***6-amino-9beta-D-Ribofuranosyl-9H-purine***6-amino-9beta-delta-Ribofuranosyl-9H-purine***9-beta-D-Arabinofuranosyladenine***9-beta-D-Ribofuranosyladenine***9-beta-delta-Arabinofuranosyladenine***9-beta-delta-Ribofuranosidoadenine***9-beta-delta-Ribofuranosyl-9H-purin-6-amine***9-beta-delta-Ribofuranosyladenine***9beta-D-Ribofuranosyl-9H-purin-6-amine***9beta-D-Ribofuranosyladenine***9beta-delta-Ribofuranosyl-9H-purin-6-amine***9beta-delta-Ribofuranosyladenine***Adenine nucleoside***Adenine riboside***Adenine-9beta-D-ribofuranoside***Adenine-9beta-delta-ribofuranoside***beta-Adenosine***beta-delta-Adenosine***Boniton***Myocol***Nucleocardyl***Sandesin",OIRDTQYFTABQOQ-KQYNXXCUSA-N,"InChI=1S/C10H13N5O4/c11-8-5-9(13-2-12-8)15(3-14-5)10-7(18)6(17)4(1-16)19-10/h2-4,6-7,10,16-18H,1H2,(H2,11,12,13)/t4-,6-,7-,10-/m1/s1"

PARP is found in every cell nucleus. Its main role is to detect and signal single-strand DNA breaks (SSB) to the enzymatic machinery involved in the SSB repair. PARP activation is an immediate cellular response to metabolic, chemical, or radiation-induced DNA SSB damage. Once PARP detects a SSB, it binds to the DNA, and, after a structural change, begins the synthesis of a poly (ADP-ribose) chain (PAR) as a signal for the other DNA-repairing enzymes such as DNA ligase III (LigIII), DNA polymerase beta, and scaffolding proteins such as X-ray cross-complementing gene 1 (XRCC1). After repairing, the PAR chains are degraded via PAR glycohydrolase (PARG). ADP-ribose binds to and activates the TRPM2 ion channel. Adenosine diphosphate ribose is an intermediate in NAD metabolism. The enzyme NAD(P)+ nucleosidase [EC:3.2.2.6] catalyzes the production of this metabolite from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate.

ahcys,979-92-0,16680,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): S-Adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH) is formed by the demethylation of S-adenosyl-L-methionine. S-Adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy or SAH) is also the immediate precursor of all of the homocysteine produced in the body. The reaction is catalyzed by S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase and is reversible with the equilibrium favoring formation of SAH. In vivo, the reaction is driven in the direction of homocysteine formation by the action of the enzyme adenosine deaminase which converts the second product of the S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase reaction, adenosine, to inosine. Except for methyl transfer from betaine and from methylcobalamin in the methionine synthase reaction, SAH is the product of all methylation reactions that involve S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) as the methyl donor. Methylation is significant in epigenetic regulation of protein expression via DNA and histone methylation. The inhibition of these SAM-mediated processes by SAH is a proven mechanism for metabolic alteration. Because the conversion of SAH to homocysteine is reversible, with the equilibrium favoring the formation of SAH, increases in plasma homocysteine are accompanied by an elevation of SAH in most cases. Disturbances in the transmethylation pathway indicated by abnormal SAH, SAM, or their ratio have been reported in many neurodegenerative diseases, such as dementia, depression, and Parkinson's disease (PMID: 18065573, 17892439). Therefore, when present in sufficiently high levels, S-adenosylhomocysteine can act as an immunotoxin and a metabotoxin. An immunotoxin disrupts, limits the function, or destroys immune cells. A metabotoxin is an endogenous metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of S-adenosylhomocysteine are associated with S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) hydrolase deficiency and adenosine deaminase deficiency. S-Adenosylhomocysteine forms when there are elevated levels of homocysteine and adenosine. S-Adenosyl-L-homocysteine is a potent inhibitor of S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methylation reactions. It is toxic to immature lymphocytes and can lead to immunosuppression (PMID: 221926).",S-Adenosylhomocysteine,HMDB0000939,,,C00021,ADENOSYL-HOMO-CYS,FDB022327,ahcys,[H]O[C@@]1([H])[C@@]([H])(O[C@]([H])(C([H])([H])SC([H])([H])C([H])([H])[C@@]([H])(C([O-])=O)[N+]([H])([H])[H])[C@@]1([H])O[H])N1C([H])=NC2=C(N=C([H])N=C12)N([H])[H],"(2S)-2-amino-4-({[(2S,3S,4R,5R)-5-(6-amino-9H-purin-9-yl)-3,4-dihydroxytetrahydrofuran-2-yl]methyl}sulfanyl)butanoic acid***2-S-Adenosyl-L-homocysteine***Adenosyl-L-homocysteine***Adenosylhomocysteine***AdoHcy***S-(5'-Adenosyl)-L-homocysteine***S-[1-(Adenin-9-yl)-1,5-dideoxy-beta-D-ribofuranos-5-yl]-L-homocysteine***SAH***(2S)-2-amino-4-({[(2S,3S,4R,5R)-5-(6-amino-9H-purin-9-yl)-3,4-dihydroxytetrahydrofuran-2-yl]methyl}sulfanyl)butanoate***(2S)-2-amino-4-({[(2S,3S,4R,5R)-5-(6-amino-9H-purin-9-yl)-3,4-dihydroxytetrahydrofuran-2-yl]methyl}sulphanyl)butanoate***(2S)-2-amino-4-({[(2S,3S,4R,5R)-5-(6-amino-9H-purin-9-yl)-3,4-dihydroxytetrahydrofuran-2-yl]methyl}sulphanyl)butanoic acid***S-[1-(Adenin-9-yl)-1,5-dideoxy-b-D-ribofuranos-5-yl]-L-homocysteine***S-[1-(Adenin-9-yl)-1,5-dideoxy-β-D-ribofuranos-5-yl]-L-homocysteine***(S)-5'-(S)-(3-amino-3-Carboxypropyl)-5'-thioadenosine***5'-Deoxy-S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine***5'-S-(3-amino-3-Carboxypropyl)-5'-thio-L-adenosine***Adenosyl-homo-cys***adenosylhomo-CYS***Formycinylhomocysteine***L-5'-S-(3-amino-3-Carboxypropyl)-5'-thior-adenosine***L-S-Adenosyl-homocysteine***L-S-Adenosylhomocysteine***S-(5'-Deoxyadenosin-5'-yl)-L-homocysteine***S-(5'-Deoxyadenosine-5')-L-homocysteine***S-Adenosyl-homocysteine***S-Adenosyl-L-homocysteine***Adenosylhomocysteine, S***S Adenosylhomocysteine",ZJUKTBDSGOFHSH-WFMPWKQPSA-N,"InChI=1S/C14H20N6O5S/c15-6(14(23)24)1-2-26-3-7-9(21)10(22)13(25-7)20-5-19-8-11(16)17-4-18-12(8)20/h4-7,9-10,13,21-22H,1-3,15H2,(H,23,24)(H2,16,17,18)/t6-,7+,9+,10+,13+/m0/s1"
ahdt,20574-65-6,18372,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): The biosynthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) from dihydroneopterin triphosphate (NH2P3) was studied in human liver extract. The phosphate-eliminating enzyme (PEE) was purified approximately 750-fold. The conversion of NH2P3 to BH4 was catalyzed by this enzyme in the presence of partially purified sepiapterin reductase, Mg2+ and NADPH. The PEE is heat stable when heated at 80 degrees C for 5 min. It has a molecular weight of 63 000 daltons. One possible intermediate 6-(1'-hydroxy-2'-oxopropyl)5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin(2'-oxo-tetrahydropte rin) was formed upon incubation of BH4 in the presence of sepiapterin reductase and NADP+ at pH 9.0. Reduction of this compound with NaBD4 yielded monodeutero threo and erythro-BH4, the deuterium was incorporated at the 2' position. This and the UV spectra were consistent with a 2'-oxo-tetrahydropterin structure. Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) catalyzed the reduction of BH2 to BH4 and was found to be specific for the pro-R-NADPH side. The sepiapterin reductase catalyzed the transfer of the pro-S hydrogen of NADPH during the reduction of sepiapterin to BH2. In the presence of crude liver extracts the conversion of NH2P3 to BH4 requires NADPH. Two deuterium atoms were incorporated from (4S-2H)NADHP in the 1' and 2' position of the BH4 side chain. Incorporation of one hydrogen from the solvent was found at position C(6). These results are consistent with the occurrence of an intramolecular redox exchange between the pteridine nucleus and the side chain and formation of 6-pyruvoyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin(tetrahydro-1'-2'-dioxopterin) as intermediate.

ak2lgchol_hs,,560225,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): 1-Octadecyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine is an intermediate in the ether lipid metabolism pathway. 1-Octadecyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine is irreversibly produced from 2-acetyl-1-(9Z-octadecenyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine via the enzyme 1-alkyl-2-acetylglycerophosphocholine esterase (EC 3.1.1.47). 1-Octadecyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine is an ether phospho-ether lipid. Ether lipids are lipids in which one or more of the carbon atoms on glycerol are bonded to an alkyl chain via an ether linkage, as opposed to the usual ester linkage. Plasmalogens are glycerol ether phospholipids. They are of two types, alkyl ether (-O-CH2-) and alkenyl ether (-O-CH=CH-). Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) serves as the glycerol precursor for the synthesis of plasmalogens. Three major classes of plasmalogens have been identified: choline, ethanolamine and serine derivatives. Ethanolamine plasmalogen is prevalent in myelin. Choline plasmalogen is abundant in cardiac tissue. Usually, the highest proportion of the plasmalogen form is in the ethanolamine class with rather less in choline, and commonly little or none in other phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol. In choline plasmalogens of most tissues, a higher proportion is often of the O-alkyl rather than the O-alkenyl form, but the reverse tends to be true in heart lipids. In animal tissues, the alkyl and alkenyl moieties in both non-polar and phospholipids tend to be rather simple in composition with 16:0, 18:0 and 18:1 (double bond in position 9) predominating. Ether analogues of triacylglycerols, i.e. 1-alkyldiacyl-sn-glycerols, are present at trace levels only if at all in most animal tissues, but they can be major components of some marine lipids.",LysoPC(O-18:0),HMDB0011149,,,C04317,,FDB027924,ak2lgchol_hs,[H]O[C@]([H])(C([H])([H])O[*])C([H])([H])OP(=O)(O[H])OC([H])([H])C([H])([H])[N+](C([H])([H])[H])(C([H])([H])[H])C([H])([H])[H],1-O-Octadecylglycerol-3-phosphatidylcholine***1-Octadecyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine***LPC (O-18:0)***LysoPC(18:0E/0:0)***PC(O-18:0/0:0)***LysoPC(DM18:0)***LysoPC(O-18:0/0:0),XKBJVQHMEXMFDZ-AREMUKBSSA-N,

akg,328-50-7,30915,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Oxoglutaric acid, also known as alpha-ketoglutarate, alpha-ketoglutaric acid, AKG or 2-Oxoglutaric acid, is classified as a gamma-keto acid or a Gamma-keto acid derivative. Gamma-keto acids are organic compounds containing an aldehyde substituted with a keto group on the C4 carbon atom. Alpha-ketoglutarate is considered to be soluble (in water) and acidic. Alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG) is a key molecule in the Krebs, TCA or citric acid cycle, playing a fundamental role in determining the overall rate of this important metabolic process (PMID: 26759695). In the TCA cycle, AKG is decarboxylated to succinyl-CoA and carbon dioxide by AKG dehydrogenase, which functions as a key control point of the TCA cycle. Additionally, AKG can be generated from isocitrate by oxidative decarboxylation catalyzed by the enzyme known as isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH). In addition to these routes of production, AKG can be produced from glutamate by oxidative deamination via glutamate dehydrogenase, and as a product of pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transamination reactions (mediated by branched-chain amino acid transaminases) in which glutamate is a common amino donor. AKG is a nitrogen scavenger and a source of glutamate and glutamine that stimulates protein synthesis and inhibits protein degradation in muscles. In particular, AKG can decrease protein catabolism and increase protein synthesis to enhance bone tissue formation in skeletal muscles (PMID: 26759695). Interestingly, enteric feeding of AKG supplements can significantly increase circulating plasma levels of such hormones as insulin, growth hormone and insulin like growth factor-1 (PMID: 26759695). It has recently been shown that AKG can extend the lifespan of adult C. elegans by inhibiting ATP synthase and TOR (PMID: 24828042). In combination with molecular oxygen, alpha-ketoglutarate is required for the hydroxylation of proline to hydroxyproline in the production of Type 1 collagen. A recent study has shown that α-ketoglutarate promotes TH1 differentiation along with the depletion of glutamine thereby favoring Treg (regulatory T-cell) differentiation (PMID: 26420908). Alpha-ketoglutarate has been found to be associated with fumarase deficiency, 2-Ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex deficiency and D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria which is an inborn error of metabolism (PMID: 8338207).",Oxoglutaric acid,HMDB0000208,,,C00026,2-KETOGLUTARATE,FDB003361,akg,[H]C([H])(C([O-])=O)C([H])([H])C(=O)C([O-])=O,"2-Ketoglutaric acid***alpha-Ketoglutaric acid***2-Ketoglutarate***Oxoglutarate***a-Ketoglutarate***a-Ketoglutaric acid***alpha-Ketoglutarate***α-ketoglutarate***α-ketoglutaric acid***2-oxo-1,5-Pentanedioate***2-oxo-1,5-Pentanedioic acid***2-Oxoglutarate***2-Oxoglutaric acid***2-Oxopentanedioate***2-Oxopentanedioic acid***alpha-Ketoglutaric acid, calcium salt (2:1)***alpha-Ketoglutaric acid, sodium salt***Calcium alpha-ketoglutarate***alpha-Ketoglutaric acid, disodium salt***alpha-Ketoglutaric acid, monosodium salt***Calcium ketoglutarate***alpha-Ketoglutaric acid, diammonium salt***alpha-Ketoglutaric acid, dipotassium salt***alpha-Ketoglutaric acid, monopotassium salt***alpha-Ketoglutaric acid, potassium salt***alpha-Oxoglutarate",KPGXRSRHYNQIFN-UHFFFAOYSA-L,"InChI=1S/C5H6O5/c6-3(5(9)10)1-2-4(7)8/h1-2H2,(H,7,8)(H,9,10)/p-2"

ala_B,107-95-9,16958,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): beta-Alanine is the only naturally occurring beta-amino acid - an amino acid in which the amino group is at the beta-position from the carboxylate group. It is formed in vivo by the degradation of dihydrouracil and carnosine. It is a component of the naturally occurring peptides carnosine and anserine and also of pantothenic acid (vitamin B-5), which itself is a component of coenzyme A. Under normal conditions, beta-alanine is metabolized into acetic acid. beta-Alanine can undergo a transanimation reaction with pyruvate to form malonate-semialdehyde and L-alanine. The malonate semialdehyde can then be converted into malonate via malonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase. Malonate is then converted into malonyl-CoA and enter fatty acid biosynthesis. Since neuronal uptake and neuronal receptor sensitivity to beta-alanine have been demonstrated, beta-alanine may act as a false transmitter replacing gamma-aminobutyric acid. When present in sufficiently high levels, beta-alanine can act as a neurotoxin, a mitochondrial toxin, and a metabotoxin. A neurotoxin is a compound that damages the brain or nerve tissue. A mitochondrial toxin is a compound that damages mitochondria and reduces cellular respiration as well as oxidative phosphorylation. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of beta-alanine are associated with at least three inborn errors of metabolism, including GABA-transaminase deficiency, hyper-beta-alaninemia, and methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency. beta-Alanine is a central nervous system (CNS) depressant and is an inhibitor of GABA transaminase. The associated inhibition of GABA transaminase and displacement of GABA from CNS binding sites can also lead to GABAuria (high levels of GABA in the urine) and convulsions. In addition to its neurotoxicity, beta-alanine reduces cellular levels of taurine, which are required for normal respiratory chain function. Cellular taurine depletion is known to reduce respiratory function and elevate mitochondrial superoxide generation, which damages mitochondria and increases oxidative stress (PMID: 27023909). Individuals suffering from mitochondrial defects or mitochondrial toxicity typically develop neurotoxicity, hypotonia, respiratory distress, and cardiac failure. beta-Alanine is a biomarker for the consumption of meat, especially red meat.",beta-Alanine,HMDB0000056,,,C00099,B-ALANINE,FDB002253,ala_B,[H][N+]([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([O-])=O,3-Aminopropanoic acid***3-Aminopropionic acid***BAla***beta-Aminopropionic acid***H-beta-Ala-OH***Omega-aminopropionic acid***3-Aminopropanoate***b-Alanine***β-alanine***3-Aminopropionate***b-Aminopropionate***b-Aminopropionic acid***beta-Aminopropionate***β-aminopropionate***β-aminopropionic acid***H-b-Ala-OH***H-β-ala-OH***Omega-aminopropionate***2-Carboxyethylamine***3-amino-Propanoate***3-amino-Propanoic acid***Abufene***b-Aminopropanoate***b-Aminopropanoic acid***beta Alanine***beta-Aminopropanoate***beta-Aminopropanoic acid***3 Aminopropionic acid,UCMIRNVEIXFBKS-UHFFFAOYSA-N,"InChI=1S/C3H7NO2/c4-2-1-3(5)6/h1-2,4H2,(H,5,6)"

Bile acids are physiological detergents that facilitate excretion, absorption, and transport of fats and sterols in the intestine and liver. Bile acids are also steroidal amphipathic molecules derived from the catabolism of cholesterol. They modulate bile flow and lipid secretion, are essential for the absorption of dietary fats and vitamins, and have been implicated in the regulation of all the key enzymes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Bile acids recirculate through the liver, bile ducts, small intestine and portal vein to form an enterohepatic circuit. They exist as anions at physiological pH and, consequently, require a carrier for transport across the membranes of the enterohepatic tissues. The unique detergent properties of bile acids are essential for the digestion and intestinal absorption of hydrophobic nutrients.

Aldosterone increases the permeability of the apical (luminal) membrane of the kidney's collecting ducts to potassium and sodium and activates their basolateral Na+/K+ pumps, stimulating ATP hydrolysis, reabsorbing sodium (Na+) ions and water into the blood, and excreting potassium (K+) ions into the urine.",Aldosterone,HMDB0000037,,,C01780,ALDOSTERONE,FDB021883,aldstrn,[H]OC([H])([H])C(=O)[C@@]1([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])[C@@]2([H])[C@]3([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C4=C([H])C(=O)C([H])([H])C([H])([H])[C@]4(C([H])([H])[H])[C@@]3([H])[C@@]([H])(O[H])C([H])([H])[C@]12C([H])=O,"(+)-Aldosterone***(11b)-11,21-Dihydroxy-3,20-dioxo-pregn-4-en-18-al***(11beta)-11,21-Dihydroxy-3,20-dioxo-pregn-4-en-18-al***11,21-Dihydroxy-3,20-dioxopregn-4-en-18-al***11-Hydroxy-17-(2-hydroxyacetyl)-10-methyl-3-oxo-1,2,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17-tetradecahydrocyclopenta[a]phenanthrene-13-carbaldehyde***11b,21-Dihydroxy-3,20-dioxo-pregn-4-en-18-al***11beta,21-Dihydroxy-3,20-diketo-4-pregnen-18-al***11beta,21-Dihydroxy-3,20-diketopregn-4-ene-18-al***11beta,21-Dihydroxy-3,20-dioxo-pregn-4-en-18-al***11beta,21-Dihydroxypregn-4-ene-3,18,20-trione***18-Formyl-11beta,21-dihydroxy-4-pregnene-3,20-dione***18-Oxocorticosterone***Aldocorten***Aldocortene***Aldocortin***Aldosteronum***D-Aldosterone***delta-Aldosterone***Electrocortin***Elektrocortin***Reichstein X",PQSUYGKTWSAVDQ-ZVIOFETBSA-N,"InChI=1S/C21H28O5/c1-20-7-6-13(24)8-12(20)2-3-14-15-4-5-16(18(26)10-22)21(15,11-23)9-17(25)19(14)20/h8,11,14-17,19,22,25H,2-7,9-10H2,1H3/t14-,15-,16+,17-,19+,20-,21+/m0/s1"

It is a product of purine metabolism in most mammals except higher apes, and it is present in their urine. In humans, uric acid is excreted instead of allantoin. The presence of allantoin in the urine can be an indication of microbial overgrowth or it can be created via non-enzymatic means through high levels of reactive oxygen species. In this regard Allantoin is sometimes used as a marker of oxidative stress. Allantoin can be isolated from cow urine or as a botanical extract of the comfrey plant. It has long been used for its healing, soothing, and anti-irritating properties. Allantoin helps to heal wounds and skin irritations and stimulates the growth of healthy tissue. Allantoin can be found in anti-acne products, sun care products, and clarifying lotions because of its ability to help heal minor wounds and promote healthy skin.

Diadenosine polyphosphates (APnAs, n=3-6) are a family of endogenous vasoactive purine dinucleotides which have been isolated from thrombocytes. APnAs have been demonstrated to be involved in the control of vascular tone as well as the growth of vascular smooth muscle cells and hence, possibly, in atherogenesis. APnAs isolated substances are Ap3A, Ap4A, Ap5A, and Ap6A. APnAs are naturally occurring substances that facilitate tear secretion; they are released from the corneal epithelium, they stimulate tear production and therefore they may be considered as physiological modulators of tear secretion. The APnAs were discovered in the mid-sixties in the course of studies on aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS). APnAs have emerged as intracellular and extracellular signalling molecules implicated in the maintenance and regulation of vital cellular functions and become considered as second messengers. Great variety of physiological and pathological effects in mammalian cells was found to be associated with alterations of APnAs. APnAs are polyphosphated nucleotidic substances which are found in the CNS and are known to be released in a calcium-dependent manner from storage vesicles in brain synaptosomes. AP5A is a specific adenylate kinase inhibitor in the hippocampus, decreasing the rate of decomposition of ADP and the formation of ATP; a pathway that influences the availability of purines in the central nervous system. AP4A is the only APnA that can induce a considerable increase in [Ca2+] in endothelial cells, indicating that its vasoactive effects are comparable to the known effects of arginine vasopressin, Angiotensin II, and ATP.

appnn,7785-70-8,36740,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): &#945;-Pinene is an organic compound of the terpene class, one of two isomers of pinene. It is an alkene and it contains a reactive four-membered ring. It is found in the oils of many species of many coniferous trees, notably the pine. It is also found in the essential oil of rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis). Both enantiomers are known in nature; 1S,5S- or (&#8722;)-&#945;-pinene is more common in European pines, whereas the 1R,5R- or (+)-&#945;-isomer is more common in North America. The racemic mixture is present in some oils such as eucalyptus oil. The four-membered ring in &#945;-pinene 1 makes it a reactive hydrocarbon, prone to skeletal rearrangements such as the Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement. For example, attempts to perform hydration or hydrogen halide addition with the alkene functionality typically lead to rearranged products. of under acidic conditions. With concentrated sulfuric acid and ethanol the major products are terpineol 2 and its ethyl ether 3, while glacial acetic acid gives the corresponding acetate ester 4. With dilute acids, terpin hydrate 5 becomes the major product. With one molar equivalent of anhydrous HCl, the simple addition product 6a can be formed at low temperature in the presence of ether, but it is very unstable. At normal temperatures, or if no ether is present, the major product is bornyl chloride 6b, along with a small amount of fenchyl chloride 6c. For many years 6b (also called ""artificial camphor"") was referred to as ""pinene hydrochloride"", until it was confirmed as identical with bornyl chloride made from camphene. If more HCl is used, achiral 7 (dipentene hydrochloride) is the major product along with some 6b. Nitrosyl chloride followed by base leads to the oxime 8 which can be reduced to ""pinylamine"" 9. Both 8 and 9 are stable compounds containing an intact four-membered ring, and these compounds helped greatly in identifying this important component of the pinene skeleton.

However, NSPs are complicated compounds from the point of view of both physical structure and chemical composition, and they include cellulose, hemi-cellulose, pectin and oligosaccharides. It is well recognized that NSPs are resistant to the digestive enzymes and pass to the hind-gut where microbial degradation takes place.

Although widely present in nature, L-arabinose is rarely used, and its physiological effects in vivo have received little attention. L-arabinose selectively inhibits intestinal sucrase activity in a noncompetitive manner and suppresses the plasma glucose increase due to sucrose ingestion. Because the intestinal absorption of sucrose is inhibited in the presence of L-arabinose, the absorption of sucrose should be reduced by arabinose ingestion. Most of the studies reported so far on the absorption and utilization of L-arabinose relate to omnivore animal species other than humans. In a rare case of two autistic brothers that were not associated with any known metabolic disease, it was found that the median value for their urine samples was 179 umol/mmol creatinine of L-arabinose, nearly six times greater than normal children (PMID: 11238761, 8931641, 1390604, 7628083).

arachcrn,,73100,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Arachidyl carnitine is an acylcarnitine. Numerous disorders have been described that lead to disturbances in energy production and in intermediary metabolism in the organism which are characterized by the production and excretion of unusual acylcarnitines. A mutation in the gene coding for carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase or the OCTN2 transporter aetiologically causes a carnitine deficiency that results in poor intestinal absorption of dietary L-carnitine, its impaired reabsorption by the kidney and, consequently, in increased urinary loss of L-carnitine. Determination of the qualitative pattern of acylcarnitines can be of diagnostic and therapeutic importance. The betaine structure of carnitine requires special analytical procedures for recording. The ionic nature of L-carnitine causes a high water solubility which decreases with increasing chain length of the ester group in the acylcarnitines. Therefore, the distribution of L-carnitine and acylcarnitines in various organs is defined by their function and their physico-chemical properties as well. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) permits screening for free and total carnitine, as well as complete quantitative acylcarnitine determination, including the long-chain acylcarnitine profile.

arachd,506-32-1,15843,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Arachidonic acid is a polyunsaturated, essential fatty acid. It is found in animal and human fat as well as in the liver, brain, and glandular organs, and is a constituent of animal phosphatides. It is formed by the synthesis from dietary linoleic acid. Arachidonic acid mediates inflammation and the functioning of several organs and systems either directly or upon its conversion into eicosanoids. Arachidonic acid in cell membrane phospholipids is the substrate for the synthesis of a range of biologically active compounds (eicosanoids) including prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes. These compounds can act as mediators in their own right and can also act as regulators of other processes, such as platelet aggregation, blood clotting, smooth muscle contraction, leukocyte chemotaxis, inflammatory cytokine production, and immune function. Arachidonic acid can be metabolized by cytochrome p450 (CYP450) enzymes to 5,6-, 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), their corresponding dihydroxyeicosa-trienoic acids (DHETs), and 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE). The production of kidney CYP450 arachidonic acid metabolites is altered in diabetes, pregnancy, hepatorenal syndrome, and in various models of hypertension, and it is likely that changes in this system contribute to the abnormalities in renal function that are associated with many of these conditions. Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) catalyzes the hydrolysis of the sn-2 position of membrane glycerophospholipids to liberate arachidonic acid (PMID: 12736897, 12736897, 12700820, 12570747, 12432908).",Arachidonic acid,HMDB0001043,,,C00219,ARACHIDONIC_ACID,FDB011872,arachd,[H]\C(=C(/[H])C([H])([H])C(\[H])=C(\[H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([O-])=O)C([H])([H])C(\[H])=C(\[H])C([H])([H])C(\[H])=C(\[H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])[H],"(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)-5,8,11,14-Icosatetraenoic acid***(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)-Icosatetraenoic acid***AA***all-cis-5,8,11,14-Eicosatetraenoic acid***ARA***Arachidonate***Arachidonsaeure***cis-5,8,11,14-Eicosatetraenoic acid***cis-Delta(5,8,11,14)-Eicosatetraenoic acid***(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)-5,8,11,14-Icosatetraenoate***(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)-Icosatetraenoate***all-cis-5,8,11,14-Eicosatetraenoate***cis-5,8,11,14-Eicosatetraenoate***cis-delta(5,8,11,14)-Eicosatetraenoate***cis-δ(5,8,11,14)-eicosatetraenoate***cis-δ(5,8,11,14)-eicosatetraenoic acid***(all-Z)-5,8,11,14-Eicosatetraenoate***(all-Z)-5,8,11,14-Eicosatetraenoic acid***5,8,11,14-all-cis-Eicosatetraenoate***5,8,11,14-all-cis-Eicosatetraenoic acid***5,8,11,14-Eicosatetraenoate***5,8,11,14-Eicosatetraenoic acid***5-cis,8-cis,11-cis,14-cis-Eicosatetraenoate***5-cis,8-cis,11-cis,14-cis-Eicosatetraenoic acid***5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z-Eicosatetraenoate***5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z-Eicosatetraenoic acid***cis-D5,8,11,14-Eicosatetraenoate***cis-D5,8,11,14-Eicosatetraenoic acid***Immunocytophyte***Arachidonate, sodium***Arachidonic acid, (all-Z)-isomer, 3H-labeled***Arachidonic acid, ammonium salt, (all-Z)-isomer***Arachidonic acid, cerium salt, (all-Z)-isomer***Arachidonic acid, sodium salt***Arachidonic acid, sodium salt, (all-Z)-isomer***Vitamin F***Arachidonic acid, cesium salt, (all-Z)-isomer***Arachidonic acid, lithium salt, (all-Z)-isomer***Arachidonic acid, potassium salt, (all-Z)-isomer***Sodium arachidonate***Arachidonic acid, (all-Z)-isomer, 1-(14)C-labeled***Arachidonic acid, zinc salt, (all-Z)-isomer***FA(20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z))",YZXBAPSDXZZRGB-DOFZRALJSA-M,"InChI=1S/C20H32O2/c1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-11-12-13-14-15-16-17-18-19-20(21)22/h6-7,9-10,12-13,15-16H,2-5,8,11,14,17-19H2,1H3,(H,21,22)/p-1/b7-6-,10-9-,13-12-,16-15-"

arg_L,74-79-3,16467,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Arginine is an essential amino acid that is physiologically active in the L-form. In mammals, arginine is formally classified as a semiessential or conditionally essential amino acid, depending on the developmental stage and health status of the individual. Infants are unable to effectively synthesize arginine, making it nutritionally essential for infants. Adults, however, are able to synthesize arginine in the urea cycle. Arginine can be considered to be a basic amino acid as the part of the side chain nearest to the backbone is long, carbon-containing and hydrophobic, whereas the end of the side chain is a complex guanidinium group. With a pKa of 12.48, the guanidinium group is positively charged in neutral, acidic and even most basic environments. Because of the conjugation between the double bond and the nitrogen lone pairs, the positive charge is delocalized. This group is able to form multiple H-bonds. L-arginine is an amino acid that has numerous functions in the body. It helps dispose of ammonia, is used to make compounds such as nitric oxide, creatine, L-glutamate, L-proline, and it can be converted to glucose and glycogen if needed. In large doses, L-arginine also stimulates the release of hormones, growth hormone and prolactin. Arginine is a known inducer of MTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) and is responsible for inducing protein synthesis through the MTOR pathway. MTOR inhibition by rapamycin partially reduces arginine-induced protein synthesis (PMID: 20841502). Catabolic disease states such as sepsis, injury, and cancer cause an increase in arginine utilization, which can exceed normal body production, leading to arginine depletion. Arginine also activates AMP kinase (AMPK) which then stimulates skeletal muscle fatty acid oxidation and muscle glucose uptake, thereby increasing insulin secretion by pancreatic beta-cells (PMID: 21311355). Moreover, L-arginine is found to be associated with argininemia, cystinuria, hyperdibasic aminoaciduria I, maple syrup urine disease, propionic acidemia, and tyrosinemia I, which are inborn errors of metabolism. Arginine is found in plant and animal proteins, such as dairy products, meat, poultry, fish, and nuts. The ratio of L-arginine to lysine is also important - soy and other plant proteins have more L-arginine than animal sources of protein.",L-Arginine,HMDB0000517,,,C00062,ARG,FDB002257,arg_L,[H]N([H])C(N([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])[C@@]([H])(C([O-])=O)[N+]([H])([H])[H])=[N+]([H])[H],"(2S)-2-amino-5-(carbamimidamido)Pentanoic acid***(2S)-2-amino-5-Guanidinopentanoic acid***(S)-2-amino-5-Guanidinopentanoic acid***(S)-2-amino-5-Guanidinovaleric acid***Arg***Arginine***L-(+)-Arginine***L-Arg***L-Arginin***R***(2S)-2-amino-5-(carbamimidamido)Pentanoate***(2S)-2-amino-5-Guanidinopentanoate***(S)-2-amino-5-Guanidinopentanoate***(S)-2-amino-5-Guanidinovalerate***(S)-2-amino-5-[(Aminoiminomethyl)amino]-pentanoate***(S)-2-amino-5-[(Aminoiminomethyl)amino]-pentanoic acid***(S)-2-amino-5-[(Aminoiminomethyl)amino]pentanoate***(S)-2-amino-5-[(Aminoiminomethyl)amino]pentanoic acid***2-amino-5-Guanidinovalerate***2-amino-5-Guanidinovaleric acid***5-[(Aminoiminomethyl)amino]-L-norvaline***L-a-amino-D-Guanidinovalerate***L-a-amino-D-Guanidinovaleric acid***L-alpha-amino-delta-Guanidinovalerate***L-alpha-amino-delta-Guanidinovaleric acid***N5-(Aminoiminomethyl)-L-ornithine***DL-Arginine acetate, monohydrate***L-Isomer arginine***Monohydrate DL-arginine acetate***L Arginine***Arginine, L isomer***Arginine, L-isomer***Hydrochloride, arginine***Arginine hydrochloride***DL Arginine acetate, monohydrate",ODKSFYDXXFIFQN-BYPYZUCNSA-O,"InChI=1S/C6H14N4O2/c7-4(5(11)12)2-1-3-10-6(8)9/h4H,1-3,7H2,(H,11,12)(H4,8,9,10)/p+1/t4-/m0/s1"

argsuc,2387-71-5,15682,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Arginosuccinic acid is a basic amino acid. Some cells synthesize it from citrulline, aspartic acid and use it as a precursor for arginine in the urea cycle or Citrulline-NO cycle. The enzyme that catalyzes the reaction is argininosuccinate synthetase. Argininosuccinic acid is a precursor to fumarate in the citric acid cycle via argininosuccinate lyase. Defects in the argininosuccinate lyase enzyme can lead to argininosuccinate lyase deficiency, which is an inborn error of metabolism. Argininosuccinate (ASA) lyase deficiency results in defective cleavage of ASA. This leads to an accumulation of ASA in cells and an excessive excretion of ASA in urine (argininosuccinic aciduria). In virtually all respects, this disorder shares the characteristics of other urea cycle defects. The most important characteristic of ASA lyase deficiency is its propensity to cause hyperammonemia in affected individuals. ASA in affected individuals is excreted by the kidney at a rate practically equivalent to the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Whether ASA itself causes a degree of toxicity due to hepatocellular accumulation is unknown; such an effect could help explain hyperammonemia development in affected individuals. Regardless, the name of the disease is derived from the rapid clearance of ASA in urine, although elevated levels of ASA can be found in plasma. ASA lyase deficiency is associated with high mortality and morbidity rates. Symptoms of ASA lyase deficiency include anorexia, irritability rapid breathing, lethargy and vomiting. Extreme symptoms include coma and cerebral edema.",Argininosuccinic acid,HMDB0000052,,,C03406,,FDB021885,argsuc,[H]N(C(N([H])C([H])(C([O-])=O)C([H])([H])C([O-])=O)=[N+]([H])[H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])[C@@]([H])(C([O-])=O)[N+]([H])([H])[H],"2-(Nomega-L-arginino)succinate***L-Argininosuccinate***L-Argininosuccinic acid***L-Arginosuccinic acid***2-(Nomega-L-arginino)succinic acid***Argininosuccinate***L-Arginosuccinate***2-(N(Omega)-L-arginine)succinate***2-(N(Omega)-L-arginine)succinic acid***2-(N(Omega)-L-arginino)succinate***2-(N(Omega)-L-arginino)succinic acid***2-(Nw-l-arginino)butanedioate***2-(Nw-l-arginino)butanedioic acid***Arginosuccinate***Arginosuccinic acid***ASA***N(Omega)-(L-arginino)succinate***N(Omega)-(L-arginino)succinic acid***N-(((4-amino-4-Carboxybutyl)amino)iminomethyl)-L-aspartate***N-(((4-amino-4-Carboxybutyl)amino)iminomethyl)-L-aspartic acid***N-(L-arginino) Succinate***N-(L-arginino) Succinic acid***N-(L-arginino)Succinate***N-(L-arginino)Succinic acid***N-[(4-amino-4-Carboxybutyl)amidino]-L-aspartate***N-[(4-amino-4-Carboxybutyl)amidino]-L-aspartic acid***N-[[(4-amino-4-Carboxybutyl)amino]iminomethyl]-L-aspartate***N-[[(4-amino-4-Carboxybutyl)amino]iminomethyl]-L-aspartic acid***Acid, argininosuccinic***N-(4-amino-4-Carboxybutyl)amidino-L-aspartic acid",KDZOASGQNOPSCU-ZBHICJROSA-M,"InChI=1S/C10H18N4O6/c11-5(8(17)18)2-1-3-13-10(12)14-6(9(19)20)4-7(15)16/h5-6H,1-4,11H2,(H,15,16)(H,17,18)(H,19,20)(H3,12,13,14)/p-1/t5-,6?/m0/s1"

ascb_L,50-81-7,17208,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Ascorbic acid is found naturally in citrus fruits and many vegetables and is an essential nutrient in human diets. It is necessary to maintain connective tissue and bone. The biologically active form of ascorbic acid is vitamin C. Vitamin C is a water soluble vitamin. Primates (including humans) and a few other species in all divisions of the animal kingdom, notably the guinea pig, have lost the ability to synthesize ascorbic acid and must obtain it in their food. Vitamin C functions as a reducing agent and coenzyme in several metabolic pathways. Vitamin C is considered an antioxidant (PubChem). Ascorbic acid is an electron donor for enzymes involved in collagen hydroxylation, biosynthesis of carnitine and norepinephrine, tyrosine metabolism, and amidation of peptide hormones. Ascrobic acid (vitamin C) deficiency causes scurvy. The amount of vitamin C necessary to prevent scurvy may not be adequate to maintain optimal health. The ability of vitamin C to donate electrons also makes it a potent water-soluble antioxidant that readily scavenges free radicals such as molecular oxygen, superoxide, hydroxyl radical, and hypochlorous acid. In this setting, several mechanisms could account for a link between vitamin C and heart disease. One is the relation between LDL oxidation and vitamins C and E. Vitamin C in vitro can recycle vitamin E, which can donate electrons to prevent LDL oxidation in vitro. As the lipid-phase vitamin E is oxidized, it can be regenerated by aqueous vitamin C. Other possibilities are that vitamin C could decrease cholesterol by mechanisms not well characterized, or could improve vasodilatation and vascular reactivity, perhaps by decreasing the interactions of nitric oxide with oxidants (PMID: 10799361).

asn_L,70-47-3,17196,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Asparagine (Asn) is one of the 20 most common natural amino acids on Earth. It has carboxamide as the side chain's functional group. It is considered a non-essential amino acid. Asparagine is not an essential amino acid, which means that it can be synthesized from central metabolic pathway intermediates in humans and is not required in the diet. The precursor to asparagine is oxaloacetate. Oxaloacetate is converted to aspartate using a transaminase enzyme. The enzyme transfers the amino group from glutamate to oxaloacetate producing alpha-ketoglutarate and aspartate. The enzyme asparagine synthetase produces asparagine, AMP, glutamate, and pyrophosphate from aspartate, glutamine, and ATP. In the asparagine synthetase reaction, ATP is used to activate aspartate, forming beta-aspartyl-AMP. glutamine donates an ammonium group which reacts with beta-aspartyl-AMP to form asparagine and free AMP. Since the asparagine side chain can make efficient hydrogen bond interactions with the peptide backbone, asparagines are often found near the beginning and end of alpha-helices, and in turn motifs in beta sheets. Its role can be thought as ""capping"" the hydrogen bond interactions which would otherwise need to be satisfied by the polypeptide backbone. glutamines have an extra methylene group, have more conformational entropy and thus are less useful in this regard. Asparagine also provides key sites for N-linked glycosylation, modification of the protein chain with the addition of carbohydrate chains. A reaction between asparagine and reducing sugars or reactive carbonyls produces acrylamide (acrylic amide) in food when heated to sufficient temperature, i.e. baking. These occur primarily in baked goods such as french fries, potato chips, and roasted coffee. Asparagine was first isolated in 1806 from asparagus juice, in which it is abundant--hence its name--becoming the first amino acid to be isolated. The smell observed in the urine of some individuals after their consumption of asparagus is attributed to a byproduct of the metabolic breakdown of asparagine, asparagine-amino-succinic-acid monoamide. (However, some scientists disagree and implicate other substances in the smell, especially methanethiol).

aso4,15584-04-0,18231,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): The arsenate ion is AsO43&#8722. An arsenate (compound) is any compound that contains this ion.The arsenic atom in arsenate has a valency of 5 and is also known as pentavalent arsenic or As[V].Arsenate resembles phosphate in many respects, since arsenic and phosphorus occur in the same group (column) of the periodic table. In acidic conditions arsenate exists as arsenic acid, H3AsO4;in weakly acid conditions it exists as dihydrogen arsenate ion, H2AsO4&#8722;; in weakly basic conditions it exists as hydrogen arsenate ion HAsO42&#8722;; and finally, in basic conditions, it exists as the arsenate ion AsO43&#8722. Arsenate can replace inorganic phosphate in the step of glycolysis that produces 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate, yielding 1-arseno-3-phosphoglycerate instead. This molecule is unstable and quickly hydrolyzes, forming the next intermediate in the pathway, 3-phosphoglycerate. Therefore glycolysis proceeds, but the ATP molecule that would be generated from 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate is lost - arsenate is an uncoupler of glycolysis, explaining its toxicity.[1]. Some species of bacteria obtain their energy by oxidizing various fuels while reducing arsenates to form arsenites. The enzymes involved are known as arsenate reductases. In 2008, bacteria were discovered that employ a version of photosynthesis with arsenites as electron donors, producing arsenates (just like ordinary photosynthesis uses water as electron donor, producing molecular oxygen). The researchers conjectured that historically these photosynthesizing organisms produced the arsenates that allowed the arsenate-reducing bacteria to thrive.

asp_L,56-84-8,17053,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Aspartic acid (Asp, D), also known as aspartate, the name of its anion, is one of the 20 natural proteinogenic amino acids which are the building blocks of proteins. As its name indicates, aspartic acid is the carboxylic acid analog of asparagine. As a neurotransmitter, aspartic acid may provide resistance to fatigue and thus lead to endurance, although the evidence to support this idea is not strong. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartic_acid) Aspartic acid is a nonessential amino acid which is made from glutamic acid by enzymes using vitamin B6. The amino acid has important roles in the urea cycle and DNA metabolism. Aspartic acid is a major excitatory neurotransmitter, which is sometimes found to be increased in epileptic and stroke patients. It is decreased in depressed patients and in patients with brain atrophy. Aspartic acid supplements are being evaluated. Five grams can raise blood levels. Magnesium and zinc may be natural inhibitors of some of the actions of aspartic acid. Aspartic acid, with the amino acid phenylalanine, is a part of a new natural sweetener, aspartame. This sweetener is an advance in artificial sweeteners, and is probably safe in normal doses to all except phenylketonurics. The jury is still out on the long term effects it has on many brain neurohormones. Aspartic acid may be a significant immunostimulant of the thymus and can protect against some of the damaging effects of radiation. Many claims have been made for the special value of administering aspartic acid in the form of potassium and magnesium salts. Since aspartic acid is relatively nontoxic, studies are now in progress to elucidate its pharmacological and therapeutic roles.

atp,56-65-5,15422,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a nucleotide consisting of a purine base (adenine) attached to the first carbon atom of ribose (a pentose sugar). Three phosphate groups are esterified at the fifth carbon atom of the ribose. ATP is incorporated into nucleic acids by polymerases in the processes of DNA replication and transcription. ATP contributes to cellular energy charge and participates in overall energy balance, maintaining cellular homeostasis. ATP can act as an extracellular signaling molecule via interactions with specific purinergic receptors to mediate a wide variety of processes as diverse as neurotransmission, inflammation, apoptosis, and bone remodelling. Extracellular ATP and its metabolite adenosine have also been shown to exert a variety of effects on nearly every cell type in human skin, and ATP seems to play a direct role in triggering skin inflammatory, regenerative, and fibrotic responses to mechanical injury, an indirect role in melanocyte proliferation and apoptosis, and a complex role in Langerhans cell-directed adaptive immunity. During exercise, intracellular homeostasis depends on the matching of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) supply and ATP demand. Metabolites play a useful role in communicating the extent of ATP demand to the metabolic supply pathways. Effects as different as proliferation or differentiation, chemotaxis, release of cytokines or lysosomal constituents, and generation of reactive oxygen or nitrogen species are elicited upon stimulation of blood cells with extracellular ATP. The increased concentration of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in erythrocytes from patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) has been observed in many studies but the mechanism leading to these abnormalities still is controversial.

b2coa,102680-35-3,15473,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Crotonoyl-CoA is an important component in several metabolic pathways, notably fatty acid and amino acid metabolism. It is the substrate of a group of enzymes acyl-Coenzyme A oxidases 1, 2, 3 (E.C.: 1.3.3.6) corresponding to palmitoyl, branched chain, and pristanoyl, respectively, in the peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation, producing hydrogen peroxide. Abnormality of this group of enzymes is linked to coma, dehydration, diabetes, fatty liver, hyperinsulinemia, hyperlipidemia, and leukodystrophy. It is also a substrate of a group of enzymes called acyl-Coenzyme A dehydrogenase (E.C.:1.3.99-, including 1.3.99.2, 1.3.99.3) in the metabolism of fatty acids or branched chain amino acids in the mitochondria (Rozen et al., 1994). Acyl-Coenzyme A dehydrogenase (1.3.99.3) has shown to contribute to kidney-associated diseases, such as adrenogential syndrome, kidney failure, kidney tubular necrosis, homocystinuria, as well as other diseases including cretinism, encephalopathy, hypoglycemia, medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. The gene (ACADS) also plays a role in theta oscillation during sleep. In addition, crotonoyl-CoA is the substrate of enoyl coenzyme A hydratase (E.C.4.2.1.17) in the mitochondria during lysine degradation and tryptophan metabolism, benzoate degradation via CoA ligation; in contrast it is the product of this enzyme in the butanoate metabolism. Moreover, it is produced from multiple enzymes in the butanoate metabolism pathway, including 3-Hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydratase (E.C.:4.2.1.55), glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylase (E.C.: 4.1.1.70), vinylacetyl-CoA &#916;-isomerase (E.C.: 5.3.3.3), and trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase (NAD+) (E.C.: 1.3.1.44). In lysine degradation and tryptophan metabolism, crotonoyl CoA is produced by glutaryl-Coenzyme A dehydrogenase (E.C.:1.3.99.7) lysine and tryptophan metabolic pathway.

bgly,495-69-2,18089,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Hippuric acid is an acyl glycine formed by the conjugation of benzoic aicd with glycine. Acyl glycines are produced through the action of glycine N-acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.13) which is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction: acyl-CoA + glycine < -- > CoA + N-acylglycine. Hippuric acid is a normal component of urine and is typically increased with increased consumption of phenolic compounds (tea, wine, fruit juices). These phenols are converted to benzoic acid which is then converted to hippuric acid and excreted in the urine. Hippuric acid is the most frequently used biomarker in the biological monitoring of occupational exposure to toluene. This product of solvent biotransformation may be also found in the urine of individuals who have not been exposed to the solvent. A smaller fraction of the absorbed toluene is oxidized to aromatic compounds including ortho-cresol, which is not found significantly in the urine of nonexposed individuals. The concentration of hippuric acid in the urine of individuals exposed to a low toluene concentration does not differ from that of individuals not exposed to the solvent. This has led to the conclusion that hippuric acid should not be utilized in the biological monitoring of occupational exposure to low levels of toluene in the air. Protein-bound organic acids such as hippuric acid are markedly accumulated in uremic plasma and produce defective protein binding of drugs (PMID: 9120876, 8734460).

Like the other ketone bodies (acetoacetate and acetone), levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate are raised in the blood and urine in ketosis. Beta-hydroxybutyrate is a typical partial-degradation product of branched-chain amino acids (primarily valine) released from muscle for hepatic and renal gluconeogenesis This acid is metabolized by 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (catalyzes the oxidation of D-3-hydroxybutyrate to form acetoacetate, using NAD+ as an electron acceptor). The enzyme functions in nervous tissues and muscles, enabling the use of circulating hydroxybutyrate as a fuel. In the liver mitochondrial matrix, the enzyme can also catalyze the reverse reaction, a step in ketogenesis. 3-Hydroxybutyric acid is a chiral compound having two enantiomers, D-3-hydroxybutyric acid and L-3-hydroxybutyric acid. In humans, beta-hydroxybutyrate is synthesized in the liver from acetyl-CoA, and can be used as an energy source by the brain when blood glucose is low.

In human cells, biotin is essential to maintain metabolic homeostasis and as regulator of gene expression. The vitamin biotin plays an essential role in gluconeogenesis, fatty acid synthesis, and carbohydrate metabolism because of its role as cofactor of five carboxylases; pyruvate carboxylase (PC), propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC), methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase, and two forms of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC-1 and ACC-2). Carboxylase biotinylation is catalyzed by the enzyme holocarboxylase synthetase (HCS) through a reaction that involves the transformation of biotin into B-AMP and its subsequent attachment to a specific lysine residue in the carboxylases. B-AMP is also required to activate a signal transduction cascade that includes a soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) and cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG). The regulatory role of biotin in the biotin cycle seems to be limited to the expression of proteins involved in the transport and utilization of exogenous vitamin while having no effect on biotinidase mRNA levels, enzyme responsible for biotin recycling during carboxylase turnover.

btn,58-85-5,15956,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Biotin is an enzyme co-factor present in minute amounts in every living cell. Biotin is also known as vitamin H or B7 or coenzyme R. It occurs mainly bound to proteins or polypeptides and is abundant in liver, kidney, pancreas, yeast, and milk. Biotin has been recognized as an essential nutrient. Our biotin requirement is fulfilled in part through diet, through endogenous reutilization of biotin and perhaps through capture of biotin generated in the intestinal flora. The utilization of biotin for covalent attachment to carboxylases and its reutilization through the release of carboxylase biotin after proteolytic degradation constitutes the 'biotin cycle'. Biotin deficiency is associated with neurological manifestations, skin rash, hair loss and metabolic disturbances that are thought to relate to the various carboxylase deficiencies (metabolic ketoacidosis with lactic acidosis). It has also been suggested that biotin deficiency is associated with protein malnutrition, and that marginal biotin deficiency in pregnant women may be teratogenic. Biotin acts as a carboxyl carrier in carboxylation reactions. There are four biotin-dependent carboxylases in mammals: those of propionyl-CoA (PCC), 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA (MCC), pyruvate (PC) and acetyl-CoA carboxylases (isoforms ACC-1 and ACC-2). All but ACC-2 are mitochondrial enzymes. The biotin moiety is covalently bound to the epsilon amino group of a Lysine residue in each of these carboxylases in a domain 60-80 amino acids long. The domain is structurally similar among carboxylases from bacteria to mammals. There are four biotin-dependent carboxylases in mammals: those of propionyl-CoA (PCC), 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA (MCC), pyruvate (PC) and acetyl-CoA carboxylases (isoforms ACC-1 and ACC-2). All but ACC-2 are mitochondrial enzymes. The biotin moiety is covalently bound to the epsilon amino group of a Lys residue in each of these carboxylases in a domain 60-80 amino acids long. The domain is structurally similar among carboxylases from bacteria to mammals. Evidence is emerging that biotin participates in processes other than classical carboxylation reactions. Specifically, novel roles for biotin in cell signaling, gene expression, and chromatin structure have been identified in recent years. Human cells accumulate biotin by using both the sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter and monocarboxylate transporter 1. These transporters and other biotin-binding proteins partition biotin to compartments involved in biotin signaling: cytoplasm, mitochondria, and nuclei. The activity of cell signals such as biotinyl-AMP, Sp1 and Sp3, nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, and receptor tyrosine kinases depends on biotin supply. Consistent with a role for biotin and its catabolites in modulating these cell signals, greater than 2000 biotin-dependent genes have been identified in various human tissues. Many biotin-dependent gene products play roles in signal transduction and localize to the cell nucleus, consistent with a role for biotin in cell signaling. Posttranscriptional events related to ribosomal activity and protein folding may further contribute to effects of biotin on gene expression. Finally, research has shown that biotinidase and holocarboxylase synthetase mediate covalent binding of biotin to histones (DNA-binding proteins), affecting chromatin structure; at least seven biotinylation sites have been identified in human histones. Biotinylation of histones appears to play a role in cell proliferation, gene silencing, and the cellular response to DNA repair. Roles for biotin in cell signaling and chromatin structure are consistent with the notion that biotin has a unique significance in cell biology.

Butyrate has diverse and apparently paradoxical effects on cellular proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation that may be either pro-neoplastic or anti-neoplastic, depending upon factors such as the level of exposure, availability of other metabolic substrate and the intracellular milieu. In humans, the relationship between luminal butyrate exposure and CRC has been examined only indirectly in case-control studies, by measuring fecal butyrate concentrations, although this may not accurately reflect effective butyrate exposure during carcinogenesis. Perhaps not surprisingly, results of these investigations have been mutually contradictory. The direct effect of butyrate on tumorigenesis has been assessed in a no. of in vivo animal models, which have also yielded conflicting results. In part, this may be explained by methodology: differences in the amount and route of butyrate administration, which are likely to significantly influence delivery of butyrate to the distal colon.

C01290,4682-48-8,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Lactosylceramide (d18:1/12:0) is a lactosylceramide or LacCer. Lactosylceramides are the most important and abundant of the diosylceramides. Lactosylceramides (LacCer) were originally called 'cytolipin H'. It is found in small amounts only in most animal tissues, but it has a number of significant biological functions and it is of great importance as the biosynthetic precursor of most of the neutral oligoglycosylceramides, sulfatides and gangliosides. In animal tissues, biosynthesis of lactosylceramide involves addition of the second monosaccharides unit (galactose) as its nucleotide derivative to monoglucosylceramide, catalysed by a specific beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase on the lumenal side of the Golgi apparatus. The glucosylceramide precursor must first cross from the cytosolic side of the membrane, possibly via the action of a flippase. The lactosylceramide produced can be further glycosylated or transferred to the plasma membrane. Lactosylceramide may assist in stabilizing the plasma membrane and activating receptor molecules in the special micro-domains or rafts, as with the cerebrosides. It may also have its own specialized function in the immunological system in that it is known to bind to specific bacteria. In addition, it is believed that a number of pro-inflammatory factors activate lactosylceramide synthase to generate lactosylceramide, which in turn activates ""oxygen-sensitive"" signalling pathways that affect such cellular processes as proliferation, adhesion, migration and angiogenesis. Dysfunctions in these pathways can affect several diseases of the cardiovascular system, cancer and inflammatory states, so lactosylceramide metabolism is a potential target for new therapeutic treatments. beta-D-galactosyl-1,4-beta-D-glucosylceramide is the second to last step in the synthesis of N-Acylsphingosine and is converted. from Glucosylceramide via the enzyme beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase 6 (EC:2.4.1.-).

C01507,69-65-8,16899,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Mannitol is a diuretic and renal diagnostic aid related to sorbitol. It has little significant energy value as it is largely eliminated from the body before any metabolism can take place. It can be used to treat oliguria associated with kidney failure or other manifestations of inadequate renal function and has been used for determination of glomerular filtration rate. Mannitol is also commonly used as a research tool in cell biological studies, usually to control osmolarity. Chemically, mannitol is an alcohol and a sugar, or a polyol; it is similar to xylitol or sorbitol. However, mannitol has a tendency to lose a hydrogen ion in aqueous solutions, which causes the solution to become acidic. For this, it is not uncommon to add a substance to adjust its pH, such as sodium bicarbonate. Mannitol is a non-permeating molecule i.e. it cannot cross biological membranes. Mannitol or hexan-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexol (C6H8(OH)6) is an osmotic diuretic agent and a weak renal vasodilator. It is a sorbitol isomer.

C01747,2238-90-6,16874,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Galactosylsphingosine (also known as psychosine), is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of cerebrosides. It is formed from the reaction of sphingosine with UDP-galactose and then reacts with fatty acid-coenzyme A to form the cerebroside. It is a galactoside metabolite of sphingosine and can function as a neurotoxin and a metabotoxin. A neurotoxin is a compound that disrupts or attacks neural cells and neural tissue. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of galactosylsphingosine are associated with globoid cell leukodystrophy (Krabbe disease), which is characterized by the dysfunction of galactosylceramidase. Galactosylsphingosine is a highly cytotoxic lipid capable of inducing cell death in a wide variety of cell types including oligodendrocytes. It is known to accumulate in the nervous system in the absence of galactosylceramidase. Galactosylsphingosine localizes to lipid rafts and perturbs membrane integrity. It also inhibits protein kinase C translocation to the plasma membrane (PMID: 24006512). Symptoms of Krabbe disease begin between the ages of 3 and 6 months with irritability, fevers, limb stiffness, seizures, feeding difficulties, vomiting, and slowing of mental and motor development.

L-alpha-amino acids are alpha amino acids which have the L-configuration of the alpha-carbon atom. L-alpha-aminobutyric acid is soluble (in water) and a moderately acidic compound (based on its pKa). L-alpha-aminobutyric acid is a non-proteogenic amino acid that can be found in human kidney and liver tissues, and in most biofluids or excreta, some of which include feces, breast milk, urine, and blood. Within the cell, L-alpha-aminobutyric acid is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Alpha-aminobutyric acid is biosynthesized by transaminating oxobutyrate, a metabolite in isoleucine biosynthesis. As a non-proteogenic amino acid alpha-aminobutyric acid can be used by nonribosomal peptide synthases. One example of a nonribosomal peptide containing alpha-aminobutyric acid is ophthalmic acid, which was first isolated from calf lens. Alpha-aminobutyric acid is a non-essential amino acid that is primarily derived from the catabolism of methionine, threonine and serine. High protein diets can result in significantly higher alpha-aminobutyrate levels in plasma (PMID: 26227325).

C02469,,15436,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Uroporphyrin is the porphyrin produced by oxidation of the methylene bridges in uroporphyrinogen. Uroporphyrins have four acetic acid and four propionic acid side chains attached to their pyrrole rings. The enzyme uroporphyrinogen I synthase catalyzes the formation of hydroxymethylbilane from four molecules of porphobilinogen. Uroporphyrinogen III cosynthase then catalyzes the conversion of hydroxymethylbilane into uroporphyrinogen III. Otherwise, hydroxymethylbilane cyclizes nonenzymatically to form uroporphyrinogen I. Uroporphyrinogen I and III yield their respective uroporphyrins via autooxidation or their respective coproporphyrinogens via decarboxylation. Excessive amounts of uroporphyrin I are excreted in congenital erythropoietic porphyria, and both uroporphyrin I and uroporphyrin III are excreted in porphyria cutanea tarda. Uroporphyrin I and III are the most common isomers. Under certain conditions, uroporphyrin III can act as a phototoxin, a neurotoxin, and a metabotoxin. A phototoxin leads to cell damage upon exposure to light. A neurotoxin causes damage to nerve cells and nerve tissues. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of porphyrins are associated with porphyrias such as porphyria variegate, acute intermittent porphyria, porphyria cutanea tarda, and hereditary coproporphyria (HCP). There are several types of porphyrias (most are inherited). Hepatic porphyrias are characterized by acute neurological attacks (seizures, psychosis, extreme back and abdominal pain, and an acute polyneuropathy), while the erythropoietic forms present with skin problems (usually a light-sensitive blistering rash and increased hair growth). The neurotoxicity of porphyrins may be due to their selective interactions with tubulin, which disrupt microtubule formation and cause neural malformations (PMID: 3441503).",Uroporphyrin III,HMDB0000916,,,C02469,UROPORPHYRIN_III,FDB005664,,[H]OC(=O)C([H])([H])C1=C(\C2=C([H])\C3=C(C(=C(N3[H])\C([H])=C3/N=C(/C(/[H])=C4\N([H])\C(=C([H])/C1=N2)C(=C4C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C(=O)O[H])C([H])([H])C(=O)O[H])C(=C3C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C(=O)O[H])C([H])([H])C(=O)O[H])C([H])([H])C(=O)O[H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C(=O)O[H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C(=O)O[H],"3,8,13,17-Tetrakis(carboxymethyl)porphyrin-2,7,12,18-tetrapropionic acid***3,8,13,17-Tetrakis(carboxymethyl)porphyrin-2,7,12,18-tetrapropionate***3,8,13,17-Tetrakis(carboxymethyl)porphyrin-2,7,12,18-tetrapropanoate***3,8,13,17-Tetrakis(carboxymethyl)porphyrin-2,7,12,18-tetrapropanoic acid***3,8,13,17-Tetramethyl-2,7,12,18-porphinetetrapropionate***3,8,13,17-Tetramethyl-2,7,12,18-porphinetetrapropionic acid***Coproporphyrin III",VZVFNUAIRVUCEW-UJJXFSCMSA-N,"InChI=1S/C40H38N4O16/c45-33(46)5-1-17-21(9-37(53)54)29-14-27-19(3-7-35(49)50)22(10-38(55)56)30(43-27)15-28-20(4-8-36(51)52)24(12-40(59)60)32(44-28)16-31-23(11-39(57)58)18(2-6-34(47)48)26(42-31)13-25(17)41-29/h13-16,41,44H,1-12H2,(H,45,46)(H,47,48)(H,49,50)(H,51,52)(H,53,54)(H,55,56)(H,57,58)(H,59,60)/b25-13-,26-13-,27-14-,28-15-,29-14-,30-15-,31-16-,32-16-"

Xanthurenic acid is slightly soluble (in water) and a moderately acidic compound (based on its pKa). Xanthurenic acid can be found primarily in blood, feces, and urine, as well as in human epidermis tissue. Within the cell, xanthurenic acid is primarily located in the membrane. Xanthurenic acid exists in all eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans. In humans, xanthurenic acid is involved in the tryptophan metabolism. Moreover, xanthurenic acid is found to be associated with citrullinemia type I, which is an inborn error of metabolism. Xanthurenic acid is a metabolite from tryptophan catabolism.

The distinction between different bile acids is minute, depends only on presence or absence of hydroxyl groups on positions 3, 7, and 12. Bile acids are physiological detergents that facilitate excretion, absorption, and transport of fats and sterols in the intestine and liver. Bile acids are also steroidal amphipathic molecules derived from the catabolism of cholesterol. They modulate bile flow and lipid secretion, are essential for the absorption of dietary fats and vitamins, and have been implicated in the regulation of all the key enzymes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Bile acids recirculate through the liver, bile ducts, small intestine and portal vein to form an enterohepatic circuit. They exist as anions at physiological pH and, consequently, require a carrier for transport across the membranes of the enterohepatic tissues. The unique detergent properties of bile acids are essential for the digestion and intestinal absorption of hydrophobic nutrients. Bile acids have potent toxic properties (e.g., membrane disruption) and there are a plethora of mechanisms to limit their accumulation in blood and tissues.

C02712,65-82-7,165927,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): N-acetyl-L-methionine is nutritionally and metabolically equivalent to L-methionine. Methionine is a dietary indispensable amino acid required for normal growth and development of humans, other mammals, and avian species. In addition to being a substrate for protein synthesis, it is an intermediate in transmethylation reactions, serving as the major methyl group donor in vivo, including the methyl groups for DNA and RNA intermediates. Methionine is a methyl acceptor for 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyl transferase (methionine synthase), the only reaction that allows for the recycling of this form of folate, and is also a methyl acceptor for the catabolism of betaine. Methionine is also required for synthesis of cysteine. Methionine is accepted as the metabolic precursor for cysteine. Only the sulfur atom from methionine is transferred to cysteine; the carbon skeleton of cysteine is donated by serine. (PMID 16702340). The adequacy range of dietary requirements of specific amino acids in disease states is difficult to determine. Requirements may not be similar in disease with regard to protein synthesis. Requirements for this purpose can be assessed only when such a function can be measured and related to clinical outcome. There is apparent consensus concerning normal sulfur amino acid (SAA) requirements. WHO recommendations amount to 13 mg/kg per 24 h in healthy adults. This amount is roughly doubled in artificial nutrition regimens. In disease or after trauma, requirements may be altered for methionine, cysteine, and taurine. Although in specific cases of congenital enzyme deficiency, prematurity, or diminished liver function, hypermethionemia or hyperhomocysteinemia may occur, SAA supplementation can be considered safe in amounts exceeding 2-3 times the minimal recommended daily intake. Apart from some very specific indications (e.g., acetaminophen poisoning) the usefulness of SAA supplementation is not yet established.(PMID 16702341). Methionine is known to exacerbate psychopathological symptoms in schizophrenic patients, there is no evidence of similar effects in healthy subjects. The role of methionine as a precursor of homocysteine is the most notable cause for concern. A ""loading dose"" of methionine (0.1 g/kg) has been given, and the resultant acute increase in plasma homocysteine has been used as an index of the susceptibility to cardiovascular disease. Although this procedure results in vascular dysfunction, this is acute and unlikely to result in permanent damage. However, a 10-fold larger dose, given mistakenly, resulted in death. Longer-term studies in adults have indicated no adverse consequences of moderate fluctuations in dietary methionine intake, but intakes higher than 5 times normal resulted in elevated homocysteine levels. These effects of methionine on homocysteine and vascular function are moderated by supplements of vitamins B-6, B-12, C, and folic acid. In infants, methionine intakes of 2 to 5 times normal resulted in impaired growth and extremely high plasma methionine levels, but no adverse long-term consequences were observed.

LTE4 is a cysteinyl leukotriene. Cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs) are a family of potent inflammatory mediators that appear to contribute to the pathophysiologic features of allergic rhinitis. Nasal blockage induced by CysLTs is mainly due to dilatation of nasal blood vessels which can be induced by the nitric oxide produced through CysLT1 receptor activation. LTE4 activates contractile and inflammatory processes via specific interactions with putative seven transmembrane-spanning receptors that couple to G proteins and subsequent intracellular signaling pathways. LTE4 is metabolized from leukotriene C4 in a reaction catalyzed by gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and a particulate dipeptidase from kidney (PMID: 12607939, 12432945, 6311078). Leukotrienes are eicosanoids. The eicosanoids consist of the prostaglandins (PGs), thromboxanes (TXs), leukotrienes (LTs), and lipoxins (LXs). The PGs and TXs are collectively identified as prostanoids. Prostaglandins were originally shown to be synthesized in the prostate gland, thromboxanes from platelets (thrombocytes), and leukotrienes from leukocytes, hence the derivation of their names.

Fatty acid degradation is the process in which fatty acids are broken down, resulting in release of energy. It includes three major steps:Activation and transport into mitochondria, &#946;-oxidation and Electron transport chain. Fatty acids are transported across the outer mitochondrial membrane by carnitine-palmitoyl transferase I (CPT-I), and then couriered across the inner mitochondrial membrane by carnitine[1]. Once inside the mitochondrial matrix, fatty acyl-carnitine reacts with coenzyme A to release the fatty acid and produce acetyl-CoA. CPT-I is believed to be the rate limiting step in fatty acid oxidation. Once inside the mitochondrial matrix, fatty acids undergo &#946;-oxidation. During this process, two-carbon molecules acetyl-CoA are repeatedly cleaved from the fatty acid. Acetyl-CoA can then enter the TCA cycle, which produces NADH and FADH.

C05767,,27484,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Uroporphyrin is the porphyrin produced by oxidation of the methylene bridges in uroporphyrinogen. Uroporphyrins have four acetic acid and four propionic acid side chains attached to their pyrrole rings. The enzyme uroporphyrinogen I synthase catalyzes the formation of hydroxymethylbilane from four molecules of porphobilinogen. Uroporphyrinogen III cosynthase then catalyzes the conversion of hydroxymethylbilane into uroporphyrinogen III. Otherwise, hydroxymethylbilane cyclizes nonenzymatically to form uroporphyrinogen I. Uroporphyrinogen I and III yield their respective uroporphyrins via autooxidation or their respective coproporphyrinogens via decarboxylation. Excessive amounts of uroporphyrin I are excreted in congenital erythropoietic porphyria, and both uroporphyrin I and uroporphyrin III are excreted in porphyria cutanea tarda. Uroporphyrin I and III are the most common isomers. Under certain conditions, uroporphyrin I can act as a phototoxin, a neurotoxin, and a metabotoxin. A phototoxin leads to cell damage upon exposure to light. A neurotoxin causes damage to nerve cells and nerve tissues. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of porphyrins are associated with porphyrias such as porphyria variegate, acute intermittent porphyria, porphyria cutanea tarda, and hereditary coproporphyria (HCP). There are several types of porphyrias (most are inherited). Hepatic porphyrias are characterized by acute neurological attacks (seizures, psychosis, extreme back and abdominal pain, and an acute polyneuropathy), while the erythropoietic forms present with skin problems (usually a light-sensitive blistering rash and increased hair growth). The neurotoxicity of porphyrins may be due to their selective interactions with tubulin, which disrupt microtubule formation and cause neural malformations (PMID: 3441503).",Uroporphyrin I,HMDB0000936,,,C05767,UROPORPHYRIN_I,FDB022326,C05767,[H]N1\C2=C([H])/C3=N/C(=C([H])\C4=C(C(=C(N4[H])\C([H])=C4/N=C(/C(/[H])=C1/C(=C2C([H])([H])C([O-])=O)C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([O-])=O)C(=C4C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([O-])=O)C([H])([H])C([O-])=O)C([H])([H])C([O-])=O)C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([O-])=O)/C(=C3C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([O-])=O)C([H])([H])C([O-])=O,"2,7,12,17-Porphinetetrapropionic acid***3,8,13,18-Tetrakis(carboxymethyl)porphyrin-2,7,12,17-tetrapropionic acid***2,7,12,17-Porphinetetrapropionate***3,8,13,18-Tetrakis(carboxymethyl)porphyrin-2,7,12,17-tetrapropionate***3,3',3'',3'''-(3,8,13,18-tetrakis-carboxymethyl-21H,23H-porphine-2,7,12,17-tetrayl)-tetrakis-propionate***3,3',3'',3'''-(3,8,13,18-tetrakis-carboxymethyl-21H,23H-porphine-2,7,12,17-tetrayl)-tetrakis-propionic acid***3,3',3'',3'''-(3,8,13,18-tetrakis-carboxymethyl-porphyrin-2,7,12,17-tetrayl)-tetra-propionate***3,3',3'',3'''-(3,8,13,18-tetrakis-carboxymethyl-porphyrin-2,7,12,17-tetrayl)-tetra-propionic acid***3,8,13,18-Tetrakis(carboxymethyl)porphyrin-2,7,12,17-tetrapropanoate***3,8,13,18-Tetrakis(carboxymethyl)porphyrin-2,7,12,17-tetrapropanoic acid***3-[7,12,17-Tris-(2-carboxy-ethyl)-3,8,13,18-tetrakis-carboxymethyl-22,24-dihydro-porphin-2-yl]-propionate***3-[7,12,17-Tris-(2-carboxy-ethyl)-3,8,13,18-tetrakis-carboxymethyl-22,24-dihydro-porphin-2-yl]-propionic acid",DAFUFNRZWDWXJP-JRHDEHKPSA-F,"InChI=1S/C40H38N4O16/c45-33(46)5-1-17-21(9-37(53)54)29-14-26-19(3-7-35(49)50)23(11-39(57)58)31(43-26)16-28-20(4-8-36(51)52)24(12-40(59)60)32(44-28)15-27-18(2-6-34(47)48)22(10-38(55)56)30(42-27)13-25(17)41-29/h13-16,41,44H,1-12H2,(H,45,46)(H,47,48)(H,49,50)(H,51,52)(H,53,54)(H,55,56)(H,57,58)(H,59,60)/p-8/b25-13-,26-14-,27-15-,28-16-,29-14-,30-13-,31-16-,32-15-"
C05769,531-14-6,28421,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Coproporphyrin I is a porphyrin metabolite arising from heme synthesis. Porphyrins are pigments found in both animal and plant life. Coproporphyrin I is a tetrapyrrole dead-end product from the spontaneous oxidation of the methylene bridges of coproporphynogen, arising from heme synthesis and secreted in feces and urine. Increased levels of coproporphyrins can indicate congenital erythropoietic porphyria or sideroblastic anaemia. Porphyria is a pathological state characterised by abnormalities of porphyrin metabolism and results in the excretion of large quantities of porphyrins in the urine and in extreme sensitivity to light. A large number of factors are capable of increasing porphyrin excretion, owing to different and multiple causes and etiologies: 1) the main site of the chronic hepatic porphyria disease process concentrates on the liver, 2) a functional and morphologic liver injury is almost regularly associated with this chronic porphyria, 3) the toxic form due to occupational and environmental exposure takes mainly a subclinical course. Hepatic factors includes disturbance in coproporphyrinogen metabolism, which results from inhibition of coproporphyrinogen oxidase as well as from the rapid loss from, and diminished utilization of coproporphyrinogen in the hepatocytes, which may also explain why coproporphyrin, its autoxidation product, predominates physiologically in the urine; decreased biliary excretion of coproporphyrin leading to a compensatory urinary excretion, so that the coproporphyrin ring isomer ratio (1:III) becomes a sensitive index for impaired liver function and intrahepatic cholestasis; and disturbed activity of hepatic uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase. In itself, secondary coproporphyrinuria is not associated with porphyria symptoms of a hepatologic-gastroenterologic, neurologic, or dermatologic order, even though coproporphyrinuria can occur with such symptoms.

C05957,60203-57-8,27485,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Prostaglandin J2 (PGJ2) is an endogenous product of inflammation in humans. It induces neuronal death and the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins into distinct aggregates. It may play a role in neurodegenerative disorders inducing a chain of events that culminates in neuronal cell death. An altered expression of enzymes in PGJ2 synthesis may represent a novel pathogenic mechanism in human obesity. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR&#947;) has a fundamental role in glucose homeostasis and adipocyte differentiation. Besides linoleate, linolenate and arachidonate, the most notable PPAR ligand is 15-deoxy-delta12-14-prostaglandin J2, a natural derivative of prostaglandin D2 and PGJ2. It is therefore plausible that the production of 15d-PGJ2 within adipose tissue may act as an endogenous mediator of adipocyte differentiation. PGJ2 disrupts the cytoskeleton in neuronal cells. This cyclopentenone prostaglandin triggered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) collapse and the redistribution of ER proteins, such as calnexin and catechol-O-methyltransferase, into a large centrosomal aggregate containing ubiquitinated proteins and alpha-synuclein. The PGJ2-dependent cytoskeletal rearrangement paralleled the development of the large centrosomal aggregate. Supporting a mechanism by which, upon PGJ2 treatment, cytoskeleton/ER collapse coincides with the relocation of ER proteins, other potentially neighboring proteins, and ubiquitinated proteins into centrosomal aggregates. Development of these large perinuclear aggregates is associated with disruption of the microtubule/ER network. This aberrant protein deposition, triggered by a product of inflammation, may be common to other compounds that disrupt microtubules and induce protein aggregation, such as MPP+ and rotenone, found to be associated with neurodegeneration. Many neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson disease, exhibit inclusion bodies containing ubiquitinated proteins. Concentrations of PGJ2 in biofluids have not been established, since this prostaglandin is further metabolized into delta12-PGJ2, and 15-deoxy-delta12,14-PGJ2. (PMID: 16737963, 16842938, 16774923)Prostaglandins are eicosanoids. The eicosanoids consist of the prostaglandins (PGs), thromboxanes (TXs), leukotrienes (LTs) and lipoxins (LXs).

C06314,89663-86-5,6498,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Lipoxin A4 (LXA4) was first identified in 1984 by Serhan and colleagues as 5-lipoxygenase interaction product of activated leukocytes. Endogenous transcellular biosynthesis of LXA4 occurs via interaction of leukocytes with epithelium, endothelium or platelets. Lipoxins (LXs) or the lipoxygenase interaction products are generated from arachidonic acid via sequential actions of lipoxygenases and subsequent reactions to give specific trihydroxytetraene-containing eicosanoids. These unique structures are formed during cell-cell interactions and appear to act at both temporal and spatially distinct sites from other eicosanoids produced during the course of inflammatory responses and to stimulate natural resolution. Lipoxin A4 (LXA4) and lipoxin B4 (LXB4) are positional isomers that each possesses potent cellular and in vivo actions. These LX structures are conserved across species. The results of numerous studies reviewed in this work now confirm that they are the first recognized eicosanoid chemical mediators that display both potent anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving actions in vivo in disease models that include rabbit, rat, and mouse systems. LXs act at specific GPCRs as agonists to regulate cellular responses of interest in inflammation and resolution. Aspirin has a direct impact in the LX circuit by triggering the biosynthesis of endogenous epimers of LX, termed the aspirin-triggered 15-epi-LX, that share the potent anti-inflammatory actions of LX.

These endogenous eicosanoids have now emerged as founding members of the first class of lipid/chemical mediators involved in the resolution of the inflammatory response. Lipoxin A4 (LXA4), ATL, and their metabolic stable analogs elicit cellular responses and regulate leukocyte trafficking in vivo by activating the specific receptor, ALX. Many of the eicosanoids derived from arachidonic acid (AA2), including prostaglandins (PGs) and leukotrienes (LTs), play important roles as local mediators exerting a wide range of actions relevant in immune hypersensitivity and inflammation. However, recent observations indicate that other agents derived from the lipoxygenase (LO) pathways are formed and play a key role in initiating the resolution of acute inflammation. This phenomenon is an active process that is governed by specific lipid mediators and involves a series of well-orchestrated temporal events. Thus, potent locally released mediators serve as checkpoint controllers of inflammation. In addition to the well-appreciated ability of aspirin to inhibit PGs, aspirin also acetylates cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, triggering the formation of a 15-epimeric form of lipoxins, termed aspirin-triggered LXA4 (ATL). These eicosanoids (i.e., LXA4 and ATL) with a unique trihydroxytetraene structure function as 'stop signals' in inflammation and actively participate in dampening host responses to bring the inflammation to a close, namely, resolution.

Interest in the biological activity of AZA arose originally out of studies of skin surface lipids and the pathogenesis of hypochromia in pityriasis versicolor infection. Later, it was shown that Pityrosporum can oxidize unsaturated fatty acids to C8-C12 dicarboxylic acids that are cornpetitive inhibitors of tyrosinase in vitro. Azelaic acid was chosen for further investigation and development of a new topical drug for treating hyperpigmentary disorders for the following reasons: it possesses a middle-range of antityrosinase activity, is inexpensive, and more soluble to be incorporated into a base cream than other dicarboxylic acids. Azelaic acid is another option for the topical treatment of mild to moderate inflammatory acne vulgaris. It offers effectiveness similar to that of other agents without the systemic side effects of oral antibiotics or the allergic sensitization of topical benzoyl peroxide and with less irritation than tretinoin. Azelaic acid is less expensive than certain other prescription acne preparations, but it is much more expensive than nonprescription benzoyl peroxide preparations.

Picolinic acid is produced under inflammatory conditions and a costimulus with interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) of macrophage (Mphi) effector functions, is a selective inducer of the Mphi inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha) and -1beta (MIPs), two chemokines/cytokines involved in the elicitation of the inflammatory reactions and in the development of the Th1 responses. IFNgamma and picolinic acid have reciprocal effects on the production of MIPs chemokines and the expression of their receptor. The concerted action of IFNgamma and picolinic acid on MIP-1alpha/beta chemokine/receptor system is likely to be of pathophysiological significance and to represent an important regulatory mechanism for leukocyte recruitment and distribution into damaged tissues during inflammatory responses. Picolinic acid has an effect on the production of L-arginine-derived reactive nitrogen intermediates in macrophages, by augmenting IFN-gamma-induced NO2- production, and acts synergistically with IFN-gamma in activating macrophages. Children with acrodermatitis enteropathica (AE) are treated with oral zinc dipicolinate (zinc-PA). The concentration of picolinic acid in the plasma of asymptomatic children with AE was significantly less than that of normal children. However, oral treatment with PA alone is ineffective.

C11695,94421-68-8,2700,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Anandamide is a highly potent endogenous agonist of the cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors. CB1 receptors are predominantly found in the central nervous system (CNS) where they mainly mediate the psychotropic effects of Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and endocannabinoids, whereas the expression of the CB2 receptor is thought to be restricted to cells of the immune system. It was suggested that AEA might inhibit tumor cell proliferation or induce apoptosis independently of CB1 and CB2 receptors, via interaction with the type 1 vanilloid receptor (VR1). VR1 is an ion channel expressed almost exclusively by sensory neurons, activated by pH, noxious heat (>48 degree centigrade) and plant toxins and is thought to play an important role in nociception. Cervical cancer cells are sensitive to AEA-induced apoptosis via VR1 that is aberrantly expressed in vitro and in vivo while CB1 and CB2 receptors play a protective role. (PMID 15047233). Novel prostaglandins (prostaglandin glycerol esters and prostaglandin ethanolamides) are COX-2 oxidative metabolites of endogenous cannabinoids (such as Anandamide).

C13856,53847-30-6,52392,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): 2-Arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) is a unique molecular species of monoacylglycerol isolated in 1995 from rat brain and canine gut as an endogenous ligand for the cannabinoid receptors. 2-AG is rapidly formed from arachidonic acid-containing phospholipids through increased phospholipid metabolism, such as enhanced inositol phospholipid turnover, in various tissues and cells upon stimulation. 2-AG binds to the cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) and exhibits a variety of cannabimimetic activities in vitro and in vivo. 2-Arachidonylglycerol is an endogenous cannabinoid (endocannabinoid). Endocannabinoids are a class of fatty acid derivatives defined by their ability to interact with the specific cannabinoid receptors that were originally identified as the targets of Delta9-tetrahydocannabinol (Delta9-THC), the psychoactive component of cannabis. Endocannabinoids have been implicated in a growing number of important physiological and behavioral events. Endocannabinoids are amides, esters and ethers of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, which act as new lipidic mediators. 2-AG is one of the main endogenous agonists of cannabinoid receptors, able to mimic several pharmacological effects of (-)-Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active principle of Cannabis sativa preparations like hashish and marijuana. The activity of AEA and 2-AG at their receptors is limited by cellular uptake through an anandamide membrane transporter (AMT), followed by intracellular degradation. A fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) is the main AEA hydrolase, whereas a monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) is critical in degrading 2-AG.

C14770,81276-02-0,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): 11,12-Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid is an epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET). Induction of CYP2C8 in native coronary artery endothelial cells by beta-naphthoflavone enhances the formation of 11,12-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid, as well as endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor-mediated hyperpolarization and relaxation. Transfection of coronary arteries with CYP2C8 antisense oligonucleotides resulted in decreased levels of CYP2C and attenuated the endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor-mediated vascular responses. Thus, a CYP-epoxygenase product is an essential component of the endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor-mediated relaxation in the porcine coronary artery, and CYP2C8 fulfills the criteria for the coronary endothelium-derived hyperpolarization factor synthase. The role of EETs in regulation of the cerebral circulation has become more important, since it was realized that EETs are produced in another specialized cell type of the brain, the astrocytes. It has become evident that EETs released from astrocytes may mediate cerebral functional hyperemia. Molecular and pharmacological evidence hve shown that neurotransmitter release and spillover onto astrocytes can generate EETs. Since these EETs may reach the vasculature via astrocyte foot-processes, they have the same potential as their endothelial counterparts to hyperpolarize and dilate cerebral vessels. P450 enzymes contain heme in their catalytic domain and nitric oxide (NO) appears to bind to these heme moieties and block formation of P450 products, including EETs. Thus, there appears to be crosstalk between P450 enzymes and NO/NO synthase. The role of fatty acid metabolites and cerebral blood flow becomes even more complex in light of data demonstrating that cyclooxygenase products can act as substrates for P450 enzymes.

ca2,7440-70-2,29108,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Calcium is essential for the normal growth and maintenance of bones and teeth, and calcium requirements must be met throughout life. Requirements are greatest during periods of growth, such as childhood, during pregnancy and when breast-feeding. Long-term calcium deficiency can lead to osteoporosis, in which the bone deteriorates and there is an increased risk of fractures. Adults need between 1,000 and 1,300 mg of calcium in their daily diet. Calcium is essential for living organisms, particularly in cell physiology, and is the most common metal in many animals. Physiologically, it exists as an ion in the body. Calcium combines with phosphorus to form calcium phosphate in the bones and teeth. It is essential for the normal functioning of nerves and muscles and plays a role in blood coagulation (as factor IV) and in many enzymatic processes. Calcium is an important component of a healthy diet. A deficit can affect bone and tooth formation, while overretention can cause kidney stones. Vitamin D is needed to absorb calcium. Dairy products, such as milk and cheese, are a well-known source of calcium. However, some individuals are allergic to dairy products and even more people, particularly those of non-European descent, are lactose-intolerant, leaving them unable to consume dairy products. Fortunately, many other good sources of calcium exist. These include: seaweeds such as kelp, wakame and hijiki; nuts and seeds (like almonds and sesame); beans; amaranth; collard greens; okra; rutabaga; broccoli; kale; and fortified products such as orange juice and soy milk.

It is responsible for the orange colour of the carrot and many other fruits and vegetables. It contributes to photosynthesis by transmitting the light energy it absorbs to chlorophyll. Chemically, carotene is a terpene. It is the dimer of retinol (vitamin A) and comes in two primary forms: alpha- and beta-carotene. gamma-, delta- and epsilon-carotene also exist. Carotene can be stored in the liver and converted to vitamin A as needed. Beta-carotene is an anti-oxidant and such can be useful for curbing the excess of damaging free radicals in the body. However, the usefulness of beta-carotene as a dietary supplement (i.e. taken as a pill) is still subject to debate.

Its sulfonic acid is often present in the urine of many mammals. Small amounts of catechol occur naturally in fruits and vegetables, along with the enzyme polyphenol oxidase. Upon mixing the enzyme with the substrate and exposure to oxygen (as when a potato or apple is cut), the colorless catechol oxidizes to reddish-brown benzoquinone derivatives. The enzyme is inactivated by adding an acid, such as lemon juice, or by refrigeration. Excluding oxygen also prevents the browning reaction. Catechol melts at 28 oC and boils at 250 oC.

cbmt,,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Carbamic acid is occasionally found as carbamate in workers exposed to pesticides. Carbamates, particularly carbofuran, seem to be more associated with exuberant and diversified symptomatology of pesticide exposure than organophosphates. Neurological symptoms occur among farmers occupationally exposed to acetylcholinesterase-inhibiting insecticides such as carbamates. Carbamic acid products of several amines, such as beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA), ethylenediamine, and L-cysteine have been implicated in toxicity. Studies suggested that a significant portion of amino-compounds in biological samples (that naturally contain CO2/bicarbonate) can be present as a carbamic acid. The formation of carbamate glucuronide metabolites has been described for numerous pharmaceuticals and they have been identified in all of the species commonly used in drug metabolism studies (rat, dog, mouse, rabbit, guinea pig, and human). There has been no obvious species specificity for their formation and no preference for 1 or 2 degree amines. Many biological reactions have also been described in the literature that involve the reaction of CO2 with amino groups of biomolecules. For example, CO2 generated from cellular respiration is expired in part through the reversible formation of a carbamate between CO2 and the -amino groups of the alpha and beta-chains of hemoglobin. Glucuronidation is an important mechanism used by mammalian systems to clear and eliminate both endogenous and foreign chemicals. Many functional groups are susceptible to conjugation with glucuronic acid, including hydroxyls, phenols, carboxyls, activated carbons, thiols, amines, and selenium. Primary and secondary amines can also react with carbon dioxide (CO2) via a reversible reaction to form a carbamic acid. The carbamic acid is also a substrate for glucuronidation and results in a stable carbamate glucuronide metabolite. The detection and characterization of these products has been facilitated greatly by the advent of soft ionization mass spectrometry techniques and high field NMR instrumentation.

ccmuac,1119-72-8,16508,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Cis-cis-muconic acid is a presumptive metabolite of benzene. Muconic acid was first isolated from the urine of rabbits and dogs in 1909 ( M. Jaffe, Z Physiol Chem 62:58-67). It was originally thought that if muconic acid were formed by opening of the benzene ring in vivo then the cis-cis isomer should be the initial (and primary) product. However subsequent studies conducted in the 1950's proved that trans-trans-muconic acid is a true metabolite of benzene in mammals (Parke DV, Williams RT. Biochem J 51:339-348 (1952)). Furthermore, dosing rabbits with phenol or catechol also resulted in the urinary excretion of trans-trans-muconic acid. The oxidative ring opening of benzene first gives rise to cis-cis-muconaldehyde, which then isomerizes to cis-trans- and trans-trans-muconaldehyde; the latter is oxidized in vivo to trans-trans-muconic acid. Isomerization of the trans-trans form may take place in vivo to yield small amounts if the cis-cis and cis-trans form of muconic acid. Cis-cis muconic acid may also be generated from microbial fermentation of benzoic acid. Certain strains of arthobacter are particularly efficient at this process.","cis,cis-Muconic acid",HMDB0006331,,,C02480,,FDB023893,,,"(2Z,4Z)-HEXA-2,4-dienedioIC ACID***(Z,Z)-2,4-Hexadienedioic acid***cis,cis-2,4-Hexadienedioic acid***(2Z,4Z)-HEXA-2,4-dienedioate***cis,cis-Muconate***(Z,Z)-2,4-Hexadienedioate***cis,cis-2,4-Hexadienedioate***2,4-Hexadienedioate***2,4-Hexadienedioic acid***cis,cis-Hexadienedioate***cis,cis-Hexadienedioic acid***Muconic acid***Muconic acid, (e,e)-isomer***trans-beta-Hydromuconic acid***trans,trans-Muconic acid",TXXHDPDFNKHHGW-CCAGOZQPSA-N,"InChI=1S/C6H6O4/c7-5(8)3-1-2-4-6(9)10/h1-4H,(H,7,8)(H,9,10)/b3-1-,4-2-"
cd2,,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Cadmium (group IIB of the periodic table of elements) is a heavy metal. It is not a naturally occurring metal in biological systems. Cadmium poses severe risks to human health. Physiologically, it exists as an ion in the body. Up to this day, it has not been shown that cadmium has any physiological function within the human body. Interest has therefore risen in its biohazardous potential. As first described by Friedrich Stromeyer (Gottingen, Germany) in 1817, cadmium intoxication can lead to kidney, bone, and pulmonary damage. Cadmium is widely used in industrial processes, e.g as an anticorrosive agent, as a stabilizer in PVC products, as a colour pigment, a neutron absorber in nuclear power plants, and in the fabrication of nickel cadmium batteries. Phosphate fertilizers also show a big cadmium load. Although some cadmium containing products can be recycled, a large share of the general cadmium pollution is caused by dumping and incinerating cadmium polluted waste. In Scandinavia for example, cadmium concentration in agricultural soil increases by 0.2 percent per year. Total global emission of cadmium amounts to 7000 t/year. The maximum permissible value for workers according to German law is 15 ug/l. For comparison: Non-smokers show an average cadmium blood concentration of 0.5 ug/l. Basically there are three possible ways of cadmium resorption: Gastrointestinal, pulmonary and dermal. The uptake through the human gastrointestinal is approximately 5 percent of an ingested amount of cadmium, depending on the exact dose and nutritional composition. The major source of inhalative cadmium intoxication is cigarette smoke. The human lung resorbes 40 to 60 percent of the cadmium in tobacco smoke. Little research has been done on dermal absorption of cadmium. Two mechanisms facilitate cadmium absorption by the skin: binding of a free cadmium ion to sulfhydryl radicals of cysteine in epidermal keratins, or an induction and complexing with metallothionein. Once taken up by the blood, the majority of cadmium is transported bound to proteins, such as Albumin and Metallothionein. The first organ reached after cadmium uptake into the GI-blood is the liver. Here cadmium induces the production of Metallothionein. After consecutive hepatocyte necrosis and apoptosis, Cd-Metallothionein complexes are washed into sinusoidal blood. From here, parts of the absorbed cadmium enter the entero-hepatical cycle via secretion into the biliary tract in form of Cadmium-glutathione conjugates. Enzymatically degraded to cadmium-cysteine complexes in the biliary tree, cadmium reenters the small intestines. The main organ for long-term cadmium accumulation is the kidney. Here the half life period for cadmium is approximately 10 years. A life long intake can therefore lead to a cadmium accumulation in the kidney, consequently resulting in tubulus cell necrosis. The blood concentration of cadmium serves as a reliable indicator for a recent exposition, while the urinary concentration reflects past exposure, body burden and renal accumulation. Excretion of Cadmium takes place via faeces and urine. (PMID: 16961932).",Cadmium,HMDB0003638,,,,,,,,,,

cdpchol,987-78-0,16436,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Citicoline is an essential intermediate in the biosynthetic pathway of structural phospholipids in cell membranes, particularly phosphatidylcholine. Once absorbed, citicoline is widely distributed throughout the body, crosses the blood-brain barrier and reaches the central nervous system (CNS), where it is incorporated into the membrane and microsomal phospholipid fraction. Citicoline activates biosynthesis of structural phospholipids of neuronal membranes, increases brain metabolism, and acts upon the levels of different neurotransmitters. Thus, citicoline has been experimentally shown to increase norepinephrine and dopamine levels in the CNS. Owing to these pharmacological mechanisms, citicoline has a neuroprotective effect in hypoxic and ischemic conditions, decreasing the volume of ischemic lesion, and also improves learning and memory performance in animal models of brain aging. In addition, citicoline has been shown to restore the activity of mitochondrial ATPase and membrane Na+/K+ATPase, to inhibit activation of certain phospholipases, and to accelerate reabsorption of cerebral edema in various experimental models. Citicoline has also been shown to be able to inhibit mechanisms of apoptosis associated to cerebral ischemia and in certain neurodegeneration models, and to potentiate neuroplasticity mechanisms.

CE0074,50-71-5,730073,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Alloxan or mesoxalylurea is an organic compound based on a pyrimidine heterocyclic skeleton. This compound has a high affinity for water and therefore exists as the monohydrate. The compound was discovered by Justus von Liebig and Friedrich Wohler following the discovery of urea in 1828 and is one of the oldest named organic compounds that exist. The name is derived from allantoin, a product of uric acid excreted by the fetus into the allantois and oxaluric acid derived from oxalic acid and urea, found in urine. The original recipe for Alloxan was by oxidation of uric acid by nitric acid. Alloxan is a strong oxidizing agent and it forms a hemiacetal with its reduced reaction product dialuric acid (in which a carbonyl group is reduced to a hydroxyl group) which is called alloxantin. -- Wikipedia; Alloxane is a raw material for the production of the purple dye Murexide. Carl Wilhelm Scheele discovered the dye in 1776. Murexide is the product of the complex in-situ multistep reaction of alloxantin and gaseous ammonia. Murexide results from the condensation of the unisolated intermdiate uramil with alloxan, liberated during the course of the reaction. Scheele sourced uric acid from human calculi (such as kidney stones) and called the compound lithic acid. William Prout investigated the compound in 1818 and he used boa constrictor excrement with up to 90% ammonium acid urate. Liebig and Wohler in the nineteenth century coined the name murexide for the dye after the Trunculus Murex which is the source of the Tyrian purple of antiquity.

CE0737,542-78-9,566274,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Malondialdehyde (MDA) is the dialdehyde of malonic acid and a biomarker of oxidative damage to lipids caused by smoking. Oxidized lipids are able to produce MDA as a decomposition product. The mechanism is thought to involve formation of prostaglandin-like endoperoxides from polyunsaturated fatty acids with two or more double bonds. An alternative mechanism is based on successive hydroperoxide formation and &#946;-cleavage of polyunsaturated fatty acids. MDA is then directly formed by &#946;-scission of a 3-hydroperoxyaldehyde or by reaction between acrolein and hydroxyl radicals. While oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids is the major source of MDA in vivo, other minor sources exists such as byproducts of free radical generation by ionizing radiation and of the biosynthesis of prostaglandins. Aldehydes are generally reactive species capable of forming adducts and complexes in biological systems and MDA is no exception although the main species at physiological pH is the enolate ion which is of relative low reactivity. Consistent evidence is available for the reaction between MDA and cellular macromolecules such as proteins, RNA and DNA. MDA reacts with DNA to form adducts to deoxyguanosine and deoxyadenosine which may be mutagenic and these can be quantified in several human tissues. Oxidative stress is an imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants on a cellular or individual level. Oxidative damage is one result of such an imbalance and includes oxidative modification of cellular macromolecules, induction of cell death by apoptosis or necrosis, as well as structural tissue damage. Chemically speaking, oxidants are compounds capable of oxidizing target molecules. This can take place in three ways: abstraction of hydrogen, abstraction of electrons or addition of oxygen. All cells living under aerobic conditions are continuously exposed to a large numbers of oxidants derived from various endogenous and exogenous sources. The endogenous sources of oxidants are several and include the respiratory chain in the mitochondria, immune reactions, enzymes such as xanthine oxidase and nitric oxide synthase and transition metal mediated oxidation. Various exogenous sources of ROS also contribute directly or indirectly to the total oxidant load. These include effects of ionizing and non-ionizing radiation, air pollution and natural toxic gases such as ozone, and chemicals and toxins including oxidizing disinfectants. A poor diet containing inadequate amounts of nutrients may also indirectly result in oxidative stress by impairing cellular defense mechanisms. The cellular macromolecules, in particular lipids, proteins and DNA, are natural targets of oxidation. Oxidants are capable of initiating lipid oxidation by abstraction of an allylic proton from a polyunsaturated fatty acid. This process, by multiple stages leading to the formation of lipid hydroperoxides, is a known contributor to the development of atherosclerosis.

(A prostaglandin found in nearly all mammalian tissue that is a powerful vasodilator and inhibits platelet aggregation; it is biosynthesized enzymatically from prostaglandin endoperoxides in human vascular tissue; the sodium salt has been also used to treat primary pulmonary hypertension (Hypertension, Pulmonary). A delayed and prolonged increase in 6-keto-PGF1 alpha is reported in animals with septic shock, i.e., those with fecal peritonitis or cecal ligation. 6-keto-Prostaglandin F1a plasma levels has been found increased in patients with epidemic hemorrhagic fever, in patients with acute obstructive suppurative cholangitis, in patients with gynecologic cancer and has significant correlation with the level of high density lipoprotein cholesterol in plasma. (PMID 1976492, 2298410, 2379443, 2111556)Prostaglandins are eicosanoids. The eicosanoids consist of the prostaglandins (PGs), thromboxanes (TXs), leukotrienes (LTs) and lipoxins (LXs). The PGs and TXs are collectively identified as prostanoids. Prostaglandins were originally shown to be synthesized in the prostate gland, thromboxanes from platelets (thrombocytes) and leukotrienes from leukocytes, hence the derivation of their names. All mammalian cells except erythrocytes synthesize eicosanoids. These molecules are extremely potent, able to cause profound physiological effects at very dilute concentrations.

Urinary excretion of 5-hydroxytryptophol has also been shown to be markedly increased for several hours following intake of foods rich in serotonin, such as bananas. Wide interspecies variation has been reported in the metabolism serotonin to 5-hydroxytryptophol; 5-Hydroxytryptophol makes up 35% of the excreted serotonin metabolites in the rat on average and 10 to 20% in several other species. Human UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A6 (UGT1A6) plays a predominant role in the glucuronidation of 5-hydroxytryptophol by human liver microsomes.

CE1950,,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): The OSCN- ion inhibits bacterial glyceraldehyde 3-P dehydrogenases (11, 24) and. thereby stops the bacterial production of acids from sugars. The inhibition of bacterial acid production by OSCN- has been implicated as playing an important role in the prevention of dental caries. Lactoperoxidase in the presence of thiocyanate detoxifies hydrogen peroxide by converting it into OSCN-, and OSCN- prevents bacteria from excreting hydrogen peroxide by inhibiting glyceraldehyde 3-P dehydrogenase. Because of this inhibition, no NADH is generated in the bacteria, and the hydrogen peroxide-producing NADH oxidases become short of their substrate, NADH. This inhibition of glycolysis usually has a bacteriostatic effect. In recent studies, significant levels of OSCN- have been found in saliva collected directly from the ducts of the salivary glands. This indicates that hydrogen peroxide is actually produced within the salivary glands; thus, lactoperoxidase and thiocyanate may also play an important role in protecting the salivary glands and ducts against hydrogen peroxide toxicity. The products of the lactoperoxidase-thiocyanate-hydrogen peroxide reaction have also been reported to be bactericidal. This effect has been ascribed to OSCN-, but it has also been suggested that higher oxyacids of the thiocyanate ion, cyanosulfurous and cyanosulfuric acids, may be formed in the lactoperoxidase reaction, and these acids may be the effective molecular species in the. killing.",Cyanosulfurous acid anion,HMDB0012916,,,,,FDB029207,CE1950,[H]O[S](O[H])C#N,CNSu***Cyanosulfurous acid,QYFNKYSGTDITHU-UHFFFAOYSA-N,InChI=1S/CH2NO2S/c2-1-5(3)4/h3-4H

Overexpression of the Alpha class GSTs in cells leads to lower steady-state levels of HNE, and these cells acquire resistance to apoptosis induced by lipid peroxidation-causing agents such as H(2)O(2), UVA, superoxide anion, and pro-oxidant xenobiotics, suggesting that signaling for apoptosis by these agents is transduced through HNE. Cells with the capacity to exclude HNE from the intracellular environment at a faster rate are relatively more resistant to apoptosis caused by H(2)O(2), UVA, superoxide anion, and pro-oxidant xenobiotics as well as by HNE, suggesting that HNE may be a common denominator in mechanisms of apoptosis caused by oxidative stress.

CE2028,625-08-1,37084,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): 3-Hydroxyisovaleric acid is a normal human metabolite excreted in the urine. It is a byproduct of the leucine degradation pathway. Production of 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid begins with the conversion of 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA into 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA in the mitochondria by the biotin-dependent enzyme methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase. Biotin deficiencies, certain lifestyle habits (smoking), or specific genetic conditions can reduce methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase activity. This reduction can lead to a buildup of 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA, which is converted into 3-hydroxyisovaleryl-CoA by the enzyme enoyl-CoA hydratase. Increased concentrations of 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA and 3-hydroxyisovaleryl-CoA can lead to a disruption of the esterified CoA:free CoA ratio, and ultimately to mitochondrial toxicity. Detoxification of these metabolic end products occur via the transfer of the 3-hydroxyisovaleryl moiety to carnitine forming 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid-carnitine or 3HIA-carnitine, which is then transferred across the inner mitochondrial membrane where 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid is released as the free acid (PMID: 21918059). 3-Hydroxyisovaleric acid has been found to be elevated in smokers and in subjects undergoing long-term anticonvulsant therapy with carbamazepine and/or phenytoin. These levels are elevated due to impairment of renal reclamation of biotin. Levels may also be increased from prolonged consumption of raw egg-whites (PMID: 16895887, 9523856, 15447901, 9176832) (OMIM: 210210, 253270, 600529, 253260, 246450, 210200, 238331). When present in sufficiently high levels, 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid can act as an acidogen and a metabotoxin. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid are associated with at least a dozen inborn errors of metabolism, including 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency, 3-methylglutaconic aciduria type I, biotinidase deficiency and isovaleric aciduria, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase deficiency, 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase 1 deficiency, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency, late-onset multiple carboxylase deficiency, holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency, and 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase 2 deficiency. 3-Hydroxyisovaleric acid is an organic acid. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart, liver, and kidney abnormalities, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of the untreated IEMs mentioned above. Many affected children with organic acidemias experience intellectual disability or delayed development.

However, 2-hydroxyestrone has a weak estrogenic activity and breast cancer risks are quite low in women with high urinary excretion of 2-hydroxyestrone. 2-Hydroxy-3-methoxyestrone levels in urine could be an indicator to help assess the risk factors for development of breast cancers.",2-Hydroxy-3-methoxyestrone,HMDB0011195,,,,,FDB021866,,[H]OC1=C([H])C2=C(C([H])=C1OC([H])([H])[H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C1([H])C3([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C(=O)[C@]3(C([H])([H])[H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C21[H],3-Hydroxy-9(Z)-octadecenoylcarnitine,YBCPNMOFBUWYTP-ACOLZQMSSA-N,"InChI=1S/C19H24O3/c1-19-8-7-12-13(15(19)5-6-18(19)21)4-3-11-9-17(22-2)16(20)10-14(11)12/h9-10,12-13,15,20H,3-8H2,1-2H3/t12?,13?,15?,19-/m1/s1"

During hypocalcemia or hypovitaminosis D, 25-OH-D3 is 1alpha-hydroxylated, primarily in kidney, to produce 1,25-(OH)2D3. 1,25-(OH)2D3 is a hormonally active form of vitamin D3 that enhances intestinal calcium transport and promotes mobilization of calcium from bone. In states of vitamin D excess, other pathways of 25-OH-D3 metabolism emerge as alternatives to 1-and 24-hydroxylation. Recently, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-26,23-lactone (lactone) was identified as a major plasma metabolite in animals receiving large doses of vitamin D. Although the function of the lactone is not known, its 5-fold greater potency of binding to the plasma vitamin D carrier protein, relative to 25-OH-D3, suggests that it may, perhaps indirectly, contribute to vitamin D toxicity. This indicates the existence of an alternate route to lactone formation through a new 25-OH-D3 metabolite, 23,25-(OH)2D3.

CE2414,14721-66-5,16285,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Phytanic acid (or 3,7,11,15-tetramethylhexadecanoic acid) is a 20-carbon branched-chain fatty acid that humans can obtain through the consumption of dairy products, ruminant animal fats, and certain fish. It is primarily formed by bacterial degradation of chlorophyll in the intestinal tract of ruminants. Unlike most fatty acids, phytanic acid cannot be metabolized by beta-oxidation (because of a methyl group in the beta position). Instead, it undergoes alpha-oxidation in the peroxisome, where it is converted into pristanic acid by the removal of one carbon. Pristanic acid can undergo several rounds of beta-oxidation in the peroxisome to form medium-chain fatty acids that can be converted into carbon dioxide and water in mitochondria. Refsum disease, an autosomal recessive neurological disorder caused by mutations in the PHYH gene, is characterized by having impaired alpha-oxidation activity. Individuals with Refsum disease accumulate large stores of phytanic acid in their blood and tissues. This frequently leads to peripheral polyneuropathy, cerebellar ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa, anosmia, and hearing loss. Therefore, chronically high levels of phytanic acid can be neurotoxic. Phytanic acid's neurotoxicity appears to lie in its ability to initiate astrocyte/neural cell death by activating the mitochondrial route of apoptosis. In particular, phytanic acid can induce the substantial generation of reactive oxygen species in isolated mitochondria as well as in intact cells. It also induces the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria.",Phytanic acid,HMDB0000801,,,C01607,,FDB022252,,[H]C([H])([H])C([H])(C([H])([H])[H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])(C([H])([H])[H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])(C([H])([H])[H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])(C([H])([H])[H])C([H])([H])C([O-])=O,"3,7,11,15-Tetramethyl hexadecanoic acid***3,7,11,15-Tetramethyl-hexadecanoic acid***3,7,11,15-Tetramethyl-hexadecansaeure***3,7,11,15-Tetramethyl hexadecanoate***Phytanate***3,7,11,15-Tetramethyl-hexadecanoate***3,7,11,15-Tetramethylhexadecanoate***3,7,11,15-Tetramethylhexadecanoic acid***3,7,11,15-Tetramethylhexadecoanoate***3,7,11,15-Tetramethylhexadecoanoic acid***Phytanoate***Phytanoic acid***Acid, phytanic",RLCKHJSFHOZMDR-UHFFFAOYSA-M,"InChI=1S/C20H40O2/c1-16(2)9-6-10-17(3)11-7-12-18(4)13-8-14-19(5)15-20(21)22/h16-19H,6-15H2,1-5H3,(H,21,22)/p-1"

A greater increase in LTB4 and 6-trans-LTB4 (one of its hydroxylated 5-lipoxygenase metabolic derivatives) occurs after stimulation with calcium-ionophore in asthma patients compared to healthy controls. LTB4 is the major metabolite in neutrophil polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Leukotrienes are metabolites of arachidonic acid derived from the action of 5-LO (5-lipoxygenase). The immediate product of 5-LO is LTA4 (leukotriene A4), which is enzymatically converted into either LTB4 (leukotriene B4) by LTA4 hydrolase or LTC4 (leukotriene C4) by LTC4 synthase. The regulation of leukotriene production occurs at various levels, including expression of 5-LO, translocation of 5-LO to the perinuclear region and phosphorylation to either enhance or inhibit the activity of 5-LO. Biologically active LTB4 is metabolized by w-oxidation carried out by specific cytochrome P450s (CYP4F) followed by beta-oxidation from the w-carboxy position and after CoA ester formation.

In physiological literature, it is given the name 20:3(n-6). DGLA is the elongation product of the 18 carbon gamma-linolenic acid (GLA). DGLA can be converted into prostaglandin E1 (PGE1). PGE1 inhibits platelet aggregation and also exerts a vasodilatory effect.

However, the excretion of certain acyl glycines is increased in several inborn errors of metabolism. In certain cases the measurement of these metabolites in body fluids can be used to diagnose disorders associated with mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation. Acyl glycines are produced through the action of glycine N-acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.13) which is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction:. acyl-CoA + glycine < -- > CoA + N-acylglycine. Methylhippuric acid is a metabolite of xylene which is an aromatic hydrocarbon widely used as a solvant.

CE3481,,78209,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): LPA(0:0/20:4n6) is a lysophosphatidic acid. It is a glycerophospholipid in which a phosphate moiety occupies a glycerol substitution site. Lysophosphatidic acids can have different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached at the C-1 (sn-1) or C-2 (sn-2) position. Fatty acids containing 16 and 18 carbons are the most common. Lysophosphatidic acid is the simplest possible glycerophospholipid. It is the biosynthetic precursor of phosphatidic acid. Although it is present at very low levels only in animal tissues, it is extremely important biologically, influencing many biochemical processes. In particular, lysophosphatidic acid is an intercellular lipid mediator with growth factor-like activities, and is rapidly produced and released from activated platelets to influence target cells.LPA is a pluripotent lipid mediator controlling growth, motility, and differentiation, that has a strong influence on the chemotaxis and ultrastructure of human neutrophils (PMID 7416233). In serum and plasma, LPA is mainly converted from lysophospholipids, whereas in platelets and some cancer cells it is converted from phosphatidic acid. In each pathway, at least two phospholipase activities are required: phospholipase A1 (PLA1)/PLA2 plus lysophospholipase D (lysoPLD) activities are involved in the first pathway and phospholipase D (PLD) plus PLA1/PLA2 activities are involved in the second pathway.

Acyl-CoA (or formyl-CoA) is a coenzyme involved in the metabolism of fatty acids. It is a temporary compound formed when coenzyme A (CoA) attaches to the end of a long-chain fatty acid inside living cells. The compound undergoes beta oxidation, forming one or more molecules of acetyl-CoA.

CE4872,,16466,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): 3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-Trihydroxy-5beta-cholestan-26-al is an intermediate in bile acid biosynthesis. Bile acids are steroid acids found predominantly in bile of mammals. The distinction between different bile acids is minute, depends only on presence or absence of hydroxyl groups on positions 3, 7, and 12. Bile acids are physiological detergents that facilitate excretion, absorption, and transport of fats and sterols in the intestine and liver. Bile acids are also steroidal amphipathic molecules derived from the catabolism of cholesterol. They modulate bile flow and lipid secretion, are essential for the absorption of dietary fats and vitamins, and have been implicated in the regulation of all the key enzymes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Bile acids recirculate through the liver, bile ducts, small intestine and portal vein to form an enterohepatic circuit. They exist as anions at physiological pH and, consequently, require a carrier for transport across the membranes of the enterohepatic tissues. The unique detergent properties of bile acids are essential for the digestion and intestinal absorption of hydrophobic nutrients. Bile acids have potent toxic properties (e.g., membrane disruption) and there are a plethora of mechanisms to limit their accumulation in blood and tissues.

In certain cases the measurement of these metabolites in body fluids can be used to diagnose disorders associated with mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation. Acyl glycines are produced through the action of glycine N-acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.13) which is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction: acyl-CoA + glycine < -- > CoA + N-acylglycine. The isolated excretion of high levels of 2-methylbutyrylglycine (2-MBG) is the hallmark of short/branched-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency or SBCADD (PMID:15615815). The disorder is also called 2-methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (PMID: 17883863) and has been associated with autism and mental retardation. SBCADD is a recently described autosomal recessive disorder caused by a defect in the degradation pathway of L- isoleucine leading to increased urinary excretion of 2-methylbutyryl glycine. The enzymatic defect results from disruption of the SBCAD gene. Deficiency of SBCAD leads to accumulation of its substrate, 2-methylbutyryl-CoA within the mitochondrion. This substance is transesterified with glycine by the mitochondrial enzyme acyl-CoA glycine-N-acyltransferase (glycine-N-acylase) to form 2-methylbutyryl glycine. Affected patients can be divided into two categories. The first category consists of infants detected by newborn screening programmes.

CE4980,,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): GE2 glycerol ester is a COX-2 oxidative metabolite of 2-arachidonoyl glycerol, modulates inhibitory synaptic transmission in mouse hippocampal neurons. 2-Arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) has been isolated from porcine brain,1 and has been characterized as the natural endocannabinoid ligand for the CB1 receptor.2 Incubation of 2-AG with COX-2 and specific prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) isomerases in cell cultures and isolated enzyme preparations results in prostaglandin glycerol ester formation.3 The biosynthesis of PGH, PGD, PGE, PGF, and TXA-2-glyceryl ester compounds have all been documented. The 2-glyceryl ester moiety equilibrates rapidly (within minutes) with the more stable 1-glyceryl ester, producing a 10:90 2:1-glyceryl ester mixture in typical aqueous media. While the stability and metabolism of these prostaglandin products has been investigated,4 little is known about their intrinsic biological activity. Prostaglandins are eicosanoids. The eicosanoids consist of the prostaglandins (PGs), thromboxanes (TXs), leukotrienes (LTs) and lipoxins (LXs). The PGs and TXs are collectively identified as prostanoids. Prostaglandins were originally shown to be synthesized in the prostate gland, thromboxanes from platelets (thrombocytes) and leukotrienes from leukocytes, hence the derivation of their names. All mammalian cells except erythrocytes synthesize eicosanoids. These molecules are extremely potent, able to cause profound physiological effects at very dilute concentrations. All eicosanoids function locally at the site of synthesis, through receptor-mediated G-protein linked signaling pathways.",Prostaglandin PGE2 glyceryl ester,HMDB0013045,,,,,FDB029268,,[H]OC([H])([H])C([H])(OC(=O)C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C(\[H])=C(\[H])C([H])([H])[C@]1([H])C(=O)C([H])([H])[C@]([H])(O[H])[C@@]1([H])C(\[H])=C(/[H])[C@@]([H])(O[H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])[H])C([H])([H])O[H],,HJWDPZIOTMUWRW-KSGZNQJUSA-N,"InChI=1S/C23H38O7/c1-2-3-6-9-17(26)12-13-20-19(21(27)14-22(20)28)10-7-4-5-8-11-23(29)30-18(15-24)16-25/h4,7,12-13,17-20,22,24-26,28H,2-3,5-6,8-11,14-16H2,1H3/b7-4-,13-12+/t17-,19-,20-,22-/m0/s1"

CE5122,146622-45-9,15538,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Phytanoyl CoA is a coenzyme A derivative of phytanic acid. Phytanic acid is present in human diet or in animal tissues where it may be derived from chlorophyll in plant extracts. Specifically it is an epimeric metabolite of the isoprenoid side chain of chlorophyll. Owing to the presence of its epimeric beta-methyl group, phytanic acid cannot be metabolized by beta-oxidation. Instead, it is metabolized in peroxisomes via alpha-oxidation to give pristanic acid, which is then oxidized by beta-oxidation. PhyH (phytanoyl-CoA 2-hydroxylase) catalyses hydroxylation of phytanoyl-CoA. Mutations of PhyH can lead to phytanic acid accumulation. High levels of phytanic acid are found in patients suffering from Refsum's syndrome. This inherited neurological disorder is characterized by an accumulation of phytanic acid in blood and tissues. Clinically it is characterized by adult onset retinitis pigmentosa, anosmia, sensory neuropathy, and phytanic acidaemia. This disorder has been found to be related to deficiency in the &#945;-oxidation pathway in the liver. (PMID: 17956235). Phytanoyl CoA and other branched-chain fatty acid CoA products are potent inducers of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor PPARalpha, a nuclear receptor that enhances transcription of peroxisomal enzymes mediating beta-oxidation of these potentially toxic fatty acids (PMID: 16768463). Pyruvate dehydrogenase and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase are strongly inhibited by phytanoyl-CoA. Decreased activity of these important mitochondrial metabolism complexes might therefore contribute to neurological symptoms upon accumulation of phytanic acid in Refsum disease (PMID: 16737698).",Phytanoyl-CoA,HMDB0001359,,,C02060,CPD-206,FDB022577,,[H]OC([H])(C(=O)N([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C(=O)N([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])SC(=O)C([H])([H])C([H])(C([H])([H])[H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])[C@]([H])(C([H])([H])[H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])[C@]([H])(C([H])([H])[H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])(C([H])([H])[H])C([H])([H])[H])C(C([H])([H])[H])(C([H])([H])[H])C([H])([H])OP([O-])(=O)OP([O-])(=O)OC([H])([H])C1([H])O[C@]([H])(N2C([H])=NC3=C2N=C([H])N=C3N([H])[H])C([H])(O[H])C1([H])OP([O-])([O-])=O,"3,7,11,15-Tetramethyl hexadecanoyl CoA***3,7,11,15-Tetramethyl hexadecanoyl coenzyme A***Phytanoyl CoA***Phytanoyl coenzyme A***Phytanoyl-coenzyme A***Phytanyl CoA***Phytanyl coenzyme A",NRJQGHHZMSOUEN-BJETZBMBSA-J,"InChI=1S/C41H74N7O17P3S/c1-26(2)11-8-12-27(3)13-9-14-28(4)15-10-16-29(5)21-32(50)69-20-19-43-31(49)17-18-44-39(53)36(52)41(6,7)23-62-68(59,60)65-67(57,58)61-22-30-35(64-66(54,55)56)34(51)40(63-30)48-25-47-33-37(42)45-24-46-38(33)48/h24-30,34-36,40,51-52H,8-23H2,1-7H3,(H,43,49)(H,44,53)(H,57,58)(H,59,60)(H2,42,45,46)(H2,54,55,56)/p-4/t27-,28-,29?,30?,34?,35?,36?,40+/m0/s1"

CE5126,300-85-6,20067,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): 3-Hydroxybutyric acid (or beta-hydroxybutyrate) is a ketone body. Like the other ketone bodies (acetoacetate and acetone), levels of 3-hydroxybutyrate in blood and urine are raised in ketosis. In humans, 3-hydroxybutyrate is synthesized in the liver from acetyl-CoA, and can be used as an energy source by the brain when blood glucose is low. Blood levels of 3-Hydroxybutyric acid levels may be monitored in diabetic patients to look for diabetic ketoacidosis. Persistent mild hyperketonemia is a common finding in newborns. Ketone bodies serve as an indispensable source of energy for extrahepatic tissues, especially the brain and lung of developing mammals. Another important function of ketone bodies is to provide acetoacetyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA for synthesis of cholesterol, fatty acids, and complex lipids. During the early postnatal period, acetoacetate (AcAc) and beta-hydroxybutyrate are preferred over glucose as substrates for synthesis of phospholipids and sphingolipids in accord with requirements for brain growth and myelination. Thus, during the first 2 weeks of postnatal development, when the accumulation of cholesterol and phospholipids accelerates, the proportion of ketone bodies incorporated into these lipids increases. On the other hand, an increased proportion of ketone bodies is utilized for cerebroside synthesis during the period of active myelination. In the lung, AcAc serves better than glucose as a precursor for the synthesis of lung phospholipids. The synthesized lipids, particularly dipalmityl phosphatidylcholine, are incorporated into surfactant, and thus have a potential role in supplying adequate surfactant lipids to maintain lung function during the early days of life (PMID 3884391). 3-Hydroxybutyric acid is found to be associated with fumarase deficiency and medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, which are inborn errors of metabolism.",3-Hydroxybutyric acid,HMDB0000357,,,C01089,CPD-335,FDB021797,CE5126,[H]OC([H])(C(=O)N([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C(=O)N([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])SC(=O)C([H])(C([H])([H])[H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])(C([H])([H])[H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])(C([H])([H])[H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])(C([H])([H])[H])C([H])([H])[H])C(C([H])([H])[H])(C([H])([H])[H])C([H])([H])OP([O-])(=O)OP([O-])(=O)OC([H])([H])C1([H])O[C@]([H])(N2C([H])=NC3=C2N=C([H])N=C3N([H])[H])C([H])(O[H])C1([H])OP([O-])([O-])=O,(1)-3-Hydroxybutyric acid***3 HBA***3-Hydroxybuttersaeure***3-OH-Butyric acid***beta-Hydroxy-N-butyric acid***beta-Hydroxybutanoic acid***beta-Hydroxybuttersaeure***beta-Hydroxybutyric acid***BHBA***DL-beta-Hydroxybutyric acid***(1)-3-Hydroxybutyrate***3-Hydroxybutyrate***3-OH-Butyrate***b-Hydroxy-N-butyrate***b-Hydroxy-N-butyric acid***beta-Hydroxy-N-butyrate***β-hydroxy-N-butyrate***β-hydroxy-N-butyric acid***b-Hydroxybutanoate***b-Hydroxybutanoic acid***beta-Hydroxybutanoate***β-hydroxybutanoate***β-hydroxybutanoic acid***b-Hydroxybuttersaeure***β-hydroxybuttersaeure***b-Hydroxybutyrate***b-Hydroxybutyric acid***beta-Hydroxybutyrate***β-hydroxybutyrate***β-hydroxybutyric acid***DL-b-Hydroxybutyrate***DL-b-Hydroxybutyric acid***DL-beta-Hydroxybutyrate***DL-β-hydroxybutyrate***DL-β-hydroxybutyric acid***3-Hydroxy-butanoate***3-Hydroxy-butanoic acid***3-Hydroxy-butyrate***3-Hydroxy-butyric acid***3-Hydroxybutanoate***3-Hydroxybutanoic acid***Biopol***DL-3-Hydroxybutyrate***DL-3-Hydroxybutyric acid***beta Hydroxybutyric acid***3 Hydroxybutyric acid***beta Hydroxybutyrate***(+ -)-3-Hydroxybutyric acid***3 Hydroxybutyrate,XYJPSQPVCBNZHT-QWDPMMQESA-J,"InChI=1S/C40H72N7O17P3S/c1-25(2)11-8-12-26(3)13-9-14-27(4)15-10-16-28(5)39(52)68-20-19-42-30(48)17-18-43-37(51)34(50)40(6,7)22-61-67(58,59)64-66(56,57)60-21-29-33(63-65(53,54)55)32(49)38(62-29)47-24-46-31-35(41)44-23-45-36(31)47/h23-29,32-34,38,49-50H,8-22H2,1-7H3,(H,42,48)(H,43,51)(H,56,57)(H,58,59)(H2,41,44,45)(H2,53,54,55)/p-4/t26?,27?,28?,29?,32?,33?,34?,38-/m0/s1"

CE5169,,27379,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): 3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-Trihydroxy-5beta-24-oxocholestanoyl-CoA is an intermediate in bile acid synthesis. Bile acids are steroid acids found predominantly in bile of mammals. The distinction between different bile acids is minute, depends only on presence or absence of hydroxyl groups on positions 3, 7, and 12. Bile acids are physiological detergents that facilitate excretion, absorption, and transport of fats and sterols in the intestine and liver. Bile acids are also steroidal amphipathic molecules derived from the catabolism of cholesterol. They modulate bile flow and lipid secretion, are essential for the absorption of dietary fats and vitamins, and have been implicated in the regulation of all the key enzymes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Bile acids recirculate through the liver, bile ducts, small intestine and portal vein to form an enterohepatic circuit. They exist as anions at physiological pH and, consequently, require a carrier for transport across the membranes of the enterohepatic tissues. The unique detergent properties of bile acids are essential for the digestion and intestinal absorption of hydrophobic nutrients. Bile acids have potent toxic properties (e.g., membrane disruption) and there are a plethora of mechanisms to limit their accumulation in blood and tissues.

CE5350,,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): 6,7-dihydro-12-epi-LTB4 is formed when leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is metabolized by beta-oxidation. LTB4 is the major metabolite in neutrophil polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Leukotrienes are metabolites of arachidonic acid derived from the action of 5-LO (5-lipoxygenase). The immediate product of 5-LO is LTA4 (leukotriene A4), which is enzymatically converted into either LTB4 (leukotriene B4) by LTA4 hydrolase or LTC4 (leukotriene C4) by LTC4 synthase. The regulation of leukotriene production occurs at various levels, including expression of 5-LO, translocation of 5-LO to the perinuclear region and phosphorylation to either enhance or inhibit the activity of 5-LO. Biologically active LTB4 is metabolized by w-oxidation carried out by specific cytochrome P450s (CYP4F) followed by beta-oxidation from the w-carboxy position and after CoA ester formation. (PMID: 8632343, 9667737). Leukotrienes are eicosanoids. The eicosanoids consist of the prostaglandins (PGs), thromboxanes (TXs), leukotrienes (LTs) and lipoxins (LXs). The PGs and TXs are collectively identified as prostanoids. Prostaglandins were originally shown to be synthesized in the prostate gland, thromboxanes from platelets (thrombocytes) and leukotrienes from leukocytes, hence the derivation of their names. All mammalian cells except erythrocytes synthesize eicosanoids. These molecules are extremely potent, able to cause profound physiological effects at very dilute concentrations. All eicosanoids function locally at the site of synthesis, through receptor-mediated G-protein linked signaling pathways.","6,7-dihydro-12-epi-LTB4",HMDB0012838,,,,,FDB029182,,[H]OC(=O)C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])[C@@]([H])(O[H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C(\[H])=C(/[H])\C(\[H])=C(/[H])[C@]([H])(O[H])C([H])([H])C(\[H])=C(\[H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])[H],"(5S,12S)-Dihydroxy-(8E,10E,14Z)-eicosatrienoate***(5S,12S)-Dihydroxy-(8E,10E,14Z)-eicosatrienoic acid***5S12SECtr***6,7-dihydro-12-Epi-leukotriene b(,4)",ZMZNVSWCIRFLBV-GRXSAWGRSA-N,"InChI=1S/C20H34O4/c1-2-3-4-5-6-9-13-18(21)14-10-7-8-11-15-19(22)16-12-17-20(23)24/h6-10,14,18-19,21-22H,2-5,11-13,15-17H2,1H3,(H,23,24)/b8-7+,9-6-,14-10+/t18-,19+/m1/s1"

This receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor with seven transmembrane spanning regions, hence the receptor is also denoted as a 7 transmembrane receptor (7-TMR). Upon binding several intracellular signaling pathways are triggered (see Figure 2). Neuromedin B (NMB) is a bombesin-related peptide in mammals.

Synthetic a-tocopherols are a racemic mixture of eight different R and S stereoisomers. Only the 2R forms are recognized as meeting human requirements. The in vivo function of vitamin E is to scavenge peroxyl radicals via its phenolic (chromanol) hydroxyl group, thus protecting lipids against free radical-catalyzed peroxidation.

CE6205,712-09-4,114833,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): 5-Methoxytryptophol is synthesized by the pineal gland. Daily rhythms in pineal methoxyindole metabolism have been described in rodents and humans (5-Methoxytryptophol levels are coincident with serotonin levels in rodents pineal) and 5-Methoxytryptophol at its highest during the daylight hours and fall markedly soon after the onset of darkness, coincident with increases in the levels of pineal melatonin and the activities of pineal serotonin-N-acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.87, SNAT) and hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.4, HIOMT). The fact that the levels of 5-methoxytryptophol and melatonin vary in parallel suggests that the major factor generating the methoxyindole rhythms is not SNAT activity, but perhaps a change in the availability (for metabolism) of ""stored"" serotonin. When the onset of darkness is delayed by 12 hours, human 5-methoxytryptophol (and melatonin) rhythms usually require 3 or 4 days to adjust to the new lighting regimen. Environmental factors, other than light, that activate the sympathetic nervous system or cause epinephrine to be secreted from the adrenal medulla (e.g., the stress of immobilization; insulin-induced hypoglycemia) can override the inhibitory effects of light and accelerate melatonin synthesis. Rhythms in 5-methoxytryptophol (and melatonin) synthesis apparently persist among animals placed in environments of continuous darkness; the source of the cyclic signal (mediated by the pineal sympathetic nerves) has not yet been identified. Preliminary evidence suggests that levels of a peptide hormone, arginine vasotocin, in rat pineal and sera also exhibit daily rhythms and are increased by norepinephrine. The circadian rhythm of melatonin secretion is generated in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Sleep disruption, nightly restlessness, sundowning, and other circadian disturbances are frequently seen in Alzheimer's disease patients. Changes in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and pineal gland are thought to be the biological basis for these behavioral disturbances.

cgly,19246-18-5,4047,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Cysteinylglycine is a naturally occurring dipeptide. It is derived from the breakdown of glutathione (a tripeptide). In plasma, cysteinylglycine is in a reduced, oxidized and protein-bound form (aminothiol) and interact via redox and disulphide exchange reactions, in a dynamic system referred to as redox thiol status (PMID 8642471). Spermatozoa of sub fertile men contain significantly higher thiol concentrations as compared with those of fertile men. The detrimental effect on embryo quality of a high homocysteine (Hcy, another member of the thiol group) concentration in the ejaculate and in follicular fluid is intriguing and may suggest that Hcy is inversely associated with fertility outcome (PMID 16556671). Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease which involves the synovial membrane of multiple diarthroidal joints causing damage to cartilage and bones. The damage process seems to be related to an overproduction of oxygen reactive species inducing an oxidative perturbation with an increase in some oxidized forms (disulfides and protein mixed disulfides) and a decrease in free thiols (PMID 15895891). Imipenem (thienamycin formamidine), is a broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotic, always used in combination with cilastatin in order to avoid the premature breakdown of imipenem by renal tubular dipeptidase. As this dipeptidase also hydrolyzes the glutathione metabolite cysteinylglycine, the therapeutic association of imipenem and cilastatin causes plasma levels of cysteinylglycine to increase significantly, while cysteine levels are decreased and homocysteine levels are unaffected. Therefore, antibiotic treatment using imipenem-cilastatin induces important metabolic changes that should not remain unrecognized (PMID 15843241). Moreover, cysteinylglycine is found to be associated with phenylketonuria, which is an inborn error of metabolism.",Cysteinylglycine,HMDB0000078,,,C01419,GLUTATHIONE,FDB021891,cgly,[H]SC([H])([H])[C@@]([H])(C(=O)N([H])C([H])([H])C([O-])=O)[N+]([H])([H])[H],CG***Cys-gly***N-L-Cysteinylglycine***L-Cysteinylglycine***N-Cysteinyl glycine***N-Cysteinyl-glycine***N-L-Cysteinyl-glycine***Cysteinyl-glycine,ZUKPVRWZDMRIEO-VKHMYHEASA-N,"InChI=1S/C5H10N2O3S/c6-3(2-11)5(10)7-1-4(8)9/h3,11H,1-2,6H2,(H,7,10)(H,8,9)/t3-/m0/s1"
ch4,74-82-8,16183,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Methane (CH4), is a gas produced by a group of colonic anaerobes, absorbed from the colon and excreted in expired air. As a result, breath CH4 excretion can be used as an indicator of the in situ activity of the methanogenic flora. All CH4 produced in human beings is a metabolic product of intestinal bacteria, and about 50% of CH4 produced in the gut is absorbed and excreted in expired air. Because there appears to be no catabolism of this gas by other colonic organisms or host cells, breath CH4 measurements provide a rapid, simple means of semi quantitatively assessing the ongoing in situ metabolism of the methanogenic flora. It could seem likely that the intracolonic activity of a variety of bacteria similarly might be assessed quantitatively via analysis of expired air. However, the application of this methodology has been confounded by the rapid catabolism of many volatile bacterial products by other bacteria or human tissue. A striking aspect of the studies of breath CH4 measurements is the enormous individual variations in the excretion of this gas. Virtually all children under 5 years of age and 66% of the adult population do not exhale appreciable quantities of CH4. The remaining 34% of the adult population has appreciable breath methane concentrations of up to 80 ppm (mean, 15.2 ppm; median, 11.8 ppm). On this basis the population can be divided into CH4 producers or nonproducers, although a more accurate term would be to define subjects as being low or high CH4 producers. The primary methanogen present in the human colon, Methanobrevibacter smithii, produces methane via a reaction that relies entirely on H2 produced by other organisms to reduce CO2 to CH4. Thus, breath CH4 concentrations might be expected to mirror breath H2 concentrations; however, the high levels of CH4 observed in the fasting state may result from H2 derived from endogenous rather than dietary substrates. A diverse assortment of conditions has been associated with a high prevalence of methane producers including diverticulosis, cystic fibrosis, high fasting serum cholesterol levels, encopresis in children, and aorto-iliac vascular disease, whereas obesity (measured as skin-fold thickness) was related inversely to methane production. The challenge that remains is to determine to what extent methanogens actively influence body physiology vs. simply serve as passive indicators of colonic function.

chloropha,,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Chlorophyll a is found in common wheat. Chlorophyll a is used in food processing as an appearance control agent for colours.Chlorophyll is a chlorin pigment, which is structurally similar to and produced through the same metabolic pathway as other porphyrin pigments such as heme. At the center of the chlorin ring is a magnesium ion. For the structures depicted in this article, some of the ligands attached to the Mg2+ center are omitted for clarity. The chlorin ring can have several different side chains, usually including a long phytol chain. There are a few different forms that occur naturally, but the most widely distributed form in terrestrial plants is chlorophyll a. The general structure of chlorophyll a was elucidated by Hans Fischer in 1940, and by 1960, when most of the stereochemistry of chlorophyll a was known, Robert Burns Woodward published a total synthesis of the molecule as then known. In 1967, the last remaining stereochemical elucidation was completed by Ian Fleming, and in 1990 Woodward and co-authors published an updated synthesis. Chlorophyll is a green pigment found in most plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. Its name is derived from the Greek (chloros ""green"") and (phyllon ""leaf""). Chlorophyll absorbs light most strongly in the blue and red but poorly in the green portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, hence the green colour of chlorophyll-containing tissues such as plant leaves. Chlorophyll itself is bound to proteins and can transfer the absorbed energy in the required direction. Protochlorophyllide, differently, mostly occur in the free form and under light conditions act as photosensitizer, forming highly toxic free radicals. Hence plants need an efficient mechanism of regulating the amount of chlorophyll precursor. In angiosperms, this is done at the step of aminolevulinic acid (ALA), one of the intermediate compounds in the biosynthesis pathway. Plants that are fed by ALA accumulate high and toxic levels of protochlorophyllide, so do the mutants with the damaged regulatory system. Chlorosis is a condition in which leaves produce insufficient chlorophyll, turning them yellow. Chlorosis can be caused by a nutrient deficiency including iron - called iron chlorosis, or in a shortage of magnesium or nitrogen. Soil pH sometimes play a role in nutrient-caused chlorosis, many plants are adapted to grow in soils with specific pHs and their ability to absorb nutrients from the soil can be dependent on the soil pH. Chlorosis can also be caused by pathogens including viruses, bacteria and fungal infections or sap sucking insects",Chlorophyll a,HMDB0038578,,,,,,,,,,

It is important as a precursor of acetylcholine, as a methyl donor in various metabolic processes, and in lipid metabolism. Choline is now considered to be an essential vitamin. While humans can synthesize small amounts (by converting phosphatidylethanolamine to phosphatidylcholine), it must be consumed in the diet to maintain health. Required levels are between 425 mg/day (female) and 550 mg/day (male). Milk, eggs, liver and peanuts are especially rich in choline. Most choline is found in phospholipids, namely phosphatidylcholine or lecithin. Choline can be oxidized to form betaine, which is a methyl source for many reactions (i.e. conversion of homocysteine e to methionine). Lack of sufficient amounts of choline in the diet can lead to a fatty liver condition and general liver damage. This arises from the lack of VLDL, which is necessary to transport fats away from the liver.

cholate,81-25-4,16359,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Cholic acid is a major primary bile acid produced in the liver and is usually conjugated with glycine or taurine. It facilitates fat absorption and cholesterol excretion. Bile acids are steroid acids found predominantly in the bile of mammals. The distinction between different bile acids is minute, and depends only on the presence or absence of hydroxyl groups on positions 3, 7, and 12. Bile acids are physiological detergents that facilitate excretion, absorption, and transport of fats and sterols in the intestine and liver. Bile acids are also steroidal amphipathic molecules derived from the catabolism of cholesterol. They modulate bile flow and lipid secretion, are essential for the absorption of dietary fats and vitamins, and have been implicated in the regulation of all the key enzymes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Bile acids recirculate through the liver, bile ducts, small intestine, and portal vein to form an enterohepatic circuit. They exist as anions at physiological pH, and consequently require a carrier for transport across the membranes of the enterohepatic tissues. The unique detergent properties of bile acids are essential for the digestion and intestinal absorption of hydrophobic nutrients. Bile acids have potent toxic properties (e.g. membrane disruption) and there are a plethora of mechanisms to limit their accumulation in blood and tissues (PMID: 11316487, 16037564, 12576301, 11907135). When present in sufficiently high levels, cholic acid can act as a hepatotoxin and a metabotoxin. A hepatotoxin causes damage to the liver or liver cells. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Among the primary bile acids, cholic acid is considered to be the least hepatotoxic while deoxycholic acid is the most hepatoxic (PMID: 1641875). The liver toxicity of bile acids appears to be due to their ability to peroxidate lipids and to lyse liver cells. Chronically high levels of cholic acid are associated with familial hypercholanemia. In hypercholanemia, bile acids, including cholic acid, are elevated in the blood. This disease causes liver damage, extensive itching, poor fat absorption, and can lead to rickets due to lack of calcium in bones. The deficiency of normal bile acids in the intestines results in a deficiency of vitamin K, which also adversely affects clotting of the blood.

cholcoaone,,27379,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): 3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-Trihydroxy-5beta-24-oxocholestanoyl-CoA is an intermediate in bile acid synthesis. Bile acids are steroid acids found predominantly in bile of mammals. The distinction between different bile acids is minute, depends only on presence or absence of hydroxyl groups on positions 3, 7, and 12. Bile acids are physiological detergents that facilitate excretion, absorption, and transport of fats and sterols in the intestine and liver. Bile acids are also steroidal amphipathic molecules derived from the catabolism of cholesterol. They modulate bile flow and lipid secretion, are essential for the absorption of dietary fats and vitamins, and have been implicated in the regulation of all the key enzymes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Bile acids recirculate through the liver, bile ducts, small intestine and portal vein to form an enterohepatic circuit. They exist as anions at physiological pH and, consequently, require a carrier for transport across the membranes of the enterohepatic tissues. The unique detergent properties of bile acids are essential for the digestion and intestinal absorption of hydrophobic nutrients. Bile acids have potent toxic properties (e.g., membrane disruption) and there are a plethora of mechanisms to limit their accumulation in blood and tissues.

chsterol,57-88-5,1307929,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Cholesterol is a sterol (a combination steroid and alcohol) and a lipid found in the cell membranes of all body tissues and transported in the blood plasma of all animals. The name originates from the Greek chole- (bile) and stereos (solid), and the chemical suffix -ol for an alcohol. This is because researchers first identified cholesterol in solid form in gallstones in 1784. In the body, cholesterol can exist in either the free form or as an ester with a single fatty acid (of 10-20 carbons in length) covalently attached to the hydroxyl group at position 3 of the cholesterol ring. Due to the mechanism of synthesis, plasma cholesterol esters tend to contain relatively high proportions of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Most of the cholesterol consumed as a dietary lipid exists as cholesterol esters. Cholesterol esters have a lower solubility in water than cholesterol and are more hydrophobic. They are hydrolyzed by the pancreatic enzyme cholesterol esterase to produce cholesterol and free fatty acids. Cholesterol has vital structural roles in membranes and in lipid metabolism in general. It is a biosynthetic precursor of bile acids, vitamin D, and steroid hormones (glucocorticoids, estrogens, progesterones, androgens and aldosterone). In addition, it contributes to the development and functioning of the central nervous system, and it has major functions in signal transduction and sperm development. Cholesterol is a ubiquitous component of all animal tissues where much of it is located in the membranes, although it is not evenly distributed. The highest proportion of unesterified cholesterol is in the plasma membrane (roughly 30-50% of the lipid in the membrane or 60-80% of the cholesterol in the cell), while mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum have very low cholesterol contents. Cholesterol is also enriched in early and recycling endosomes, but not in late endosomes. The brain contains more cholesterol than any other organ where it comprises roughly a quarter of the total free cholesterol in the human body. Of all the organic constituents of blood, only glucose is present in a higher molar concentration than cholesterol. Cholesterol esters appear to be the preferred form for transport in plasma and as a biologically inert storage (de-toxified) form. They do not contribute to membranes but are packed into intracellular lipid particles. Cholesterol molecules (i.e. cholesterol esters) are transported throughout the body via lipoprotein particles. The largest lipoproteins, which primarily transport fats from the intestinal mucosa to the liver, are called chylomicrons. They carry mostly triglyceride fats and cholesterol that are from food, especially internal cholesterol secreted by the liver into the bile. In the liver, chylomicron particles give up triglycerides and some cholesterol. They are then converted into low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, which carry triglycerides and cholesterol on to other body cells. In healthy individuals, the LDL particles are large and relatively few in number. In contrast, large numbers of small LDL particles are strongly associated with promoting atheromatous disease within the arteries. (Lack of information on LDL particle number and size is one of the major problems of conventional lipid tests.). In conditions with elevated concentrations of oxidized LDL particles, especially small LDL particles, cholesterol promotes atheroma plaque deposits in the walls of arteries, a condition known as atherosclerosis, which is a major contributor to coronary heart disease and other forms of cardiovascular disease. There is a worldwide trend to believe that lower total cholesterol levels tend to correlate with lower atherosclerosis event rates (though some studies refute this idea). As a result, cholesterol has become a very large focus for the scientific community trying to determine the proper amount of cholesterol needed in a healthy diet. However, the primary association of atherosclerosis with cholesterol has always been specifically with cholesterol transport patterns, not total cholesterol per se. For example, total cholesterol can be low, yet made up primarily of small LDL and small HDL particles and atheroma growth rates are high. In contrast, however, if LDL particle number is low (mostly large particles) and a large percentage of the HDL particles are large (HDL is actively reverse transporting cholesterol), then atheroma growth rates are usually low, even negative, for any given total cholesterol concentration. These effects are further complicated by the relative concentration of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) in the endothelium since ADMA down-regulates production of nitric oxide, a relaxant of the endothelium. Thus, high levels of ADMA, associated with highly oxidized levels of LDL, pose a heightened risk factor for vascular disease. Chronically high levels of cholesterol are associated with at least five inborn errors of metabolism, including cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, cholesteryl ester storage disease, congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia, hypercholesterolemia, and Zellweger syndrome. In chronically high levels, cholesterol can function as an atherogen (causes atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease). Specifically, chronically high levels (from diet or from genetic predisposition or from diseases such as hyperlipidemia) of cholesterol and cholesterol esters lead to an excess of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles. In healthy individuals, the LDL particles are large and relatively few in number. In contrast, large numbers of small LDL particles are strongly associated with promoting atheromatous disease within the arteries. In conditions with elevated concentrations of oxidized LDL particles, especially small LDL particles, cholesterol promotes atheroma plaque deposits in the walls of arteries, a condition known as atherosclerosis, which is a major contributor to coronary heart disease and other forms of cardiovascular disease. Resistin, a protein secreted by fat tissue, has been shown to increase the production of LDL in human liver cells and also degrades LDL receptors in the liver. As a result, the liver is less able to clear cholesterol from the bloodstream. Resistin accelerates the accumulation of LDL in arteries, increasing the risk of heart disease.",Cholesterol,HMDB0000067,,,C00187,CHOLESTEROL,FDB013269,chsterol,[H]O[C@]1([H])C([H])([H])C2=C([H])C([H])([H])[C@@]3([H])[C@]4([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])[C@]([H])([C@]([H])(C([H])([H])[H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])(C([H])([H])[H])C([H])([H])[H])[C@@]4(C([H])([H])[H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])[C@]3([H])[C@@]2(C([H])([H])[H])C([H])([H])C1([H])[H],"(3beta,14beta,17alpha)-Cholest-5-en-3-ol***Cholest-5-en-3beta-ol***Cholesterin***(3b,14b,17a)-Cholest-5-en-3-ol***(3β,14β,17α)-cholest-5-en-3-ol***Cholest-5-en-3b-ol***Cholest-5-en-3β-ol***(3β)-Cholest-5-en-3-ol***(3beta)-Cholest-5-en-3-ol***3β-Hydroxycholest-5-ene***3beta-Hydroxycholest-5-ene***5:6-Cholesten-3β-ol***5:6-Cholesten-3beta-ol***(-)-Cholesterol***Cholesterine***Cholesterol base H***Cholesteryl alcohol***Cholestrin***Cholestrol***Cordulan***Dastar***Dusoline***Dusoran***Dythol***Fancol CH***Hydrocerin***Kathro***Lanol***Super hartolan***Tegolan***Cholesterol",HVYWMOMLDIMFJA-DPAQBDIFSA-N,"InChI=1S/C27H46O/c1-18(2)7-6-8-19(3)23-11-12-24-22-10-9-20-17-21(28)13-15-26(20,4)25(22)14-16-27(23,24)5/h9,18-19,21-25,28H,6-8,10-17H2,1-5H3/t19-,21+,22+,23-,24+,25+,26+,27-/m1/s1"

cit,77-92-9,30769,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Citric acid (citrate) is a weak acid that is formed in the tricarboxylic acid cycle or that may be introduced with diet. The evaluation of plasma citric acid is scarcely used in the diagnosis of human diseases. On the contrary urinary citrate excretion is a common tool in the differential diagnosis of kidney stones, renal tubular acidosis and it plays also a role in bone diseases. The importance of hypocitraturia should be considered with regard to bone mass, urine crystallization and urolithiasis. (PMID 12957820) The secretory epithelial cells of the prostate gland of humans and other animals posses a unique citrate-related metabolic pathway regulated by testosterone and prolactin. This specialized hormone-regulated metabolic activity is responsible for the major prostate function of the production and secretion of extraordinarily high levels of citrate. The key regulatory enzymes directly associated with citrate production in the prostate cells are mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, and mitochondrial aconitase. testosterone and prolactin are involved in the regulation of the corresponding genes associated with these enzymes. The regulatory regions of these genes contain the necessary response elements that confer the ability of both hormones to control gene transcription. Protein kinase C (PKC) is the signaling pathway for the prolactin regulation of the metabolic genes in prostate cells. testosterone and prolactin regulation of these metabolic genes (which are constitutively expressed in all mammalian cells is specific for these citrate-producing cells (PMID 12198595). Citric acid is found in citrus fruits, most concentrated in lemons and limes, where it can comprise as much as 8% of the dry weight of the fruit. Citric acid is a natural preservative and is also used to add an acidic (sour) taste to foods and soft drinks. The salts of citric acid (citrates) can be used as anticoagulants due to their calcium chelating ability. Intolerance to citric acid in the diet is known to exist. Little information is available as the condition appears to be rare, but like other types of food intolerance it is often described as a ""pseudo-allergic"" reaction.

cl,16887-00-6,29311,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Under standard conditions, chlorine exists as a diatomic molecule. Chlorine is a highly toxic, pale yellow-green gas that has a specific strong smell. In nature, chlorine is most abundant as a chloride ion. Physiologically, it exists as an ion in the body. The chloride ion is an essential anion that the body needs for many critical functions. It also helps keep the body's acid-base balance. The amount of chloride in the blood is carefully controlled by the kidneys. Chloride ions have important physiological roles. For instance, in the central nervous system, the inhibitory action of glycine and some of the action of GABA relies on the entry of Cl- into specific neurons. Also, the chloride-bicarbonate exchanger biological transport protein relies on the chloride ion to increase the blood's capacity of carbon dioxide, in the form of the bicarbonate ion. Chloride-transporting proteins (CLC) play fundamental roles in many tissues in the plasma membrane as well as in intracellular membranes. CLC proteins form a gene family that comprises nine members in mammals, at least four of which are involved in human genetic diseases. GABA(A) receptors are pentameric complexes that function as ligand-gated chloride ion channels. WNK kinases are a family of serine-threonine kinases that have been shown to play an essential role in the regulation of electrolyte homeostasis, and they are found in diverse epithelia throughout the body that are involved in chloride ion flux. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by alterations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTCR) gene that result in deranged sodium and chloride ion transport channels.

clpnd,,53488,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Docosapentaenoic acid (also known as clupanodonic acid) is an essential omega-3 fatty acid (EFA) which is prevalent in fish oils. Docosapentaenoic acid, commonly called DPA, is an intermediary between eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5 &#969;-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6 &#969;-3). Seal oil is a rich source. There are three functions of docosapentaenoic acid. The most important is as part of phospholipids in all animal cellular membranes: a deficiency of docosapentaenoic acid leads to faulty membranes being formed. A second is in the transport and oxidation of cholesterol: clupanodonic acid tends to lower plasma cholesterol. A third function is as a precursor of prostanoids which are only formed from docosapentaenoic acid. Deficiency of this in experimental animals causes lesions mainly attributable to faulty cellular membranes: sudden failure of growth, lesions of skin and kidney and connective tissue, erythrocyte fragility, impaired fertility, uncoupling of oxidation and phosphorylation. In man pure deficiency of docosapentaenoic acid has been studied particularly in persons fed intravenously. A relative deficiency (that is, a low ratio in the body of docosapentaenoic to long-chain saturated fatty acids and isomers of docosapentaenoate) is common on Western diets and plays an important part in the causation of atherosclerosis, coronary thrombosis, multiple sclerosis, the triopathy of diabetes mellitus, hypertension and certain forms of malignant disease.

cmp,63-37-6,17361,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Cytidine monophosphate, also known as 5'-cytidylic acid and abbreviated CMP, is a nucleotide. It is an ester of phosphoric acid with the nucleoside cytidine. CMP consists of the phosphate group, the pentose sugar ribose, and the nucleobase cytosine. Cytidine monophosphate (CMP) is derived from cytidine triphosphate (CTP) with subsequent loss of two phosphates. The synthesis of the pyrimidines CTP and UTP occurs in the cytoplasm and starts with the formation of carbamoyl phosphate from glutamine and CO2. Next, aspartate undergoes a condensation reaction with carbamoyl-phosphate to form orotic acid. In a subsequent cyclization reaction, the enzyme Aspartate carbamoyltransferase forms N-carbamoyl-aspartate which is converted into dihydroorotic acid by Dihydroorotase. The latter is converted to orotate by Dihydroorotate oxidase. Orotate is covalently linked with a phosphorylated ribosyl unit with Orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (aka ""PRPP transferase"") catalyzing reaction, yielding orotidine monophosphate (OMP). Orotidine-5-phosphate is decarboxylated by Orotidine-5'-phosphate decarboxylase to form uridine monophosphate (UMP). UMP is phosphorylated by two kinases to uridine triphosphate (UTP) via two sequential reactions with ATP. CTP is subsequently formed by amination of UTP by the catalytic activity of CTP synthetase. Cytosine monophosphate (CMP) and uridine monophosphate (UMP) have been prescribed for the treatment of neuromuscular affections in humans. Patients treated with CMP/UMP recover from altered neurological functions. Additionally, the administration of CMP/UMP appears to favour the entry of glucose in the muscle and CMP/UMP may be important in maintaining the level of hepatic glycogen constant during exercise.

co,630-08-0,17245,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Carbon monoxide, with the chemical formula CO, is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas. It is the product of the incomplete combustion of carbon-containing compounds, notably in internal-combustion engines. It consists of one carbon atom covalently bonded to one oxygen atom. It is a gas at room temperature. Carbon monoxide is a significantly toxic gas and is the most common type of fatal poisoning in many countries. Exposures can lead to significant toxicity of the central nervous system and heart. Carbon monoxide has a higher diffusion coefficient compared to oxygen and the only enzyme in the human body that produces carbon monoxide is heme oxygenase which is located in all cells and breaks down heme. Because it has a higher diffusion coefficient than oxygen the body easily gets rid of any CO made. When CO is not ventilated it binds to hemoglobin, which is the principal oxygen-carrying compound in blood; this produces a compound known as carboxyhemoglobin. The traditional belief is that carbon monoxide toxicity arises from the formation of carboxyhemoglobin, which decreases the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood and inhibits the transport, delivery, and utilization of oxygen by the body. The affinity between hemoglobin and carbon monoxide is approximately 230 times stronger than the affinity between hemoglobin and oxygen so hemoglobin binds to carbon monoxide in preference to oxygen. Following poisoning, long-term sequelae often occur. Carbon monoxide can also have severe effects on the fetus of a pregnant woman. Despite its serious toxicity, CO is extremely useful and underpins much modern technology, being a precursor to a myriad of useful - even life-saving - products. Carbon monoxide, though thought of as a pollutant today, has always been present in the atmosphere, chiefly as a product of volcanic activity. It occurs dissolved in molten volcanic rock at high pressures in the earth's mantle. Carbon monoxide contents of volcanic gases vary from less than 0.01% to as much as 2% depending on the volcano. It also occurs naturally in bushfires. Because natural sources of carbon monoxide are so variable from year to year, it is extremely difficult to accurately measure natural emissions of the gas.

Carbon dioxide is produced during respiration by all animals, fungi and microorganisms that depend on living and decaying plants for food, either directly or indirectly. It is, therefore, a major component of the carbon cycle. Additionally, carbon dioxide is used by plants during photosynthesis to make sugars which may either be consumed again in respiration or used as the raw material to produce polysaccharides such as starch and cellulose, proteins and the wide variety of other organic compounds required for plant growth and development. When inhaled at concentrations much higher than usual atmospheric levels, it can produce a sour taste in the mouth and a stinging sensation in the nose and throat. These effects result from the gas dissolving in the mucous membranes and saliva, forming a weak solution of carbonic acid. Carbon dioxide is used by the food industry, the oil industry, and the chemical industry. Carbon dioxide is used to produce carbonated soft drinks and soda water.

coa,85-61-0,1146900,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Coenzyme A (CoA, CoASH, or HSCoA) is a coenzyme notable for its role in the synthesis and oxidization of fatty acids and the oxidation of pyruvate in the citric acid cycle. It is adapted from beta-mercaptoethylamine, panthothenate, and adenosine triphosphate. It is also a parent compound for other transformation products, including but not limited to, phenylglyoxylyl-CoA, tetracosanoyl-CoA, and 6-hydroxyhex-3-enoyl-CoA. Coenzyme A is synthesized in a five-step process from pantothenate and cysteine. In the first step pantothenate (vitamin B5) is phosphorylated to 4'-phosphopantothenate by the enzyme pantothenate kinase (PanK, CoaA, CoaX). In the second step, a cysteine is added to 4'-phosphopantothenate by the enzyme phosphopantothenoylcysteine synthetase (PPC-DC, CoaB) to form 4'-phospho-N-pantothenoylcysteine (PPC). In the third step, PPC is decarboxylated to 4'-phosphopantetheine by phosphopantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase (CoaC). In the fourth step, 4'-phosphopantetheine is adenylylated to form dephospho-CoA by the enzyme phosphopantetheine adenylyl transferase (CoaD). Finally, dephospho-CoA is phosphorylated using ATP to coenzyme A by the enzyme dephosphocoenzyme A kinase (CoaE). Since coenzyme A is, in chemical terms, a thiol, it can react with carboxylic acids to form thioesters, thus functioning as an acyl group carrier. CoA assists in transferring fatty acids from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria. A molecule of coenzyme A carrying an acetyl group is also referred to as acetyl-CoA. When it is not attached to an acyl group, it is usually referred to as 'CoASH' or 'HSCoA'. Coenzyme A is also the source of the phosphopantetheine group that is added as a prosthetic group to proteins such as acyl carrier proteins and formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase. Acetyl-CoA is an important molecule itself. It is the precursor to HMG CoA which is a vital component in cholesterol and ketone synthesis. Furthermore, it contributes an acetyl group to choline to produce acetylcholine in a reaction catalysed by choline acetyltransferase. Its main task is conveying the carbon atoms within the acetyl group to the citric acid cycle to be oxidized for energy production (Wikipedia).",Coenzyme A,HMDB0001423,,,C00010,CO-A,FDB022614,CoA,[H]O[C@@]([H])(C(=O)N([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C(=O)N([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])S[H])C(C([H])([H])[H])(C([H])([H])[H])C([H])([H])OP([O-])(=O)OP([O-])(=O)OC([H])([H])[C@@]1([H])O[C@@]([H])(N2C([H])=NC3=C(N=C([H])N=C23)N([H])[H])[C@]([H])(O[H])[C@]1([H])OP([O-])([O-])=O,"3'-Phosphoadenosine-(5')diphospho(4')pantatheine***[(2R,3S,4R,5R)-5-(6-amino-9H-Purin-9-yl)-4-hydroxy-3-(phosphonooxy)tetrahydrofuran-2-yl]methyl (3R)-3-hydroxy-4-({3-oxo-3-[(2-sulfanylethyl)amino]propyl}amino)-2,2-dimethyl-4-oxobutyl dihydrogen diphosphate***CoA***CoA-SH***CoASH***Coenzym a***HSCoA***Koenzym a***[(2R,3S,4R,5R)-5-(6-amino-9H-Purin-9-yl)-4-hydroxy-3-(phosphonooxy)tetrahydrofuran-2-yl]methyl (3R)-3-hydroxy-4-({3-oxo-3-[(2-sulfanylethyl)amino]propyl}amino)-2,2-dimethyl-4-oxobutyl dihydrogen diphosphoric acid***[(2R,3S,4R,5R)-5-(6-amino-9H-Purin-9-yl)-4-hydroxy-3-(phosphonooxy)tetrahydrofuran-2-yl]methyl (3R)-3-hydroxy-4-({3-oxo-3-[(2-sulphanylethyl)amino]propyl}amino)-2,2-dimethyl-4-oxobutyl dihydrogen diphosphate***[(2R,3S,4R,5R)-5-(6-amino-9H-Purin-9-yl)-4-hydroxy-3-(phosphonooxy)tetrahydrofuran-2-yl]methyl (3R)-3-hydroxy-4-({3-oxo-3-[(2-sulphanylethyl)amino]propyl}amino)-2,2-dimethyl-4-oxobutyl dihydrogen diphosphoric acid***a, Coenzyme***18-CoA-18-oxo-dinor-LTB4***Acetoacetyl coenzyme A sodium salt***CoA Hydrate***Coenzyme A Hydrate***Coenzyme A-SH***Coenzyme ASH***Coenzyme A***Depot-zeel***Propionyl CoA***Propionyl coenzyme A***S-Propanoate***S-Propanoate CoA***S-Propanoate coenzyme A***S-Propanoic acid***S-Propionate CoA***S-Propionate coenzyme A***Zeel",RGJOEKWQDUBAIZ-IBOSZNHHSA-J,"InChI=1S/C21H36N7O16P3S/c1-21(2,16(31)19(32)24-4-3-12(29)23-5-6-48)8-41-47(38,39)44-46(36,37)40-7-11-15(43-45(33,34)35)14(30)20(42-11)28-10-27-13-17(22)25-9-26-18(13)28/h9-11,14-16,20,30-31,48H,3-8H2,1-2H3,(H,23,29)(H,24,32)(H,36,37)(H,38,39)(H2,22,25,26)(H2,33,34,35)/p-4/t11-,14-,15-,16+,20-/m1/s1"

cobalt2,,48828,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Cobalt has a molecular weight of 58.9 and an atomic number of 27. In the Periodic Table, close to other transition metals, it is situated in group 8, together with rhodium and iridium and it can occur in four oxidation states (0, +2, +3 and +4). The +2 and the ground state are the most common. Cobalt occurs in the minerals cobaltite (Co, Fe) AsS, smaltite (CoAs2), and erythrite Co3(AsO4)2.8H2O, and is often associated with nickel, silver, lead, copper, and iron ores, from which it is most frequently obtained as a by-product. Depending on the considered species, cobalt has multiple industrial applications including the production of alloys and hard metal, diamond polishing, drying agents, pigments and catalysts. Hard metal or cemented carbide is a powder metallurgical product consisting of hard, wear-resistant carbide particles bound together (cemented) with a ductile metal binder (i.e. metallic Co) by liquid phase sintering. Tungsten carbide (WC) is produced by mixing tungsten powder with pure carbon powder at high temperature; hereafter WC is mixed with Co powder to which paraffin is added as a binder. Depending on specific requirements related to their use, hard metals might additionally contain small quantities of chromium, niobium, molybdenum, titanium, tantalum or vanadium carbides. Inhalation and skin contact are the main occupational exposure routes. Occupational exposure to cobalt may result in adverse health effects in different organs or tissues, including the respiratory tract, the skin, the hemapoietic tissues, the myocardium or the thyroid gland. In addition, teratogenic and carcinogenic effects have been observed in experimental systems and/or in humans. For the general population, the diet constitutes the main route of exposure to cobalt, since it is an essential component of Vitamin B12 (hydroxycolalamin). Cobalt functions as a co-factor in enzyme catalysed reactions and is involved in the production of erythropoietin, a hormone that stimulates the formation of erythrocytes. This last property of cobalt was applied in the past as a therapy for anaemia. The carcinogenic potential of cobalt and its compounds was evaluated in 1991 by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), which concluded that there was inadequate evidence for carcinogenicity in humans (lung cancer) but sufficient evidence in experimental animal studies. In most experimental studies considered, the routes of exposure were, however, of questionable relevance for cancer risk assessment in humans for example, local sarcomas after intra-muscular injection. The general conclusion was that cobalt and its compounds are possibly carcinogenic to humans (group 2B). Since this evaluation, additional data have been accumulated which generally indicate that, depending on the considered cobalt species, different outcomes regarding toxicity, mutagenicity and carcinogenicity can be observed. Physiologically, it exists as an ion in the body. Co(II) ions are genotoxic in vitro and in vivo, and carcinogenic in rodents. Co metal is genotoxic in vitro. Hard metal dust, of which occupational exposure is linked to an increased lung cancer risk, is proven to be genotoxic in vitro and in vivo. Possibly, production of active oxygen species and/or DNA repair inhibition are mechanisms involved. Given the recently provided proof for in vitro and in vivo genotoxic potential of hard metal dust, the mechanistic evidence of elevated production of active oxygen species and the epidemiological data on increased cancer risk, it may be advisable to consider the possibility of a new evaluation by IARC.(PMID: 14643417).",Cobalt,HMDB0000608,,,C00175,COBALT-FACTOR-III,FDB003581,,,co(II)***CO2+***co(2+)***COBALT (II) ion***Cobalt(2+) ion***Cobalt(II) cation***Cobaltous ion***Aquacat***Co***Cobalt-59***Cobatope-57***Kobalt***Super cobalt,,

coprost,360-68-9,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Coprosterol or coprostanol is a cholesterol derivative found in human feces, gallstones, eggs, and other biological matter. Coprosterol is the odorous principle of feces. It is formed from the biohydrogenation of cholesterol (cholest-5en-3&#946;-ol) in the gut of most higher animals and birds. This compound has frequently been used as a biomarker for the presence of human faecal matter in the environment. American physician Austin Flint named it stercorin (Wikipedia). The transformation of cholesterol into coprosterol in its passage through the body involves a reduction of the C5:C6 double bond, and a transition from the allocholanic- to the cholanic-ring system. Although it is established that the bacterial flora of the intestine is concerned in the reduction process, the mechanism by which the stereochemical change is brought about is unknown. Current data suggests that cholestenone and coprostanone, and not cholesterol itself, are the immediate precursors of coprosterol which is formed from them in the intestine by bacterial reduction.",Coprostanol,HMDB0000577,,,,,,coprost,,,QYIXCDOBOSTCEI-NWKZBHTNSA-N,

coumarin,91-64-5,28794,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Coumarin is a chemical compound/poison found in many plants, notably in high concentration in the tonka bean, woodruff, and bison grass. It has a sweet scent, readily recognised as the scent of newly-mown hay. It has clinical value as the precursor for several anticoagulants, notably warfarin. --Wikipedia. Coumarins, as a class, are comprised of numerous naturally occurring benzo-alpha-pyrone compounds with important and diverse physiological activities. The parent compound, coumarin, occurs naturally in many plants, natural spices, and foods such as tonka bean, cassia (bastard cinnamon or Chinese cinnamon), cinnamon, melilot (sweet clover), green tea, peppermint, celery, bilberry, lavender, honey (derived both from sweet clover and lavender), and carrots, as well as in beer, tobacco, wine, and other foodstuffs. Coumarin concentrations in these plants, spices, and foods range from <1 mg/kg in celery, 7000 mg/kg in cinnamon, and up to 87,000 mg/kg in cassia. An estimate of human exposure to coumarin from the diet has been calculated to be 0.02 mg/kg/day. Coumarin is used as an additive in perfumes and fragranced consumer products at concentrations ranging from <0.5% to 6.4% in fine fragrances to <0.01% in detergents. An estimate for systemic exposure of humans from the use of fragranced cosmetic products is 0.04 mg/kg BW/day, assuming complete dermal penetration. The use of coumarin as a food additive was banned by the FDA in 1954 based on reports of hepatotoxicity in rats. Due to its potential hepatotoxic effects in humans, the European Commission restricted coumarin from naturals as a direct food additive to 2 mg/kg food/day, with exceptions granting higher levels for alcoholic beverages, caramel, chewing gum, and certain 'traditional foods'. In addition to human exposure to coumarin from dietary sources and consumer products, coumarin is also used clinically as an antineoplastic and for the treatment of lymphedema and venous insufficiency. Exposure ranges from 11 mg/day for consumption of natural food ingredients to 7 g/day following clinical administration. Although adverse effects in humans following coumarin exposure are rare, and only associated with clinical doses, recent evidence indicates coumarin causes liver tumors in rats and mice and Clara cell toxicity and lung tumors in mice. The multiple effects as well as the ongoing human exposure to coumarin have resulted in a significant research effort focused on understanding the mechanism of coumarin induced toxicity/carcinogenicity and its human relevance. These investigations have revealed significant species differences in coumarin metabolism and toxicity such that the mechanism of coumarin induced effects in rodents, and the relevance of these findings for the safety assessment of coumarin exposure in humans are now better understood. In October 2004, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA, 2004) reviewed coumarin to establish a tolerable daily intake (TDI) in foods. EFSA issued an opinion indicating that coumarin is not genotoxic, and that a threshold approach to safety assessment was most appropriate. EFSA recommended a TDI of 0 to 0.1 mg/kg BW/day. Including dietary contributions, the total human exposure is estimated to be 0.06 mg/kg/day. As a pharmaceutical, coumarin has been used in diverse applications with a wide variety of dosing regimens. Unlike coumadin and other coumarin derivatives, coumarin has no anti-coagulant activity. However, at low doses (typically 7 to 10 mg/day), coumarin has been used as a 'venotonic' to promote vein health and small venule blood flow. Additionally, coumarin has been used clinically in the treatment of high-protein lymphedema of various etiologies.

Coproporphyrinogen I is a tetrapyrrole dead-end product resulting from the spontaneous oxidation of the methylene bridges of coproporphyrinogen arising from heme synthesis. It is secreted in feces and urine. Coproporphyrinogen I is biosynthesized from the tetrapyrrole hydroxymethylbilane, which is converted by the action of uroporphyrinogen synthase to uroporphyrinogen I. Uroporphyrinogen I is subsequently converted into coproporphyrinogen I through a series of four decarboxylations. Increased levels of coproporphyrinogens can indicate congenital erythropoietic porphyria or sideroblastic anemia, which are inherited disorders. Porphyria is a pathological state characterized by abnormalities of porphyrin metabolism and results in the excretion of large quantities of porphyrins in the urine and in extreme sensitivity to light. A large number of factors are capable of increasing porphyrin excretion, owing to different and multiple causes and etiologies: (1) the main site of the chronic hepatic porphyria disease process concentrates on the liver, (2) a functional and morphologic liver injury is almost regularly associated with this chronic porphyria, and (3) the toxic form due to occupational and environmental exposure takes mainly a subclinical course. Hepatic factors include disturbance in coproporphyrinogen metabolism, which results from inhibition of coproporphyrinogen oxidase as well as from the rapid loss and diminished utilization of coproporphyrinogen in the hepatocytes. This may also explain why coproporphyrin, its autoxidation product, predominates physiologically in the urine. Decreased biliary excretion of coproporphyrin leading to a compensatory urinary excretion. Therefore, the coproporphyrin ring isomer ratio becomes a sensitive index for impaired liver function, intrahepatic cholestasis, and disturbed activity of hepatic uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase. In itself, secondary coproporphyrinuria is not associated with porphyria symptoms of a hepatologic-gastroenterologic, neurologic, or dermatologic order, even though coproporphyrinuria can occur with such symptoms (PMID: 3327428). Under certain conditions, coproporphyrinogen I can act as a phototoxin, a neurotoxin, and a metabotoxin. A phototoxin leads to cell damage upon exposure to light. A neurotoxin causes damage to nerve cells and nerve tissues. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of porphyrins are associated with porphyrias such as porphyria variegate, acute intermittent porphyria, hereditary coproporphyria (HCP), congenital erythropoietic porphyria, and sideroblastic anemia. There are several types of porphyrias (most are inherited). Hepatic porphyrias are characterized by acute neurological attacks (seizures, psychosis, extreme back and abdominal pain, and an acute polyneuropathy), while the erythropoietic forms present with skin problems (usually a light-sensitive blistering rash and increased hair growth). The neurotoxicity of porphyrins may be due to their selective interactions with tubulin, which disrupt microtubule formation and cause neural malformations (PMID: 3441503).

crn,541-15-1,11060,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Carnitine is not an essential amino acid; it can be synthesized in the body. However, it is so important in providing energy to muscles including the heart-that some researchers are now recommending carnitine supplements in the diet, particularly for people who do not consume much red meat, the main food source for carnitine. Carnitine has been described as a vitamin, an amino acid, or a metabimin, i.e., an essential metabolite. Like the B vitamins, carnitine contains nitrogen and is very soluble in water, and to some researchers carnitine is a vitamin (Liebovitz 1984). It was found that an animal (yellow mealworm) could not grow without carnitine in its diet. However, as it turned out, almost all other animals, including humans, do make their own carnitine; thus, it is no longer considered a vitamin. Nevertheless, in certain circumstances-such as deficiencies of methionine, lysine or vitamin C or kidney dialysis--carnitine shortages develop. Under these conditions, carnitine must be absorbed from food, and for this reason it is sometimes referred to as a ""metabimin"" or a conditionally essential metabolite. Like the other amino acids used or manufactured by the body, carnitine is an amine. But like choline, which is sometimes considered to be a B vitamin, carnitine is also an alcohol (specifically, a trimethylated carboxy-alcohol). Thus, carnitine is an unusual amino acid and has different functions than most other amino acids, which are most usually employed by the body in the construction of protein. Carnitine is an essential factor in fatty acid metabolism in mammals. It's most important known metabolic function is to transport fat into the mitochondria of muscle cells, including those in the heart, for oxidation. This is how the heart gets most of its energy. In humans, about 25% of carnitine is synthesized in the liver, kidney and brain from the amino acids lysine and methionine. Most of the carnitine in the body comes from dietary sources such as red meat and dairy products. Inborn errors of carnitine metabolism can lead to brain deterioration like that of Reye's syndrome, gradually worsening muscle weakness, Duchenne-like muscular dystrophy and extreme muscle weakness with fat accumulation in muscles. Borurn et al. (1979) describe carnitine as an essential nutrient for pre-term babies, certain types (non-ketotic) of hypoglycemics, kidney dialysis patients, cirrhosis, and in kwashiorkor, type IV hyperlipidemia, heart muscle disease (cardiomyopathy), and propionic or organic aciduria (acid urine resulting from genetic disease such as propionic acidemia or other anomalies). In all these conditions and the inborn errors of carnitine metabolism, carnitine is essential to life and carnitine supplements are valuable. carnitine therapy may also be useful in a wide variety of clinical conditions. carnitine supplementation has improved some patients who have angina secondary to coronary artery disease. It may be worth a trial in any form of hyperlipidemia or muscle weakness. carnitine supplements may be useful in many forms of toxic or metabolic liver disease and in cases of heart muscle disease. Hearts undergoing severe arrhythmia quickly deplete their stores of carnitine. Athletes, particularly in Europe, have used carnitine supplements for improved endurance. carnitine may improve muscle building by improving fat utilization and may even be useful in treating obesity. carnitine joins a long list of nutrients which may be of value in treating pregnant women, hypothyroid individuals, and male infertility due to low motility of sperm. Even the Physician's Desk Reference gives indication for carnitine supplements as ""improving the tolerance of ischemic heart disease, myocardial insufficiencies, and type IV hyperlipoproteinemia. carnitine deficiency is noted in abnormal liver function, renal dialysis patients, and severe to moderate muscular weakness with associated anorexia.""

crtn,60-27-5,16737,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Creatinine or creatine anhydride, is a breakdown product of creatine phosphate in muscle. The loss of water molecule from creatine results in the formation of creatinine. Creatinine is transferred to the kidneys by blood plasma, whereupon it is eliminated from the body by glomerular filtration and partial tubular excretion. Creatinine is usually produced at a fairly constant rate by the body. Measuring serum creatinine is a simple test and it is the most commonly used indicator of renal function. Creatinine is found to be associated with maple syrup urine disease, phenylketonuria, primary hypomagnesemia, propionic acidemia, and tyrosinemia I, which are inborn errors of metabolism. A rise in blood creatinine levels is observed only with marked damage to functioning nephrons; therefore this test is not suitable for detecting early kidney disease. The typical reference range for women is considered about 45-90 umol/l, for men 60-110 umol/l. Creatine and creatinine are metabolized in the kidneys, muscle, liver and pancreas.

crtsl,50-23-7,17650,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Cortisol is a corticosteroid hormone produced by the adrenal cortex that is involved in the response to stress; the main glucocorticoid secreted by the adrenal cortex. Cortisol produced by the adrenal cortex increases blood pressure, blood sugar levels, may cause infertility in women, and suppresses the immune system. As an oral or injectable drug, cortisol is also known as hydrocortisone. It is used as an immunosuppressive drug, given by injection in the treatment of severe allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis and angioedema, in place of prednisolone in patients who need steroid treatment but cannot take oral medication, and peri-operatively in patients on long-term steroid treatment to prevent an Addisonian crisis. Hydrocortisone is used, either as an injection or topically, in the treatment of inflammation, allergy, collagen diseases, asthma, adrenocortical deficiency, shock, and some neoplastic conditions. Cortisol is synthesized from pregnenolone. The amount of cortisol present in the serum undergoes diurnal variation, with the highest levels present in the early morning, and lower levels in the evening, several hours after the onset of sleep.

cu2,,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Copper is an essential nutrient to all higher plants and animals. Physiologically, it exists as an ion in the body. In animals, it is found primarily in the bloodstream, as a cofactor in various enzymes, and in copper-based pigments. In the body, copper shifts between the cuprous (Cu1+) and cupric (Cu2+) forms, though the majority of the body's copper is in the Cu2+ form. The ability of copper to easily accept and donate electrons explains its important role in oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions and in scavenging free radicals. Copper is a critical functional component of a number of essential enzymes known as cuproenzymes. For instance, the copper-dependent enzyme, cytochrome c oxidase, plays a critical role in cellular energy production. By catalyzing the reduction of molecular oxygen (O2) to water (H2O), cytochrome c oxidase generates an electrical gradient used by the mitochondria to create the vital energy-storing molecule, ATP. Another cuproenzyme, lysyl oxidase, is required for the cross-linking of collagen and elastin, which are essential for the formation of strong and flexible connective tissue. Another cuproeznyme, Monoamine oxidase (MAO), plays a role in the metabolism of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine. MAO also functions in the degradation of the neurotransmitter serotonin, which is the basis for the use of MAO inhibitors as antidepressants. One of the most important cuproenzymes is Superoxide dismutase (SOD). SOD functions as an antioxidant by catalyzing the conversion of superoxide radicals (free radicals or ROS) to hydrogen peroxide, which can subsequently be reduced to water by other antioxidant enzymes. Two forms of SOD contain copper: 1) copper/zinc SOD is found within most cells of the body, including red blood cells, and 2) extracellular SOD is a copper-containing enzyme found at high levels in the lungs and low levels in blood plasma. In sufficient amounts, copper can be poisonous or even fatal to organisms. Copper is normally bound to cuproenzymes (such as SOD, MOA) and is thus only toxic when unsequestered and unmediated. It is believed that zinc and copper compete for absorption in the digestive tract so that a diet that is excessive in one of these minerals may result in a deficiency in the other. An imbalance of zinc and copper status might be involved in human hypertension. Furthermore, copper is found to be associated with hyperzincaemia and hypercalprotectinaemia and Wilson's disease, which are inborn errors of metabolism.",Cu2+,HMDB0000657,,,,,,,,,JPVYNHNXODAKFH-UHFFFAOYSA-N,InChI=1S/Cu/q+2

The cyanate ion possesses 1 unit of negative charge, borne mainly by the nitrogen atom. In organic compounds the cyanate group is a functional group. The cyanate ion is an ambident nucleophile in nucleophilic substitution because it can react to form an alkyl cyanate R-OCN (exception) or an alkyl isocyanate R-NCO (rule). Aryl cyanates (C6H5OCN) can be formed by a reaction of phenol with cyanogen chloride (ClCN) in the presence of a base. The cyanate ion is relatively non-toxic in comparison with cyanides. Use of this fact is made in cyanide decontamination processes where a permanganate oxidation converts toxic cyanide to safer cyanate. Cyanate can be decomposed by the enzyme cyanate lyase (or cyanase), which is found in bacteria and plants. In particular cyanate can be decomposed to carbamate (ammonia) and carbon dioxide.

cys_L,52-90-4,17561,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Cysteine is a naturally occurring, sulfur-containing amino acid that is found in most proteins, although only in small quantities. Cysteine is unique amongst the twenty natural amino acids as it contains a thiol group. Thiol groups can undergo oxidation/reduction (redox) reactions; when cysteine is oxidized it can form cystine, which is two cysteine residues joined by a disulfide bond. This reaction is reversible: as reduction of this disulphide bond regenerates two cysteine molecules. The disulphide bonds of cystine are crucial to defining the structures of many proteins. Cysteine is often involved in electron-transfer reactions, and help the enzyme catalyze its reaction. Cysteine is also part of the antioxidant glutathione. N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) is a form of cysteine where an acetyl group is attached to cysteine's nitrogen atom and is sold as a dietary supplement. Cysteine is named after cystine, which comes from the Greek word kustis meaning bladder - cystine was first isolated from kidney stones. As cysteine contains a sulphydryl group, it can undergo redox reactions. Oxidation of cysteine can produce a disulfide bond with another thiol, or further oxidation can produce sulphfinic or sulfonic acids. The cysteine thiol group is also a nucleophile and can undergo addition and substitution reactions. Thiol groups become much more reactive when they are ionized, and cysteine residues in proteins have pKa values close to neutrality, so are often in their reactive thiolate form in the cell. The thiol group also has a high affinity for heavy metals and proteins containing cysteine will bind metals such as mercury, lead and cadmium tightly. Due to this ability to undergo redox reactions, cysteine has antioxidant properties. Cysteine is an important source of sulfur in human metabolism, and although it is classified as a non-essential amino acid, cysteine may be essential for infants, the elderly, and individuals with certain metabolic disease or who suffer from malabsorption syndromes, Although, L-cysteine is found to be associated with sulfite oxidase deficiency, which is a genetic disorder. Cysteine may at some point be recognized as an essential or conditionally essential amino acid (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cysteine). Cysteine is important in energy metabolism. As cystine, it is a structural component of many tissues and hormones. Cysteine has clinical uses ranging from baldness to psoriasis to preventing smoker's hack. In some cases, oral cysteine therapy has proved excellent for treatment of asthmatics, enabling them to stop theophylline and other medications. Cysteine also enhances the effect of topically applied silver, tin and zinc salts in preventing dental cavities. In the future, cysteine may play a role in the treatment of cobalt toxicity, diabetes, psychosis, cancer and seizures (http://www.dcnutrition.com/AminoAcids/).",L-Cysteine,HMDB0000574,,,C00097,CYS,FDB012678,cys_L,[H]SC([H])([H])[C@@]([H])(C([O-])=O)[N+]([H])([H])[H],(2R)-2-amino-3-Mercaptopropanoic acid***(2R)-2-amino-3-Sulfanylpropanoic acid***(R)-2-amino-3-Mercaptopropanoic acid***C***Cys***CYSTEINE***e 920***e-920***e920***FREE cysteine***L-2-amino-3-Mercaptopropionic acid***L-Cystein***L-Zystein***(2R)-2-amino-3-Mercaptopropanoate***(2R)-2-amino-3-Sulfanylpropanoate***(2R)-2-amino-3-Sulphanylpropanoate***(2R)-2-amino-3-Sulphanylpropanoic acid***(R)-2-amino-3-Mercaptopropanoate***L-2-amino-3-Mercaptopropionate***(+)-2-amino-3-Mercaptopropionic acid***(R)-(+)-Cysteine***(R)-2-amino-3-mercapto-Propanoate***(R)-2-amino-3-mercapto-Propanoic acid***(R)-Cysteine***2-amino-3-Mercaptopropanoate***2-amino-3-Mercaptopropanoic acid***2-amino-3-Mercaptopropionate***2-amino-3-Mercaptopropionic acid***3-mercapto-L-Alanine***Acetylcysteine***alpha-amino-beta-Thiolpropionic acid***b-Mercaptoalanine***beta-Mercaptoalanine***Carbocysteine***Cisteina***Cisteinum***Cystein***Cysteinum***Half-cystine***L Cysteine***L-(+)-Cysteine***L-2-amino-3-Mercaptopropanoate***L-2-amino-3-Mercaptopropanoic acid***Polycysteine***Thioserine***Cysteine hydrochloride***Zinc cysteinate***Half cystine,XUJNEKJLAYXESH-REOHCLBHSA-N,"InChI=1S/C3H7NO2S/c4-2(1-7)3(5)6/h2,7H,1,4H2,(H,5,6)/t2-/m0/s1"

cysam,60-23-1,17141,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Cysteamine is a product of the constitutive degradation of coenzyme A, a process that occurs in all tissues, although some tissues such as brain and heart may have exceptionally high coenzyme A turnover rates. Cysteamine has only one known function, and that is as a precursor for the formation of hypotaurine, which is subsequently oxidized to taurine. The rate of cysteamine production as a result of coenzyme A breakdown is not well understood but it is clear that cysteamine levels are not as dramatically affected by dietary habits as are cysteine levels. Cysteamine is generated from hypotaurine by cysteamine dioxygenase (EC:1.13.11.19), an enzyme that was recently identified in mammals (PMID: 17581819). Cysteamine is the simplest stable aminothiol found in the body. It is used in the treatment of disorders of cystine excretion. Cysteamine cleaves the disulfide bond with cysteine to produce molecules that can escape the metabolic defect in cystinosis and cystinuria. Cyst(e)amine may also serve as an endogenous regulator of immune system activity as well as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of Huntington disease. Cysteamine is also used as a radiation-protective agent that oxidizes in air to form cystamine.

These variations probably reflect the species differences in cytidine deaminase, the enzyme that converts cytidine to uridine in the body. The transport of cytidine into the brain's extracellular fluid, and then into neurons and glia, are essential prerequisites for cytidine to be utilized in the brain. An efficient mechanism mediating the brain uptake of circulating cytidine has not yet been demonstrated. The biosynthesis of PC, the most abundant phosphatide in the brain, via the Kennedy pathway requires phosphocholine and cytidine triphosphate (CTP), a cytidine nucleotide involved in the rate-limiting step. The enzyme that converts CTP to endogenous CDP-choline (CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase) is unsaturated at physiological brain CTP levels. APOBEC is a family of enzymes that has been discovered with the ability to deaminate cytidines on RNA or DNA. The human apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like 3G protein (APOBEC3G, or hA3G), provides cells with an intracellular antiretroviral activity that is associated with the hypermutation of viral DNA through cytidine deamination. Indeed, hA3G belongs to a family of vertebrate proteins that contains one or two copies of a signature sequence motif unique to cytidine deaminases (CTDAs) (PMID: 16769123, 15780864, 16720547).",Cytidine,HMDB0000089,,,C00475,CYTIDINE,FDB021809,cytd,[H]OC([H])([H])[C@@]1([H])O[C@@]([H])(N2C([H])=C([H])C(=NC2=O)N([H])[H])[C@]([H])(O[H])[C@]1([H])O[H],"1-beta-D-Arabinofuranosylcytosine***4-amino-1-beta-D-Arabinofuranosyl-2(1H)-pyrimidinone***Cytosine arabinoside***Cytosine-1-beta-D-arabinofuranoside***Cytosine-beta-D-arabinofuranoside***1-b-D-Arabinofuranosylcytosine***1-β-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine***4-amino-1-b-D-Arabinofuranosyl-2(1H)-pyrimidinone***4-amino-1-β-D-arabinofuranosyl-2(1H)-pyrimidinone***Cytosine-1-b-D-arabinofuranoside***Cytosine-1-β-D-arabinofuranoside***Cytosine-b-D-arabinofuranoside***Cytosine-β-D-arabinofuranoside***(beta-D-Arabinofuranosyl)cytosine***1-Arabinofuranosylcytosine***1-beta -D-Arabinofaranosylcytosine***1-beta -D-Arabinofuranosyl-4-amino-2(1H)pyrimidinone***1-beta -D-Arabinofuranosylcytosine***1-beta-D-Arabinofaranosylcytosine***1-beta-D-Arabinofuranosyl-4-amino-2(1H)pyrimidinone***1-beta-D-Arabinofuranosyl-cytosine***1-beta-D-Arabinofuranosylcytosine, cytosine arabinoside***1-beta-D-Arabinosyl-cytosine***1-beta-D-Arabinosylcytosine***1beta -Arabinofuranasylcytosine***1beta -D-Arabinofuranosylcytosine***1beta -D-Arabinosylcytosine***1beta-Arabinofuranasylcytosine***1beta-D-Arabinofuranosylcytosine***1beta-D-Arabinosylcytosine***2(1H)-Pyrimidinone, 4-amino-1- -D-arabinofuranosyl***4-amino-1-Arabinofuranosyl-2-oxo-1,2-dihydropyrimidin***4-amino-1-Arabinofuranosyl-2-oxo-1,2-dihydropyrimidine***4-amino-1-b-D-Arabinofuranosyl-2-(1H)-pyrimidinone***4-amino-1-beta-D-Arabinofuranosylpyrimidin-2(1H)-one***Alexan***Ara-C***Arabinocytidine***Arabinofuranosylcytosine***Arabinosylcytosine***Arabitin***AraC***Aracytidine***Aracytin***Aracytine***Arafcyt***beta -Arabinosylcytosine***beta -Cytosine arabinoside***beta -D-Arabinosylcytosine***beta-Ara c***beta-Arabinosylcytosine***beta-Cytosine arabinoside***beta-D-Arabinosylcytosine***Cytarabin***Cytarabina***Cytarabine liposome injection***Cytarabinoside***Cytonal***Cytosar***Cytosar-u***Cytosine 1-beta-D-arabinofuranoside***Cytosine arabinofuranoside***Cytosine arabinose***Cytosine beta-D-arabinofuranoside***Cytosine beta-D-arabinoside***Cytosine, beta -D-arabinoside***Cytosine, beta-D-arabinoside***Cytosine-1-beta-D-arabinofuranoside hydrochloride***Cytosine-beta -arabinoside***Cytosine-beta -D-arabinofuranoside***Cytosine-beta-arabinoside***Cytosinearabinoside***Depocyt***Depocyte***Erpalfa***Iretin***Spongocytidine***Tarabine***Udicil***Arabinoside, cytosine***CytosarU***Hydrochloride, cytarabine***Cytarabine hydrochloride***Cytosar u",UHDGCWIWMRVCDJ-XVFCMESISA-N,"InChI=1S/C9H13N3O5/c10-5-1-2-12(9(16)11-5)8-7(15)6(14)4(3-13)17-8/h1-2,4,6-8,13-15H,3H2,(H2,10,11,16)/t4-,6-,7-,8-/m1/s1"

dak2gpe_hs,,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): 2-Hexadecanoyl-1-(1Z-hexadecenyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine is an intermediate of ether lipid metabolism. Ether lipids are lipids in which one or more of the carbon atoms on glycerol is bonded to an alkyl chain via an ether linkage, as opposed to the usual ester linkage. In the ether lipid metabolism pathway, 2-hexadecanoyl-1-(1Z-hexadecenyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine is involved in two enzymatic reactions: 1. It irreversibly produces 1-(1Z-hexadecenyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine via the enzyme phospholipase A2 (EC:3.1.1.4) and 2. it irreversibly produces 2-hexadecanoyl-1-(1Z-hexadecenyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphate via the enzyme phospholipase D (EC:3.1.4.4). While most phospholipids have a saturated fatty acid on C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid on C-2 of the glycerol backbone, the fatty acid distribution at the C-1 and C-2 positions of glycerol within phospholipids is continually in flux, owing to phospholipid degradation and the continuous phospholipid remodeling that occurs while these molecules are in membranes. PEs are neutral zwitterions at physiological pH. They mostly have palmitic or stearic acid on carbon 1 and a long chain unsaturated fatty acid (e.g. 18:2, 20:4 and 22:6) on carbon 2. PE synthesis can occur via two pathways. The first requires that ethanolamine be activated by phosphorylation and then coupled to CDP. The ethanolamine is then transferred from CDP-ethanolamine to phosphatidic acid to yield PE. The second involves the decarboxylation of PS. Plasmalogens are glycerol ether phospholipids. They are of two types, alkyl ether (-O-CH2-) and alkenyl ether (-O-CH=CH-). Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) serves as the glycerol precursor for the synthesis of plasmalogens. Three major classes of plasmalogens have been identified: choline, ethanolamine and serine derivatives. Ethanolamine plasmalogen is prevalent in myelin. Choline plasmalogen is abundant in cardiac tissue. Usually, the highest proportion of the plasmalogen form is in the ethanolamine class with rather less in choline, and commonly little or none in other phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol. In choline plasmalogens of most tissues, a higher proportion is often of the O-alkyl rather than the O-alkenyl form, but the reverse tends to be true in heart lipids. In animal tissues, the alkyl and alkenyl moieties in both non-polar and phospholipids tend to be rather simple in composition with 16:0, 18:0 and 18:1 (double bond in position 9) predominating. Ether analogues of triacylglycerols, i.e. 1-alkyldiacyl-sn-glycerols, are present at trace levels only if at all in most animal tissues, but they can be major components of some marine lipids.",PE(P-16:0e/16:0),HMDB0011158,,,C04756,,FDB027933,,[H]OP(=O)(OC([H])([H])C([H])([H])N([H])[H])OC([H])([H])C([H])(OC([*])=O)C([H])([H])O\C([H])=C(\[H])[*],1-(Hexadec-1-enyl)-2-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine zwitterion***1-[(1Z)-Hexadec-1-enyl]-2-hexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine zwitterion***1-[(1Z)-Hexadec-1-enyl]-2-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine zwitterion***PE(P-16:0/16:0)***2-Hexadecanoyl-1-(1Z-hexadecenyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine,FDULCEKAOVWBTQ-PXOIRPRXSA-N,

dchac,83-44-3,28834,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Deoxycholic acid is a secondary bile acid produced in the liver and is usually conjugated with glycine or taurine. It facilitates fat absorption and cholesterol excretion. Bile acids are steroid acids found predominantly in the bile of mammals. The distinction between different bile acids is minute, and depends only on the presence or absence of hydroxyl groups on positions 3, 7, and 12. Bile acids are physiological detergents that facilitate excretion, absorption, and transport of fats and sterols in the intestine and liver. Bile acids are also steroidal amphipathic molecules derived from the catabolism of cholesterol. They modulate bile flow and lipid secretion, are essential for the absorption of dietary fats and vitamins, and have been implicated in the regulation of all the key enzymes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Bile acids recirculate through the liver, bile ducts, small intestine, and portal vein to form an enterohepatic circuit. They exist as anions at physiological pH, and consequently require a carrier for transport across the membranes of the enterohepatic tissues. The unique detergent properties of bile acids are essential for the digestion and intestinal absorption of hydrophobic nutrients. Bile acids have potent toxic properties (e.g. membrane disruption) and there are a plethora of mechanisms to limit their accumulation in blood and tissues (PMID: 11316487, 16037564, 12576301, 11907135). When present in sufficiently high levels, deoxycholic acid can act as a hepatotoxin, a metabotoxin, and an oncometabolite. A hepatotoxin causes damage to the liver or liver cells. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. An oncometabolite is a compound, when present at chronically high levels, that promotes tumour growth and survival. Among the primary bile acids, cholic acid is considered to be the least hepatotoxic while deoxycholic acid is the most hepatoxic (PMID: 1641875). The liver toxicity of bile acids appears to be due to their ability to peroxidate lipids and to lyse liver cells. High bile acid levels lead to the generation of reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species, disruption of the cell membrane and mitochondria, induction of DNA damage, mutation and apoptosis, and the development of reduced apoptosis capability upon chronic exposure (PMID: 24884764). Chronically high levels of deoxycholic acid are associated with familial hypercholanemia. In hypercholanemia, bile acids, including deoxycholic acid, are elevated in the blood. This disease causes liver damage, extensive itching, poor fat absorption, and can lead to rickets due to lack of calcium in bones. The deficiency of normal bile acids in the intestines results in a deficiency of vitamin K, which also adversely affects clotting of the blood. The bile acid ursodiol (ursodeoxycholic acid) can improve symptoms associated with familial hypercholanemia. Chronically high levels of deoxycholic acid are also associated with several forms of cancer including colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, esophageal cancer, and many other GI cancers.",Deoxycholic acid,HMDB0000626,,,C04483,,FDB012780,dchac,[H]O[C@]1([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])[C@@]2(C([H])([H])[H])[C@]([H])(C([H])([H])C([H])([H])[C@@]3([H])[C@]4([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])[C@]([H])([C@]([H])(C([H])([H])[H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([O-])=O)[C@@]4(C([H])([H])[H])[C@@]([H])(O[H])C([H])([H])[C@]23[H])C1([H])[H],"(3ALPHA,5ALPHA,12ALPHA)-3,12-DIHYDROXYCHOLAN-24-OIC ACID***(3alpha,5beta,12alpha)-3,12-Dihydroxycholan-24-Oic acid***3alpha,12alpha-Dihydroxy-5beta-cholanic acid***7alpha-Deoxycholic acid***Desoxycholic acid***Desoxycholsaeure***(3a,5a,12a)-3,12-DIHYDROXYCHOLAN-24-Oate***(3a,5a,12a)-3,12-DIHYDROXYCHOLAN-24-Oic acid***(3alpha,5alpha,12alpha)-3,12-DIHYDROXYCHOLAN-24-Oate***(3α,5α,12α)-3,12-dihydroxycholan-24-Oate***(3α,5α,12α)-3,12-dihydroxycholan-24-Oic acid***Deoxycholate***(3a,5b,12a)-3,12-Dihydroxycholan-24-Oate***(3a,5b,12a)-3,12-Dihydroxycholan-24-Oic acid***(3alpha,5beta,12alpha)-3,12-Dihydroxycholan-24-Oate***(3α,5β,12α)-3,12-dihydroxycholan-24-Oate***(3α,5β,12α)-3,12-dihydroxycholan-24-Oic acid***3a,12a-Dihydroxy-5b-cholanate***3a,12a-Dihydroxy-5b-cholanic acid***3alpha,12alpha-Dihydroxy-5beta-cholanate***3α,12α-dihydroxy-5β-cholanate***3α,12α-dihydroxy-5β-cholanic acid***7a-Deoxycholate***7a-Deoxycholic acid***7alpha-Deoxycholate***7α-deoxycholate***7α-deoxycholic acid***Desoxycholate***5b-Cholanic acid-3a,12a-diol***5b-Deoxycholate***5b-Deoxycholic acid***7-Deoxycholate***7-Deoxycholic acid***Cholerebic***Cholorebic***Degalol***Deoxy-cholate***Deoxy-cholic acid***Deoxycholatate***Deoxycholatic acid***Acid, lagodeoxycholic***Deoxycholic acid, 5alpha isomer***Deoxycholic acid, sodium salt, 12beta-isomer***Lagodeoxycholic acid***Acid, choleic***Deoxycholic acid, 12beta isomer***Deoxycholic acid, 3beta-isomer***Deoxycholic acid, monoammonium salt***12beta-Isomer deoxycholic acid***3beta-Isomer deoxycholic acid***Acid, 5alpha-isomer deoxycholic***Acid, deoxycholic***Acid, desoxycholic***Deoxycholate, sodium***Deoxycholic acid, 12beta-isomer***Deoxycholic acid, 5alpha-isomer***Deoxycholic acid, monopotassium salt***Deoxycholic acid, monosodium salt***5alpha-Isomer deoxycholic acid***Acid, dihydroxycholanoic***Choleic acid***Deoxycholic acid, 3beta isomer***Deoxycholic acid, disodium salt***Deoxycholic acid, magnesium (2:1) salt***Dihydroxycholanoic acid***Sodium deoxycholate",KXGVEGMKQFWNSR-LLQZFEROSA-M,"InChI=1S/C24H40O4/c1-14(4-9-22(27)28)18-7-8-19-17-6-5-15-12-16(25)10-11-23(15,2)20(17)13-21(26)24(18,19)3/h14-21,25-26H,4-13H2,1-3H3,(H,27,28)/p-1/t14-,15-,16-,17+,18-,19+,20+,21+,23+,24-/m1/s1"

In humans, bile acids conjugated with glycine and taurine are the major solutes in bile, and unconjugated bile acids are almost nondetectable in normal bile. Conjugated bile acids are less toxic and are more efficient promoters of intestinal absorption of dietary lipid than unconjugated bile acids. The synthesis of bile acid and amino acid conjugates in human liver is the result of two independent enzymatic reactions with a bile acid coenzyme A thioester intermediate formation of bile acid-CoA esters, considered the rate-limiting step in bile acid amidation and catalyzed by an ATP-dependent microsomal enzyme, bile acid-CoA synthetase (EC 6.2.1.7). In the second reaction, the thioester bond is cleaved, and an amide bond is formed between the bile acid and the amino acids glycine or taurine. The bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.65) catalyzes this reaction in the cytosol prior to secretion into bile. In human liver the formation of bile acid-CoA thioesters is localized both to the microsomal fraction catalysed by an ATP-dependent synthetase and to the peroxisomal fraction catalysed by the thiolase in the last step of the beta-oxidative cleavage of the 5beta-cholestanoyl side chain. The highest specific amidation activity of both chenodeoxycholoyl-CoA is always found in the most peroxisome-rich subcellular fractions.

Cholesterol is synthesized from either Lathosterol, 7-Dehydrocholesterol, Desmosterol or Cholestenol by the enzyme 3beta-hydroxysterol delta7 reductase (EC 1.3.1.21, Dhcr7). The Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS, OMIM 270400) is caused by a genetic defect in cholesterol biosynthesis; mutations in the enzyme 3beta-hydroxysterol delta7 reductase lead to a failure of cholesterol synthesis, with an accumulation of precursor sterols, such as 7-Dehydrodesmosterol. SLOS results in craniofacial, limb as well as major organ defects, including the brain. In individuals with this syndrome, mental retardation, as well as other CNS dysfunction, is almost 100% prevalent.

debrisoquine,1131-64-2,34665,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Debrisoquine is an adrenergic neuron-blocking drug. Genetic and environmental factors are determinants of the interindividual and interethnic variability in drug metabolism. Thus, interethnic differences in debrisoquine hydroxylation polymorphism (Cytochrome p450, subfamily IID, polypeptide 6, CYP2D6) might be partly responsible for the variation in haloperidol disposition between races. The influence of tobacco, ethanol, caffeine, gender, and oral contraceptive use on the debrisoquine metabolic ratio (MR) has been analyzed in panels of healthy volunteers. About 5-10% of European white population has a genetically determinant defect of the CYP2D6, one of the enzymes of cytochrome P-450. This defect leads to the impaired metabolism of many drugs including various psychopharmacological agents. The measurement of the hydroxylation of debrisoquine is a laboratory test which allows identifying such an individual. Patients who show an impaired hydroxylation of debrisoquine usually demonstrate severe side effects and poor outcome of psychopharmacotherapy. In practice, knowledge of a patient's debrisoquine metabolic phenotype is an advantage when prescribing tricyclic antidepressants and neuroleptics, as the drug concentration will be considerably higher in slow metabolisers than in the average patient.

dextrin,,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Dextrins are a group of low-molecular-weight carbohydrates produced by the hydrolysis of starch. Dextrins are mixtures of linear &#945;-(1,4)-linked D-glucose polymers starting with an &#945;-(1,6) bond. Because branched amylopectin and glycogen also contain &#945;-(1,6) bonds, which &#945;-amylase cannot hydrolyze in humans, the digest resulting from this action contains a mixture of dextrins. They have the same general formula as carbohydrates but are of shorter chain length. Industrial production is, in general, performed by acidic hydrolysis of potato starch. Dextrins are water-soluble, white to slightly yellow solids that are optically active. Under analysis, dextrins can be detected with iodine solution, giving a red coloration. The cyclical dextrins are known as cyclodextrins. They are formed by enzymatic degradation of starch by certain bacteria, for example, Bacillus macerans. Cyclodextrins have toroidal structures formed by 6-8 glucose residues. Dextrins find widespread use in industry, due to their non-toxicity and their low price. They are used as water-soluble glues, as thickening agents in food processing, and as binding agent in pharmaceuticals. In pyrotechnics, they are added to fire formulas, allowing them to solidify as pellets or ""stars."" Cyclodextrins find additional use in analytical chemistry as a matrix for the separation of hydrophobic substances, and as excipients in pharmaceutical formulations. Not all forms of dextrin are digestible, and indigestible dextrin is sometimes used in fiber supplements. For example, maltodextrin either can be moderately sweet or have hardly any flavor at all. Maltodextrin is a polysaccharide that is used as a food additive. It is produced from starch and is usually found as a creamy-white hygroscopic powder. Maltodextrin is easily digestible, being absorbed as rapidly as glucose. The CAS registry number of maltodextrin is 9050-36-6. Maltodextrin can be derived from any starch. In the US, this starch is usually rice, corn or potato; elsewhere, such as in Europe, it is commonly wheat. This is important for coeliacs, since the wheat-derived maltodextrin can contain traces of gluten. There have been recent reports of coeliac reaction to maltodextrin in the United States. This might be a consequence of the shift of corn to ethanol production and its replacement with wheat in the formulation. The fast food chain, Wendy's, footnotes maltodextrin in its list of gluten-free foods [1], which may be a sign of their receiving reports of this. Foods containing maltodextrin may contain traces of amino acids, including glutamic acid as a manufacturing by-product. The amino acid traces would be too small to have any dietary significance.(Wikipedia).",Dextrin,HMDB0006857,,,C00721,,,,,,,

In the blood, most DHEA is found as DHEAS with levels that are about 300 times higher than those of free DHEA. Orally-ingested DHEA is converted to its sulfate when passing through intestines and liver. Whereas DHEA levels naturally reach their peak in the early morning hours, DHEAS levels show no diurnal variation. From a practical point of view, measurement of DHEAS is preferable to DHEA, as levels are more stable. DHEA (from which DHEAS comes from) is a natural steroid prohormone produced from cholesterol by the adrenal glands, the gonads, adipose tissue, brain and in the skin (by an autocrine mechanism). DHEA is the precursor of androstenedione, which can undergo further conversion to produce the androgen testosterone and the estrogens estrone and estradiol. DHEA is also a potent sigma-1 agonist.

Malaria parasites synthesize their folate cofactors de novo and that the antimalarial action of sulfonamides is due to their inhibiting the plasmodial dihydropteroate synthesis. The enzymes 6-hydroxymethylpterin pyrophosphokinase (EC 2.7.6.3, HPPK) and dihydropteroate synthase (EC 2.5.1.15, DHPS) catalyze sequential steps in folate biosynthesis. They are present in microorganisms but absent in mammals and therefore are especially suitable targets for antimicrobials. Sulfa drugs (sulfonamides and sulfones) currently are used as antimicrobials targeting DHPS, although resistance to these drugs is increasing. A NADPH-coupled microplate photometric assay could be used for rapid screening of chemical libraries for novel inhibitors of folate biosynthesis as the first step in developing new antimicrobial drugs targeting the folate biosynthetic pathway; in the microplate the product of the DHPS reaction, 7,8-Dihydropteroic acid, is reduced to tetrahydropteroate by excess dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) using the cofactor NADPH.

It is a vital component of cellular membranes of most eukaryotic organisms and some bacteria. Its abundance relative to other lipids is usually low other than in epithelial and neuronal cells. Galabiosylceramide is one of the lipids that accumulate in excessive amounts in Fabry's disease. Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked inborn error of glycosphingolipid (GSL) metabolism, caused by a deficiency of the lysosomal alpha-galactosidase A, which results in high levels in lysosomes and biological fluids of galabiosylceramide, also known as digalactosylceramide (Ga2). In Fabry disease, accumulation of galabiosylceramide is observed by coloration methods associated to optic or electron microscopy or more recently, with imaging mass spectrometry. Galabiosylceramide is the precursor of a series of oligoglycosylceramides. In animal tissues, biosynthesis involves addition of a second monosaccharide unit from the appropriate sugar nucleotide to a monoglycosylceramide, catalysed by a glycosyl transferase, in the lumen of the Golgi apparatus.

The hydrolytic deamination of dAMP residues in DNA yields dIMP residues. The deamination of adenine residues in DNA generates hypoxanthine, which is mutagenic since it can pair not only with thymine but also with cytosine and therefore would result in A-T to G-C transitions after DNA replication.

Normally, the cellular dITP concentration is very low. The inability to demonstrate the synthesis of dITP in cellular preparations has been attributed to the presence in the cytoplasm of an inosine triphosphatase pyrophosphatase (ITPase, EC 3.6.1.19), an enzyme that does not permit accumulation of these nucleotides. dITP can be incorporated into DNA by polymerases. The deoxyribonucleotide dITP behaves as a dGTP analogue and is incorporated opposite cytosine with about 50% efficiency. Both isolated nuclei and purified DNA polymerases rapidly incorporated dITP into DNA. In the presence of ATP, dITP is stabilized in extracts of nuclei. dITP exist in all cells and is potentially mutagenic, and the levels of these nucleotides are controlled by ITPase. The function of this ubiquitous protein family is proposed to be the elimination of minor potentially mutagenic or clastogenic purine nucleoside triphosphates from the cell.

dmantipyrine,89-25-8,31530,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Demethylated antipyrine is a novel potent free radical scavenger that has been clinically used to reduce the neuronal damage following ischemic stroke. Demethylated antipyrine exerts neuroprotective effects by inhibiting endothelial injury and by ameliorating neuronal damage in brain ischemia. Demethylated antipyrine provides the desirable features of NOS: it increases eNOS (beneficial NOS for rescuing ischemic stroke) and decreases nNOS and iNOS (detrimental NOS). Post- reperfusion brain edema and hemorrhagic events induced by thrombolytic therapy may be reduced by demethylated antipyrine pretreatment. Increased productions of superoxide and NO in the brain after reperfusion and a concomitant surge in oxygen free radicals with increased NO during recirculation lead to formation of peroxynitrite, a super potent radical. Demethylated antipyrine, which inhibits oxidation and enhances NO production derived from increased eNOS expression, may improve and conserve cerebral blood flow without peroxynitrite generation during reperfusion. Clinical experience with demethylated antipyrine suggests that this drug has a wide therapeutic time window. Demethylated antipyrine can exert a wide range of inhibitory effects on water-soluble and lipid soluble peroxyl radical-induced peroxidation systems, and appears to display combined properties of both, vitamin C and E. Demethylated antipyrine can scavenge not only hydroxyl radicals but also other free radicals, although it has no major effect on superoxide anion radicals. Demethylated antipyrine apparently traps hydroxyl radicals and inhibits OH-dependent lipid peroxidation or tyrosine nitration induced by peroxynitrite (ONOO-). Lipid peroxidation starts with lipid radical (L) production after free radical-mediated extraction of proton from unsaturated fatty acid. Subsequently lipid peroxyl radical (LOO) is generated by addition of oxygen atom, and a further L is produced by LOO-mediated extraction of proton from another unsaturated fatty acid. Demethylated antipyrine can inhibit lipid peroxidation by scavenging not only hydroxyl radicals but also other free radicals including LOO. Under physiological conditions, 50% of demethylated antipyrine is present as an anion form, and electrons released from demethylated antipyrine anion exert radical scavenging.

Numerous disorders have been described that lead to disturbances in energy production and in intermediary metabolism in the organism which are characterized by the production and excretion of unusual acylcarnitines. A mutation in the gene coding for carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase or the OCTN2 transporter aetiologically causes a carnitine deficiency that results in poor intestinal absorption of dietary L-carnitine, its impaired reabsorption by the kidney and, consequently, in increased urinary loss of L-carnitine. Determination of the qualitative pattern of acylcarnitines can be of diagnostic and therapeutic importance. The betaine structure of carnitine requires special analytical procedures for recording. The ionic nature of L-carnitine causes a high water solubility which decreases with increasing chain length of the ester group in the acylcarnitines. Therefore, the distribution of L-carnitine and acylcarnitines in various organs is defined by their function and their physico-chemical properties as well. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) permits screening for free and total carnitine, as well as complete quantitative acylcarnitine determination, including the long-chain acylcarnitine profile.

Vitamin K forms comprise a single major plant form, phylloquinone with a phytyl side chain and a family of bacterially synthesized menaquinones (MKs) with multiprenyl side chains. Bacterially produced menaquinones are biologically active forms of vitamin K that are present in high concentrations in the human lower bowel. Both phylloquinone and menaquinones are bioactive in hepatic gamma-carboxylation but long-chain MKs are less well absorbed. Liver stores of vitamin K are relatively small. The hepatic reserves of phylloquinone (approximately 10% of the total) are labile and turn over at a faster rate than menaquinones. Vitamin K is recognised as a factor required for normal blood coagulation, and in relation to its role in bone metabolism. Vitamin K is a substrate for a liver microsomal enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of specific glutamyl residues to gamma-carboxyglutamyl residues in a limited number of proteins. These include the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors: prothrombin (factor II), factor VII, factor IX, and factor X. In the absence of vitamin K, nonfunctional clotting factors are synthesized and hemorrhage can result. Vitamin K is a coenzyme for glutamate carboxylase, which mediates the conversion of glutamate to gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla). There are at least three Gla proteins associated with bone tissue, of which osteocalcin is the most abundant and best known. Trabecular and cortical bone appear to contain substantial concentrations of both phylloquinone and menaquinones.

This colorless liquid is an important ""dipolar aprotic solvent."" It is readily miscible in a wide range of organic solvents as well as water. It has a distinctive property of penetrating the skin very readily, allowing the handler to taste it. Some describe it as an ""oyster-like"" taste, others claim it tastes like garlic. DMSO is also employed as a rinsing agent in the electronics industry and, in its deuterated form (DMSO-d6), is a useful solvent in NMR due to its ability to dissolve a wide range of chemical compounds and its minimal interference with the sample signals. In cryobiology DMSO has been used as a cryoprotectant and is still an important constituent of cryoprotectant vitrification mixtures used to preserve organs, tissues, and cell suspensions. It is particularly important in the freezing and long-term storage of embryonic stem cells and hematopoietic stem cell, which are often frozen in a mixture of 10% DMSO and 90% fetal calf serum. As part of an autologous bone marrow transplant the DMSO is re-infused along with the patient's own hematopoietic stem cell. Dimethyl sulfoxide is a by-product of wood pulping.

doco13ac,112-86-7,28792,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Erucic acid is a monounsaturated omega-9 fatty acid found mainly in the Brassica family of plants such as canola, rapeseed, wallflower seed, mustard seed as well as Brussels spouts and broccoli. Some Brassica cultivars can have up to 40 to 50 percent of their oil recovered as erucic acid. Erucic acid is also known as cis-13-docosenoic acid. The trans isomer is known as brassidic acid. Erucic acid occurs in nature only along with bitter-tasting compounds. Erucic acid has many of the same uses as mineral oils but with the advantage that it is more readily bio-degradable. Its high tolerance to temperature makes it suitable for transmission oil. Its ability to polymerize and dry means it can be - and is - used as a binder for oil paints. Increased levels of eicosenoic acid (20:ln9) and erucic acid (22:1n9) have been found in the red blood cell membranes of autistic subjects with developmental regression (PMID: 16581239). Erucic acid is broken down long-chain acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) dehydrogenase, which is produced in the liver. This enzyme breaks this long chain fatty acid into shorter-chain fatty acids. human infants have relatively low amounts of this enzyme and because of this, babies should not be given foods high in erucic acid.

docoscoa,,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Docosanoyl-CoA is an acyl-CoA with the C-22 fatty acid Acyl chain moiety. Acyl-CoA (or formyl-CoA) is a coenzyme involved in the metabolism of fatty acids. It is a temporary compound formed when coenzyme A (CoA) attaches to the end of a long-chain fatty acid, inside living cells. The CoA is then removed from the chain, carrying two carbons from the chain with it, forming acetyl-CoA. This is then used in the citric acid cycle to start a chain of reactions, eventually forming many adenosine triphosphates. To be oxidatively degraded, a fatty acid must first be activated in a two-step reaction catalyzed by acyl-CoA synthetase. First, the fatty acid displaces the diphosphate group of ATP, then coenzyme A (HSCoA) displaces the AMP group to form an Acyl-CoA. The acyladenylate product of the first step has a large free energy of hydrolysis and conserves the free energy of the cleaved phosphoanhydride bond in ATP. The second step, transfer of the acyl group to CoA (the same molecule that carries acetyl groups as acetyl-CoA), conserves free energy in the formation of a thioester bond. Consequently, the overall reaction Fatty acid + CoA + ATP <=> Acyl-CoA + AMP + PPi has a free energy change near zero. Subsequent hydrolysis of the product PPi (by the enzyme inorganic pyrophosphatase) is highly exergonic, and this reaction makes the formation of acyl-CoA spontaneous and irreversible. Fatty acids are activated in the cytosol, but oxidation occurs in the mitochondria.

dolichol_L,2067-66-5,16091,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Dolichols are polyisoprenic molecule ubiquitously present in the lipid fraction of animal and plant tissues, discovered 40 years ago during experiments on the biosynthesis of ubiquinone. The molecular structure of dolichol comprises a sequence of unsaturated isoprenic units bearing a primary terminal hydroxyl group. The length of dolichyl chains depends on the species of the organism from which they are isolated. Mammalian dolichol generally is made up of 16 to 23 unsaturated isoprene units, and the terminal hydroxyl group may exist either free or esterified with fatty acids, phosphoric acid, and pyrophosphoric acid. In biological membranes, this linear polyisoprenoid compound may be located between the two leaflets of the lipid bilayer, close to the free end of the phospholipid fatty acid molecules. Metabolism and function of dolichol were largely unknown until recently. Synthesis of dolichol by the mevalonate pathway was demonstrated in vitro and in vivo in many tissues. The isoprenoid pyrophosphate intermediates are shared by the cholesterol, dolichol, and ubiquinone pathways, and treatment with drugs that block hydroxymethyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase may significantly decrease their plasma and tissue levels. In humans, there is no apparent positive correlation between serum dolichol and tissue dolichol and age. In view of the total content of the body, half life of the total body dolichol, and dolichol content in the extracellular space, it was concluded that the dolichol in tissues probably derives from biosynthesis in those tissues and that relocation of dolichol via circulation cannot be prominent in vivo. The levels of dolichol in human serum have apparently no correlation to age or serum total cholesterol, and exhibit a linear correlation to high density lipoprotein cholesterols which may reflect the fact that the dolichols are associated with the high-density lipoprotein fraction. No enzymic pathways for dolichol degradation were described, but no case of dolichol-storage disease was reported. Shrinkage of tissue because of increased lysosomal degradation in the process of atrophy does not affect the dolichol content and concentration increases. Small quantities of dolichol that may be excreted into the urine at least in part is derived from the lysosomes of the excretory organ, and serum dolichol levels may be elevated in chronic cholestatic liver diseases. Recent evidence shows that phagocytosis may cause the degradation and disposal of the engulfed dolichol, possibly because of nonenzymatic free radical mediated decomposition. By means of a 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analytical method, the hypothesis was substantiated that dolichol may act as a free-radical scavenger in the cell membranes and protect polyunsaturated fatty acids from peroxidation, and that it may undergo decomposition in the process.

The first subunit of the heterotrimer appears to be the actual catalyst, and the other two subunits appear to stabilize it. More specifically, dolichol-phosphate-mannose is the donor of mannose groups in the synthesis of the dolichol pyrophosphate-linked precursor oligosaccharide in asparagine-linked glycosylation, in the synthesis of glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor precursors, in protein O-mannosylation and in protein C-mannosylation. Its synthesis proceeds in two steps. First, cytosolic GDP-mannose reacts with dolichol phosphate exposed on the cytosolic face of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane to form DPM with its mannose moiety oriented toward the cytosol. The DPM molecule then flips in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, so that its mannose moiety is in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen, accessible to the enzymes that catalyze its transfer to growing glycolipids and glycoproteins.

dolp_L,34457-14-2,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Dolichol phosphate is the most prevalent polyisoprenyl-glycosyl carrier found in mammals. It is involved in reactions such as the C-4 and O-mannosylation of proteins, the formation of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors and the N-glycosylation of proteins. The chain length of eukaryotic dolichol molecules differs from 14 to 17 isoprene units in unicellular organisms like yeast whereas mammalian cells produce dolichol with 18-21 isoprene units. During the de novo synthesis of dolichol in eukaryotes, farnesyl pyrophosphate, a metabolite of cholesterol biosynthesis, is elongated by successive condensations to isopentenyl pyrophosphate molecules. These reactions are catalyzed by cis-isopentenyltransferases. After the polyisoprene pyrophosphate chain has reached its final length, both phosphate residues are released by mono- or pyrophosphatases. The isoprene unit of the polyprenol is then reduced by a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-dependent microsomal reductase. The final step in dolichol phosphate synthesis is catalyzed by dolichol kinase (DK1), an enzyme that transfers a phosphate from choline-phosphate cytidine triphosphate (CTP) to dolichol. Once synthesized, dolichol phosphate can react with cytosolic GDP-mannose in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane to form dolichyl phosphate D-mannose. A new inherited metabolic disorder, Dolichol kinase (DK1) deficiency has recently been discovered. Affected patients present with a very severe clinical phenotype, with death in early infancy. Symptoms include secondary microencephaly, dry, thin, parchmentlike skin, hyperkeratosis, minimal hair growth and muscular hypotonia.

dopa,62-31-7,18243,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Dopamine is a member of the catecholamine family of neurotransmitters in the brain and is a precursor to epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). Dopamine is synthesized in the body (mainly by nervous tissue and adrenal glands) first by the hydration of the amino acid tyrosine to DOPA by tyrosine hydroxylase and then by the decarboxylation of DOPA by aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase. Dopamine is a major transmitter in the extrapyramidal system of the brain, and important in regulating movement. A family of receptors (dopamine receptors) mediates its action, which plays a major role in reward-motivated behaviour. Dopamine has many other functions outside the brain. In blood vessels, dopamine inhibits norepinephrine release and acts as a vasodilator (at normal concentrations); in the kidneys, it increases sodium excretion and urine output; in the pancreas, it reduces insulin production; in the digestive system, it reduces gastrointestinal motility and protects intestinal mucosa; and in the immune system, it reduces the activity of lymphocytes. Parkinson's disease, a degenerative condition causing tremor and motor impairment, is caused by a loss of dopamine-secreting neurons in an area of the midbrain called the substantia nigra. There is evidence that schizophrenia involves altered levels of dopamine activity, and most antipsychotic drugs used to treat this are dopamine antagonists, which reduce dopamine activity. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, and addiction are also characterized by defects in dopamine production or metabolism. It has been suggested that animals derived their dopamine-synthesizing machinery from bacteria via horizontal gene transfer that may have occurred relatively late in evolutionary time. This is perhaps a result of the symbiotic incorporation of bacteria into eukaryotic cells that gave rise to mitochondria. Dopamine is elevated in the urine of people who consume bananas. When present in sufficiently high levels, dopamine can be a neurotoxin and a metabotoxin. A neurotoxin is a compound that disrupts or attacks neural tissue. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of dopamine are associated with neuroblastoma, Costello syndrome, leukemia, phaeochromocytoma, aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency, and Menkes disease (MNK).

L-alpha-amino acids are alpha-amino acids which have the L-configuration of the alpha-carbon atom. Dopaquinone is slightly soluble (in water) and a moderately acidic compound (based on its pKa). L-Dopaquinone is a metabolite of L-DOPA and a precursor of melanin. Melanin is synthesized from tyrosine by hydroxylation to dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) and subsequent oxidation to dopaquinone. Both reactions are catalyzed by the enzyme tyrosinase, which is the rate-limiting step. Dopaquinone has an ortho-quinone ring, which is known to be neurotoxic and highly reactive with many other compounds (PMID: 413870). Dopaquinone typically combines with cysteine to form pheomelanin (a pigment-polymer). Alternatively, dopaquinone can be converted to leucodopachrome and eventually to eumelanin (also a pigment-polymer). Dopaquinone can be found in skin and feces. Within the cell, dopaquinone is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Dopaquinone is involved in several metabolic disorders, some of which include transient tyrosinemia, hawkinsinuria, tyrosinemia type I, and alkaptonuria. Chronically high levels of dopaquinone are associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). Many Parkinson's patients are treated with L-DOPA. However, long-term treatment with L-DOPA may actually worsen symptoms or result in neurotic and psychotic symptoms.

Desmosterolosis is caused by mutation of the 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase gene (DHCR24). Many of the malformations in SLOS and desmosterolosis are consistent with impaired hedgehog function.

In gram negative bacteria such as Salmonella enterica, Vibrio cholerae or Escherichia coli 075:K5, l-rhamnose is an important residue in the O-antigen of lipopolysaccharides, which are essential for resistance to serum killing and for colonization. In gram positive bacteria, such as streptococci, the capsule is a recognized virulence factor, for example, l-rhamnose is known to be present in the capsule of Streptococcus suis, a causative agent of meningitis in humans. In Streptococcus mutans, l-rhamnose containing polysaccharides have been implicated in tooth surface colonization and adherence to kidney, muscle and heart tissues. In mycobacteria, l-rhamnose is fundamental to the structural integrity of the cell wall since it connects the inner peptidoglycan layer to the arabinogalactan polysaccharides. dTDP-l-rhamnose is synthesized from glucose-1-phosphate and deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP) via a pathway involving four distinct enzymes. Whereas common sugars such as glucose, fructose and mannose are all D-configured, bacteria commonly utilize the L-configured carbohydrates in pharmacologically active compounds and in their cell-wall structures.

dutp,1173-82-6,17625,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP) is a deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) that is chemically similar to uridine triphosphate (UTP) except that it has a deoxyribose sugar instead of a ribose sugar. DNA synthesis requires the availability of deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dTTP, dATP, dGTP, dCTP), whereas RNA synthesis requires the availability of nucleotide triphosphates (NTPs) such as TTP, ATP, GTP, and UTP. The conversion of nucleotide triphosphates (NTPs) into dNTPs can only be done in the diphosphate form. Typically, an NTP has one phosphate removed to become an NDP. This is then converted into a dNDP by an enzyme called ribonucleotide reductase and followed by the re-addition of phosphate to give a dNTP. dUTP is a substrate for several enzymes, including inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase, deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase (mitochondrial), uridine-cytidine kinase 1, nucleoside diphosphate kinase 3, nucleoside diphosphate kinase B, nucleoside diphosphate kinase 6, nucleoside diphosphate kinase (mitochondrial), nucleoside diphosphate kinase homolog 5, nucleoside diphosphate kinase A, and nucleoside diphosphate kinase 7. While UTP is routinely incorporated into RNA, dUTP is not normally incorporated into DNA. Instead, if dUTP is misincorporated into DNA, it can cause DNA damage. Therefore, dUTP can be considered as a teratogen or a mutagen. The extent of DNA damage caused by dUTP is highly dependent on the levels of the dUTP pyrophosphatase (dUTPase) and uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG), which limits the intracellular accumulation of dUTP. Additionally, loss of viability following thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibition occurs as a consequence of the accumulation of dUTP in some cell lines and subsequent misincorporation of uracil into DNA (PMID: 11487279).",Deoxyuridine triphosphate,HMDB0001191,,,C00460,DUTP,FDB022478,dutp,[H]O[C@@]1([H])C([H])([H])[C@@]([H])(O[C@]1([H])C([H])([H])OP([O-])(=O)OP([O-])(=O)OP([O-])([O-])=O)N1C([H])=C([H])C(=O)N([H])C1=O,2'-Deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate***2'-Deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphoric acid***Deoxyuridine triphosphoric acid***2'-Deoxyuridine-5'-triphosphorate***2'-Deoxyuridine-5'-triphosphoric acid***2'-Deoxyuridine-5'-triphosphoric acid = dUTP***Deoxy-UTP***Deoxyuridine-5'-triphosphate***dUTP,AHCYMLUZIRLXAA-SHYZEUOFSA-J,"InChI=1S/C9H15N2O14P3/c12-5-3-8(11-2-1-7(13)10-9(11)14)23-6(5)4-22-27(18,19)25-28(20,21)24-26(15,16)17/h1-2,5-6,8,12H,3-4H2,(H,18,19)(H,20,21)(H,10,13,14)(H2,15,16,17)/p-4/t5-,6+,8+/m0/s1"

Human platelets metabolize 8,11,14,17-eicosatetraenoic acid primarily into 12-hydroxy-8,10,14,17-eicosatetraenoic acid. The eicosanoids are a diverse family of molecules that have powerful effects on cell function. They are best known as intercellular messengers, having autocrine and paracrine effects following their secretion from the cells that synthesize them. The diversity of possible products that can be synthesized from eicosatrienoic acid is due, in part to the variety of enzymes that can act on it. Studies have placed many, but not all, of these enzymes at or inside the nucleus. In some cases, the nuclear import or export of eicosatrienoic acid-processing enzymes is highly regulated. Furthermore, nuclear receptors that are activated by specific eicosanoids are known to exist. Taken together, these findings indicate that the enzymatic conversion of eicosatrienoic acid to specific signaling molecules can occur in the nucleus, that it is regulated, and that the synthesized products may act within the nucleus.

elaidcrn,,86038,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Elaidic carnitine is an acylcarnitine. Numerous disorders have been described that lead to disturbances in energy production and in intermediary metabolism in the organism which are characterized by the production and excretion of unusual acylcarnitines. A mutation in the gene coding for carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase or the OCTN2 transporter aetiologically causes a carnitine deficiency that results in poor intestinal absorption of dietary L-carnitine, its impaired reabsorption by the kidney and, consequently, in increased urinary loss of L-carnitine. Determination of the qualitative pattern of acylcarnitines can be of diagnostic and therapeutic importance. The betaine structure of carnitine requires special analytical procedures for recording. The ionic nature of L-carnitine causes a high water solubility which decreases with increasing chain length of the ester group in the acylcarnitines. Therefore, the distribution of L-carnitine and acylcarnitines in various organs is defined by their function and their physico-chemical properties as well. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) permits screening for free and total carnitine, as well as complete quantitative acylcarnitine determination, including the long-chain acylcarnitine profile.

estradiol,50-28-2,16469,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Estradiol is the most potent form of mammalian estrogenic steroids. Estradiol is produced in the ovaries. The ovary requires both luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) to produce sex steroids. LH stimulates the cells surrounding the follicle to produce progesterone and androgens. The androgens diffuse across the basement membrane to the granulosa cell layer, where, under the action of FSH, they are aromatized to estrogens, mainly estradiol. The ovary shows cyclical activity, unlike the testis that is maintained in a more or less constant state of activity. Hormone secretions vary according to the phase of the menstrual cycle. In the developing follicle LH receptors (LH-R) are only located on the thecal cells and FSH receptors (FSHR) on the granulosa cells. The dominant pre-ovulatory follicle develops LH-Rs on the granulosa cells prior to the LH surge. Thecal cells of the preovulatory follicle also develop the capacity to synthesize estradiol and this persists when the thecal cells become incorporated into the corpus luteum. After ovulation, the empty follicle is remodelled and plays an important role in the second half or luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. This phase is dominated by progesterone and, to a lesser extent, estradiol secretion by the corpus luteum. estradiol is also synthesized locally from cholesterol through testosterone in the hippocampus and acts rapidly to modulate neuronal synaptic plasticity. Localization of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) in spines in addition to nuclei of principal neurons implies that synaptic ERalpha is responsible for rapid modulation of synaptic plasticity by endogenous estradiol. estradiol is a potent endogenous antioxidant which suppresses hepatic fibrosis in animal models, and attenuates induction of redox sensitive transcription factors, hepatocyte apoptosis and hepatic stellate cells activation by inhibiting a generation of reactive oxygen species in primary cultures. This suggests that the greater progression of hepatic fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in men and postmenopausal women may be due, at least in part, to lower production of estradiol and a reduced response to the action of estradiol. estradiol has been reported to induce the production of interferon (INF)-gamma in lymphocytes, and augments an antigen-specific primary antibody response in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. IFN-gamma is a potent cytokine with immunomodulatory and antiproliferative properties. Therefore, female subjects, particularly before menopause, may produce antibodies against hepatitis B virus e antigen and hepatitis B virus surface antigen at a higher frequency than males with chronic hepatitis B virus infection. The estradiol-Dihydrotestosterone model of prostate cancer (PC) proposes that the first step in the development of most PC and breast cancer (BC) occurs when aromatase converts testosterone to estradiol.

estriol,50-27-1,27974,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Estriol is a metabolite of estrone metabolized via 16alpha-hydroxyestrone through the enzyme 16alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.147) or to 2- or 4-hydroxyestrone (catechol estrogens) by the action of catecho-O-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.6). The latter metabolites can be formed in the brain and may compete with receptors for catecholamines. Metabolites are conjugated with sulfate or glucuronide before excretion by the kidney. During pregnancy, estriol constitutes 60-70% of the total estrogens, increasing to 300-500-fold in relation to non-pregnant women. The late term human fetus produces relatively large amounts of 16 alphahydroxy DHEA, which serves the mother as a precursor of estriol. It has been shown that 90% of the precursors for the formation of estriol are of fetal origin. If abnormal maternal serum screening results, specifically low levels of unconjugated estriol in the second trimester are detected, a diagnosis of Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS),or RSH is suspected. SLOS is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations of the gene encoding 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (EC 1.3.1.21, DHCR7).

estrone,53-16-7,17263,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Estrone is a major mammalian estrogen. The conversion of the natural C19 steroids, testosterone and androstenedione into estrone is dependent on a complex key reaction catalyzed by the cytochrome P450 aromatase (EC 1.14.14.1, unspecific monooxygenase), which is expressed in many tissues of the adult human (e.g. ovary, fat tissue), but not in the liver. The ovaries after menopause continue to produce androstenedione and testosterone in significant amounts and these androgens are converted in fat, muscle, and skin into estrone. When women between the ages of 45 and 64 years have prophylactic oophorectomy (when hysterectomy is performed for benign disease to prevent the development of ovarian cancer), evidence suggests that oophorectomy increases the subsequent risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and osteoporosis. Whereas 14,000 women die of ovarian cancer every year nearly 490,000 women die of heart disease and 48,000 women die within 1 year after hip fracture. Therefore, the decision to perform prophylactic oophorectomy should be approached with great caution for the majority of women who are at low risk of developing ovarian cancer. Steroid sulfatase (EC 3.1.6.2, STS) hydrolyzes steroid sulfates, such as estrone sulfate to estrone which can be converted to steroids with potent estrogenic properties, that is, estradiol; STS activity is much higher in breast tumors and high levels of STS mRNA expression in tumors are associated with a poor prognosis. The biological roles of estrogens in tumorigenesis are certainly different between the endometrium and breast, although both are considered ""estrogen-dependent tissues"". 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (EC 1.1.1.62, 17-HSDs) are enzymes involved in the formation of active sex steroids. estrone is interconverted by two enzymes 17-HSD types. Type 1 converts estrone to estradiol and Type 2 catalyzes the reverse reaction.

ethmalac,601-75-2,741548,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Ethylmalonic acid, also known as alpha-carboxybutyric acid or ethylmalonate, is a member of the class of compounds known as branched fatty acids. Branched fatty acids are fatty acids containing one or more branched chains. Ethylmalonic acid is soluble (in water) and a moderately acidic compound (based on its pKa). Ethylmalonic acid can be synthesized from malonic acid, and can be synthesized into (S)-ethylmalonyl-CoA and (R)-ethylmalonyl-CoA. Ethylmalonic acid can be found in blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and urine, as well as in human fibroblasts, prostate, and skeletal muscle tissues. Moreover, ethylmalonic acid is found to be associated with anorexia nervosa and malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency. Ethylmalonic acid is a non-carcinogenic (not listed by IARC) potentially toxic compound. Chronically high levels of ethylmalonic acid are associated with at least two inborn errors of metabolism, including short chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (SCAD deficiency) and ethylmalonic encephalopathy. Ethylmalonic acid is identified in the urine of patients with short-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency, which is a fatty acid metabolism disorder. When present in sufficiently high levels, ethylmalonic acid can act as an acidogen and a metabotoxin. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Ethylmalonic acid is an organic acid. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart abnormalities, kidney abnormalities, liver damage, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of the untreated IEMs mentioned above. Many affected children with organic acidemias experience intellectual disability or delayed development.

etoh,64-17-5,16236,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Ethanol is a clear, colorless liquid rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and distributed throughout the body. It has bactericidal activity and is used often as a topical disinfectant. It is widely used as a solvent and preservative in pharmaceutical preparations as well as serving as the primary ingredient in alcoholic beverages. Indeed, ethanol has widespread use as a solvent of substances intended for human contact or consumption, including scents, flavorings, colorings, and medicines. Ethanol has a depressive effect on the central nervous system and because of its psychoactive effects, it is considered a drug. Ethanol has a complex mode of action and affects multiple systems in the brain, most notably it acts as an agonist to the GABA receptors. Death from ethanol consumption is possible when blood alcohol level reaches 0.4%. A blood level of 0.5% or more is commonly fatal. Levels of even less than 0.1% can cause intoxication, with unconsciousness often occurring at 0.3-0.4 %. Ethanol is metabolized by the body as an energy-providing carbohydrate nutrient, as it metabolizes into acetyl CoA, an intermediate common with glucose metabolism, that can be used for energy in the citric acid cycle or for biosynthesis. Ethanol within the human body is converted into acetaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase and then into acetic acid by acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. The product of the first step of this breakdown, acetaldehyde, is more toxic than ethanol. Acetaldehyde is linked to most of the clinical effects of alcohol. It has been shown to increase the risk of developing cirrhosis of the liver,[77] multiple forms of cancer, and alcoholism. Industrially, ethanol is produced both as a petrochemical, through the hydration of ethylene, and biologically, by fermenting sugars with yeast. Small amounts of ethanol are endogenously produced by gut microflora through anaerobic fermentation. However most ethanol detected in biofluids and tissues likely comes from consumption of alcoholic beverages. Absolute ethanol or anhydrous alcohol generally refers to purified ethanol, containing no more than one percent water. Absolute alcohol is not intended for human consumption. It often contains trace amounts of toxic benzene (used to remove water by azeotropic distillation). Consumption of this form of ethanol can be fatal over a short time period.

fald,50-00-0,16842,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Formaldehyde is a highly reactive aldehyde gas formed by oxidation or incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. In solution, it has a wide range of uses: in the manufacture of resins and textiles, as a disinfectant, and as a laboratory fixative or preservative. Formaldehyde solution (formalin) is considered a hazardous compound, and its vapor toxic. (From Reynolds, Martindale The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p717) -- Pubchem; The chemical compound formaldehyde (also known as methanal), is a gas with a pungent smell. It is the simplest aldehyde. Its chemical formula is H2CO. Formaldehyde was first synthesized by the Russian chemist Aleksandr Butlerov in 1859 but was conclusively identified by August Wilhelm van Hofmann in 1867. Although formaldehyde is a gas at room temperature, it is readily soluble in water, and it is most commonly sold as a 37% solution in water called by trade names such as formalin or formol. In water, formaldehyde polymerizes, and formalin actually contains very little formaldehyde in the form of H2CO monomer. Usually, these solutions contain a few percent methanol to limit the extent of polymerization. Formaldehyde exhibits most of the general chemical properties of the aldehydes, except that is generally more reactive than other aldehydes. Formaldehyde is a potent electrophile. It can participate in electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions with aromatic compounds and can undergo electrophilic addition reactions with alkenes. In the presence of basic catalysts, formaldehyde undergoes a Cannizaro reaction to produce formic acid and methanol. Because formaldehyde resins are used in many construction materials, including plywood, carpet, and spray-on insulating foams, and because these resins slowly give off formaldehyde over time, formaldehyde is one of the more common indoor air pollutants. At concentrations above 0.1 mg/kg in air, inhaled formaldehyde can irritate the eyes and mucous membranes, resulting in watery eyes, headache, a burning sensation in the throat, and difficulty breathing. -- Wikipedia.",Formaldehyde,HMDB0001426,,,C00067,FORMALDEHYDE,FDB009445,fald,[H]C([H])=O,Formaldehyd***FORMALIN***Methanal***Methylene oxide***Oxomethane***Oxomethylene***Methaldehyde***Methylene glycol***Aldeide formica***Fannoform***Formalina***Formaline***Formalith***Formic aldehyde***Formol***Paraform,WSFSSNUMVMOOMR-UHFFFAOYSA-N,InChI=1S/CH2O/c1-2/h1H2

fe2,15438-31-0,29033,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Iron is a chemical element with the symbol Fe and atomic number 26. Iron makes up 5% of the Earth's crust and is second in abundance to aluminium among the metals and fourth in abundance among the elements. Physiologically, it. exists as an ion in the body. Iron (as Fe2+, ferrous ion) is a necessary trace element used by all known living organisms. Iron-containing enzymes, usually containing heme prosthetic groups, participate in catalysis of oxidation reactions in biology, and in transport of a number of soluble gases. Iron is an essential constituent of hemoglobin, cytochrome, and other components of respiratory enzyme systems. Its chief functions are in the transport of oxygen to tissue (hemoglobin) and in cellular oxidation mechanisms. Inorganic iron involved in redox reactions is also found in the iron-sulfur clusters of many enzymes, such as nitrogenase (involved in the synthesis of ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen) and hydrogenase. A class of non-heme iron proteins is responsible for a wide range of functions such as ribonucleotide reductase (reduces ribose to deoxyribose; DNA biosynthesis) and purple acid phosphatase (hydrolysis of phosphate esters). When the body is fighting a bacterial infection, the body sequesters iron inside of cells (mostly stored in the storage molecule ferritin) so that it cannot be used by bacteria. Depletion of iron stores may result in iron-deficiency anemia. Iron is used to build up the blood in anemia. Humans experience iron toxicity above 20 milligrams of iron for every kilogram of weight, and 60 milligrams per kilogram is a lethal dose. Over-consumption of iron, often the result of children eating large quantities of ferrous sulfate tablets intended for adult consumption, is the most common toxicological cause of death in children under six. The DRI lists the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for adults as 45 mg/day. For children under fourteen years old the UL is 40 mg/day.

fna5moxam,52450-38-1,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Acetyl-N-formyl-5-methoxykynurenamine (AFMK) results from the oxidative cleavage of the pyrrole ring during melatonin oxidation by myeloperoxidase (MPO), a superoxide anion (O)-dependent reaction. AFMK is also expected to be formed from oxidation catalyzed by the unspecific enzyme indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), found in a variety of cell types including monocyte/macrophage lineages. MPO- and IDO-catalyzed melatonin oxidation has the requirement of O in common, a species formed in large amounts in inflammatory conditions. The non-enzymatic formation of AFMK can also be expected by its direct reaction with highly reactive oxygen species, such as hydroxyl radical and singlet oxygen. Thus, we assume that AFMK is a product formed in a route of melatonin metabolism, especially active in inflammation. As AFMK is biologically more active on leukocytes than melatonin, the metabolizing of melatonin to AFMK at inflammatory sites possibly plays a role in immunomodulation. AFMK is found in the CSF of patients with meningitis, and in some samples at a remarkably high concentration. AFMK was also found in some patients to exceed the concentration of melatonin normally found in serum (PMID: 16150112).",Acetyl-N-formyl-5-methoxykynurenamine,HMDB0004259,,,C05642,,FDB023355,fna5moxam,[H]N(C([H])=O)C1=C(C([H])=C(OC([H])([H])[H])C([H])=C1[H])C(=O)C([H])([H])C([H])([H])N([H])C(=O)C([H])([H])[H],AFMK***Formyl-N-acetyl-5-methoxykynurenamine***N-Acetyl-N-formyl-5-methoxykynurenamine***N-[3-(2-formamido-5-Methoxy-phenyl)-3-oxo-propyl]acetamide***N1-Acetyl-N2-formyl-5-methoxykynurenine***NSC 688263***K1,JYWNYMJKURVPFH-UHFFFAOYSA-N,"InChI=1S/C13H16N2O4/c1-9(17)14-6-5-13(18)11-7-10(19-2)3-4-12(11)15-8-16/h3-4,7-8H,5-6H2,1-2H3,(H,14,17)(H,15,16)"

It takes part in the metabolism of one-carbon compounds and its carbon may appear in methyl groups undergoing transmethylation. It is eventually oxidized to carbon dioxide. Formate is typically produced as a byproduct in the production of acetate. It is responsible for both metabolic acidosis and disrupting mitochondrial electron transport and energy production by inhibiting cytochrome oxidase activity, the terminal electron acceptor of the electron transport chain. Cell death from cytochrome oxidase inhibition by formate is believed to result partly from depletion of ATP, reducing energy concentrations so that essential cell functions cannot be maintained. Furthermore, inhibition of cytochrome oxidase by formate may also cause cell death by increased production of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) secondary to the blockade of the electron transport chain. In nature, formic acid is found in the stings and bites of many insects of the order Hymenoptera, including bees and ants.

fru,53188-23-1,28645,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Fructose, or levulose, is a levorotatory monosaccharide and an isomer of glucose (C6H12O6). The chemical composition of fructose is (C6H12O6). Pure fructose has a sweet taste similar to cane sugar, but with a ""fruity"" aroma. Although fructose is a hexose (6 carbon sugar), it generally exists as a 5-member hemiketal ring (a furanose). This structure is responsible for the long metabolic pathway and high reactivity compared to glucose. Fructose is found in many foods and is one of the three most important blood sugars along with glucose and galactose. Honey; tree fruits; berries; melons; and some root vegetables, such as beets, sweet potatoes, parsnips and onions, contain fructose, usually in combination with sucrose and glucose. Fructose is also derived from the digestion of sucrose, a disaccharide consisting of glucose and fructose that is broken down by enzymes during digestion. Fructose is the sweetest naturally occurring sugar, estimated to be twice as sweet as sucrose. It is used as a preservative and an intravenous infusion in parenteral feeding. Fructose is a reducing sugar, as are all monosaccharides. The spontaneous addition of single sugar molecules to proteins, known as glycation, is a significant cause of damage in diabetics. Fructose appears to be as dangerous as glucose in this regard and so does not seem to be the answer for diabetes (McPherson et al, 1988). This may be an important contribution to senescence and many age-related chronic diseases (Levi & Werman 1998).",D-Fructose,HMDB0000660,,,C02336,BETA-D-FRUCTOSE,FDB012528,fru,[H]OC([H])([H])[C@@]1([H])O[C@](O[H])(C([H])([H])O[H])[C@@]([H])(O[H])[C@]1([H])O[H],"D-lyxo-2-Hexulose***D-lyxo-Hex-2-ulose***D-Tag***lyxo-2-Hexulose***lyxo-Hexulose***Tagatose***Tagatose, (D)-isomer***Tagatose, (beta-D)-isomer***Tagatose, (alpha-D)-isomer***Tagatose, (DL)-isomer",RFSUNEUAIZKAJO-ARQDHWQXSA-N,"InChI=1S/C6H12O6/c7-1-3-4(9)5(10)6(11,2-8)12-3/h3-5,7-11H,1-2H2/t3-,4-,5+,6-/m1/s1"

fuc_L,2438-80-4,2181,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Fucose is a hexose deoxy sugar with the chemical formula C6H12O5. L-fucose (6-deoxy-L-galactose) is a monosaccharide that is a common component of many N- and O-linked glycans and glycolipids produced by mammalian cells. It is the fundamental sub-unit of the fucoidan polysaccharide. As a free sugar, L-fucose is normally found at very low levels in mammals. It is unique in that it is the only levorotatory sugar synthesized and utilized by mammals. Fucose polymers are synthesized by fucosyltransferases.  All fucosyltransferases utilize a nucleotide-activated form of fucose, GDP-fucose, as a fucose donor in the construction of fucosylated oligosaccharides. The ABO blood group antigens are among the most well known fucosylated glycans. The alpha-1->3 linked core fucose is a suspected carbohydrate antigen for IgE-mediated allergy. Two structural features distinguish fucose from other six-carbon sugars present in mammals: the lack of a hydroxyl group on the carbon at the 6-position (C-6) and the L-configuration. In fucose-containing glycan structures, fucosylated glycans, fucose can exist as a terminal modification or serve as an attachment point for adding other sugars. Fucose is metabolized by an enzyme called alpha-fucosidase. Fucose is secreted in urine when the liver is damaged.  Free L-fucose in serum and urine can be used as a marker for cancer, cirrhosis, alcoholic liver disease and gastric ulcers (PMID: 2311216) (PMID: 8488966). Elevated levels of serum fucose have been reported in breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, liver cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

fum,110-17-8,18012,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Fumaric acid is a dicarboxylic acid. It is a precursor to L-malate in the Krebs tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. It is formed by the oxidation of succinic acid by succinate dehydrogenase. Fumarate is converted by the enzyme fumarase to malate. Fumaric acid has recently been identified as an oncometabolite or an endogenous, cancer causing metabolite. High levels of this organic acid can be found in tumors or biofluids surrounding tumors. Its oncogenic action appears to due to its ability to inhibit prolyl hydroxylase-containing enzymes. In many tumours, oxygen availability becomes limited (hypoxia) very quickly due to rapid cell proliferation and limited blood vessel growth. The major regulator of the response to hypoxia is the HIF transcription factor (HIF-alpha). Under normal oxygen levels, protein levels of HIF-alpha are very low due to constant degradation, mediated by a series of post-translational modification events catalyzed by the prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing enzymes PHD1, 2 and 3, (also known as EglN2, 1 and 3) that hydroxylate HIF-alpha and lead to its degradation. All three of the PHD enzymes are inhibited by fumarate. Fumaric acid is found to be associated with fumarase deficiency, which is an inborn error of metabolism.",Fumaric acid,HMDB0000134,,,C00122,FUM,FDB003291,fum,[H]\C(=C(\[H])C([O-])=O)C([O-])=O,"(2E)-2-Butenedioic acid***(e)-2-Butenedioic acid***e297***Fumarsaeure***trans-1,2-Ethylenedicarboxylic acid***trans-But-2-enedioic acid***trans-Butenedioic acid***(2E)-2-Butenedioate***Fumarate***(e)-2-Butenedioate***trans-1,2-Ethylenedicarboxylate***trans-But-2-enedioate***trans-Butenedioate***(2E)-But-2-enedioate***(2E)-But-2-enedioic acid***2-(e)-Butenedioate***2-(e)-Butenedioic acid***Allomaleate***Allomaleic acid***Boletate***Boletic acid***FC 33***Lichenate***Lichenic acid***Sodium fumarate***trans-2-Butenedioate***trans-2-Butenedioic acid***Furamag***Ammonium fumarate***Magnesium fumarate",VZCYOOQTPOCHFL-OWOJBTEDSA-L,"InChI=1S/C4H4O4/c5-3(6)1-2-4(7)8/h1-2H,(H,5,6)(H,7,8)/p-2/b2-1+"

As an osmolyte, Glycerophosphorylcholine counteracts the effects of urea on enzymes and other macromolecules. Kidneys (especially medullar cells), which are exposed under normal physiological conditions to widely fluctuating extracellular solute concentrations, respond to hypertonic stress by accumulating the organic osmolytes glycerophosphorylcholine (GPC), betaine, myo-inositol, sorbitol and free amino acids. Increased intracellular contents of these osmolytes are achieved by a combination of increased uptake (myo-inositol and betaine) and synthesis (sorbitol, GPC), decreased degradation (GPC) and reduced osmolyte release.

g6p,56-73-5,4170,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Glucose 6 phosphate (alpha-D-glucose 6 phosphate or G6P) is the alpha-anomer of glucose-6-phosphate. There are two anomers of glucose 6 phosphate, the alpha anomer and the beta anomer. Glucose 6 phosphate is an ester of glucose with phosphoric acid, made in the course of glucose metabolism by mammalian and other cells. It is a normal constituent of resting muscle and probably is in constant equilibrium with fructose-6-phosphate. (Stedman, 26th ed). Glucose-6-phosphate is a phosphorylated glucose molecule on carbon 6. When glucose enters a cell, it is immediately phosphorylated to G6P. This is catalyzed with hexokinase enzymes, thus consuming one ATP. A major reason for immediate phosphorylation of the glucose is so that it cannot diffuse out of the cell. The phosphorylation adds a charged group so the G6P cannot easily cross cell membranes. G6P can travel down two metabolic pathways, glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway. In addition to the metabolic pathways, G6P can also be stored as glycogen in the liver if blood glucose levels are high. If the body needs energy or carbon skeletons for syntheses, G6P can be isomerized to Fructose-6-phosphate and then phosphorylated to Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. Note, the molecule now has 2 phosphoryl groups attached. The addition of the 2nd phosphoryl group is an irreversible step, so once this happens G6P will enter glycolysis and be turned into pyruvate (ATP production occurs). If blood glucose levels are high, the body needs a way to store the excess glucose. After being converted to G6P, phosphoglucose mutase (isomerase) can turn the molecule into glucose-1-phosphate. Glucose-1-phosphate can then be combined with uridine triphosphate (UTP) to form UDP-glucose. This reaction is driven by the hydrolysis of pyrophosphate that is released in the reaction. Now, the activated UDP-glucose can add to a growing glycogen molecule with the help of glycogen synthase. This is a very efficient storage mechanism for glucose since it costs the body only 1 ATP to store the 1 glucose molecule and virtually no energy to remove it from storage. It is important to note that glucose-6-phosphate is an allosteric activator of glycogen synthase, which makes sense because when the level of glucose is high the body should store the excess glucose as glycogen. On the other hand, glycogen synthase is inhibited when it is phosphorylated by protein kinase a during times of high stress or low blood glucose levels. -- Wikipedia.",Glucose 6-phosphate,HMDB0001401,,,C00092,GLC-6-P,FDB021818,g6p,[H]OC1([H])O[C@]([H])(C([H])([H])OP([O-])([O-])=O)[C@@]([H])(O[H])[C@]([H])(O[H])[C@@]1([H])O[H],6-O-phosphono-D-Glucopyranose***D-Glucose 6-phosphate***GLC6p***Robison ester***Glucose 6-phosphoric acid***D-Glucose 6-phosphoric acid***a-D-Glucose 6- phosphate***alpha-D-Glucose 6- phosphate***alpha-D-Glucose 6-phosphate***alpha-D-Hexose 6-phosphate***D(+)-Glucopyranose 6-phosphate***D-Glucose-6-dihydrogen phosphate***D-Hexose 6-phosphate***Glucose-6-phosphate,NBSCHQHZLSJFNQ-GASJEMHNSA-L,"InChI=1S/C6H13O9P/c7-3-2(1-14-16(11,12)13)15-6(10)5(9)4(3)8/h2-10H,1H2,(H2,11,12,13)/p-2/t2-,3-,4+,5-,6?/m1/s1"

There are two anomers of glucose 6 phosphate, the alpha anomer and the beta anomer. Specifically, beta-D-Glucose 6-phosphate is glucose sugar phosphorylated on carbon 6. It is a very common metabolite in cells as the vast majority of glucose entering a cell will become phosphorylated in this way. The primary reason for the immediate phosphorylation of glucose is to prevent diffusion out of the cell. The phosphorylation adds a charged phosphate group so the glucose 6-phosphate cannot easily cross the cell membrane. b-G6P is involved in the glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, pentose phosphate, and glycogen and sucrose metabolic pathways [Kegg ID: C01172]. Beta-D-Glucose 6 phosphate can be generated through beta-D-fructose phosphate or alpha-D-glucose 6 phosphate (via glucose-6-phosphate isomerase) or beta-D glucose (via hexokinase). It can then be sent off to the pentose phosphate pathway which generates the useful cofactor NADPH as well as ribulose 5-phosphate, a carbon source for the synthesis of other molecules. Alternately if the cell needs energy or carbon skeletons for synthesis then glucose 6-phosphate is targeted for glycolysis.

D-Galactose is an energy-providing nutrient and also a necessary basic substrate for the biosynthesis of many macromolecules in the body. Metabolic pathways for D-Galactose are important not only for the provision of these pathways but also for the prevention of D-Galactose and D-Galactose metabolite accumulation. The main source of D-Galactose is lactose in the milk of mammals, but it can also be found in some fruits and vegetables. Utilization of D-Galactose in all living cells is initiated by the phosphorylation of the hexose by the enzyme galactokinase (E.C. 2.7.1.6) (GALK) to form D-Galactose-1-phosphate. In the presence of D-Galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (E.C. 2.7.7.12) (GALT) D-Galactose-1-phosphate is exchanged with glucose-1-phosphate in UDP-glucose to form UDP-galactose. Glucose-1-phosphate will then enter the glycolytic pathway for energy production. Deficiency of the enzyme GALT in galactosemic patients leads to the accumulation of D-Galactose-1-phosphate. Classic galactosemia-a term that denotes the presence of D-Galactose in the blood is the rare inborn error of D-Galactose metabolism, diagnosed by the deficiency of the second enzyme of the D-Galactose assimilation pathway, GALT, which, in turn, is caused by mutations at the GALT gene.

galctn_D,13382-27-9,16534,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Galactonic acid is a sugar acid that is a metabolic breakdown product of galactose. Galactose dehydrogenase is responsible for converting galactose to galactonolactone, which then spontaneously or enzymatically converts to galactonic acid. Once formed, galactonic acid may enter the pentose phosphate pathway. Galactonic acid is increased in red blood cells of galactosemic patients, due to a galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT) deficiency (PMID: 14680973, OMMBID: The Online Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease, Ch.72). When present in sufficiently high levels, galactonic acid can act as an acidogen and a metabotoxin. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of galactonic acid are associated with at least two inborn errors of metabolism, including galactosemia and galactosemia type II. Galactonic acid is an organic acid. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart abnormalities, liver abnormalities (jaundice), kidney abnormalities, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of untreated galactosemia. Many affected children with organic acidemias experience intellectual disability or delayed development. High levels of galactonic acid in infants are specifically associated with hepatomegaly (an enlarged liver), cirrhosis, renal failure, cataracts, vomiting, seizure, hypoglycemia, lethargy, brain damage, and ovarian failure.",Galactonic acid,HMDB0000565,,,C00880,,FDB022122,,,"D-Galactonic acid***D-Galactonate***Galactonate***Galactonic acid, (D)-isomer***Galactonic acid, monopotassium salt***Galactonic acid, (L)-isomer",RGHNJXZEOKUKBD-MGCNEYSASA-N,

galside_hs,,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Galactosylceramides (GalCer) are non-acidic monoglycosphingolipids, i.e. a sphingolipid with one carbohydrate moiety attached to a ceramide unit. They are an intermediate in sphingolipid metabolism and is the second to last step in the synthesis of digalactosylceramidesulfate. GalCer is generated from ceramide via the enzyme UDP-galactose ceramide galactosyltransferase [EC:2.4.1.47]. It can be converted to digalactosylceramide via the enzyme glycosyltransferases [EC 2.4.1.-]. Galactosylceramide is the principal glycosphingolipid in brain tissue, hence the trivial name ""cerebroside"", which was first conferred on it in 1874. Galactosylceramides are found in all nervous tissues, but they can amount to 2% of the dry weight of grey matter and 12% of white matter. They are major constituents of oligodendrocytes. Synthesis of galactosylceramide takes place on the lumenal surface of the endoplasmic reticulum, although it has free access to the cytosolic surface by an energy-independent flip-flop process. GalCer sits in the extracellular leaflet of cell membranes in nanometer sized domains or rafts. The local clustering of GalCer within rafts is thought to facilitate the initial adhesion of certain viruses, including HIV-1 and bacteria to cells through multivalent interactions between receptor proteins and GalCer. A defect in the degradation of cerbrosides leads to a disorder called Krabbe disease. Krabbe disease (also known as globoid cell leukodystrophy or galactosylceramide lipidosis) is a rare, often fatal degenerative disorder that affects the myelin sheath of the nervous system. Krabbe disease is caused by mutations in the GALC gene, which causes a deficiency of galactosylceramidase. Infants with Krabbe disease are normal at birth. Symptoms begin between the ages of 3 and 6 months with irritability, fevers, limb stiffness, seizures, feeding difficulties, vomiting, and slowing of mental and motor development. There are also juvenile- and adult-onset cases of Krabbe disease, which have similar symptoms but slower progression. In infants, the disease is generally fatal before age 2. Patients with late-onset Krabbe disease tend to have a slower progression of the disease and live significantly longer.Cerebrosides are glycosphingolipids. There are four types of glycosphingolipids, the cerebrosides, sulfatides, globosides and gangliosides. Cerebrosides have a single sugar group linked to ceramide. The most common are galactocerebrosides (containing galactose), the least common are glucocerebrosides (containing glucose). Galactocerebrosides are found predominantly in neuronal cell membranes. In contrast glucocerebrosides are not normally found in membranes. Instead, they are typically intermediates in the synthesis or degradation of more complex glycosphingolipids. Galactocerebrosides are synthesized from ceramide and UDP-galactose. Excess lysosomal accumulation of glucocerebrosides is found in Gaucher disease.",Galactosylceramide (d18:1/16:0),HMDB0010708,,,C02686,,FDB027858,galside_hs,[H]OC([H])([H])[C@@]1([H])O[C@@]([H])(OC([H])([H])[C@]([H])(N([H])C([*])=O)[C@]([H])(O[H])C(\[H])=C(/[H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])[H])[C@]([H])(O[H])[C@@]([H])(O[H])[C@@]1([H])O[H],a-GalCer***alpha-GalCer***Cerebroside***D-Galactosyl-N-acylsphingosine***D-Galactosylceramide***delta-Galactosyl-N-acylsphingosine***delta-Galactosylceramide***Gal-b-cer***Gal-beta-1-1'cer***Gal-beta-cer***Galactocerebroside***Galactosylceramide***GalCer***N-(Hexadecanoyl)-1-b-galactosyl-sphing-4-enine***N-(Hexadecanoyl)-1-beta-galactosyl-sphing-4-enine,VJLLLMIZEJJZTE-DQVPDRNHSA-N,
galt,608-66-2,16813,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Galactitol or dulcitol is a sugar alcohol that is a metabolic breakdown product of galactose. Galactose is derived from lactose in food (such as dairy products). When lactose is broken down by the enzyme lactase it produces glucose and galactose. Galactitol has a slightly sweet taste. It is produced from galactose in a reaction catalyzed by aldose reductase. When present in sufficiently high levels, galactitol can act as a metabotoxin, a neurotoxin, and a hepatotoxin. A neurotoxin is a compound that disrupts or attacks neural cells and neural tissue. A hepatotoxin as a compound that disrupts or attacks liver tissue or liver cells. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of galactitol are associated with at least two inborn errors of metabolism, including galactosemia and galactosemia type II. Galactosemia is a rare genetic metabolic disorder that affects an individual's ability to metabolize the sugar galactose properly. Excess lactose consumption in individuals with galactose intolerance or galactosemia activates aldose reductase to produce galactitol, thus depleting NADPH and leading to lowered glutathione reductase activity. As a result, hydrogen peroxide or other free radicals accumulate causing serious oxidative damage to various cells and tissues. In individuals with galactosemia, the enzymes needed for the further metabolism of galactose (galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase) are severely diminished or missing entirely, leading to toxic levels of galactose 1-phosphate, galactitol, and galactonate. High levels of galactitol in infants are specifically associated with hepatomegaly (an enlarged liver), cirrhosis, renal failure, cataracts, vomiting, seizure, hypoglycemia, lethargy, brain damage, and ovarian failure.",Galactitol,HMDB0000107,,,C01697,15-DIDEOXY-15-IMINO-D-GALACTITOL,FDB006453,galt,[H]OC([H])([H])[C@]([H])(O[H])[C@@]([H])(O[H])[C@@]([H])(O[H])[C@]([H])(O[H])C([H])([H])O[H],"(2R,3S,4R,5S)-Hexane-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexol***D-Dulcitol***D-Galactitol***Dulcitol***Dulcose***Euonymit***L-Galactitol***Melampyrin***Melampyrit***Ambap5938***Dulcite***Hexitol***Melampyrite***Melampyrum***meso-Galactitol",FBPFZTCFMRRESA-GUCUJZIJSA-N,"InChI=1S/C6H14O6/c7-1-3(9)5(11)6(12)4(10)2-8/h3-12H,1-2H2/t3-,4+,5+,6-"

Since glucosamine is classified as a dietary supplement, evidence of safety and efficacy is not required as long as it is not advertised as a treatment for a medical condition. Nevertheless, glucosamine is a popular alternative medicine used by consumers for the treatment of osteoarthritis. Glucosamine is also extensively used in veterinary medicine as an unregulated but widely accepted supplement (Nolen RS, 2002). Treatment with oral glucosamine is commonly used for the treatment of osteoarthritis. Since glucosamine is a precursor for glycosaminoglycans, and glycosaminoglycans are a major component of joint cartilage, supplemental glucosamine may help to rebuild cartilage and treat arthritis. However, there is little evidence that any clinical effect of glucosamine works this way (Laverty et al., 2005; Biggee et al., 2005).

gchola,475-31-0,29746,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Glycocholic acid is an acyl glycine and a bile acid-glycine conjugate. It is a secondary bile acid produced by the action of enzymes existing in the microbial flora of the colonic environment. In hepatocytes, both primary and secondary bile acids undergo amino acid conjugation at the C-24 carboxylic acid on the side chain, and almost all bile acids in the bile duct therefore exist in a glycine conjugated form (PMID:16949895). More specifically, glycocholic acid or cholylglycine, is a crystalline bile acid involved in the emulsification of fats. It occurs as a sodium salt in the bile of mammals. Its anion is called glycocholate. As the glycine conjugate of cholic acid, this compound acts as a detergent to solubilize fats for absorption and is itself absorbed (PubChem). Bile acids are steroid acids found predominantly in bile of mammals. The distinction between different bile acids is minute, depends only on presence or absence of hydroxyl groups on positions 3, 7, and 12. Bile acids are physiological detergents that facilitate excretion, absorption, and transport of fats and sterols in the intestine and liver. Bile acids are also steroidal amphipathic molecules derived from the catabolism of cholesterol. They modulate bile flow and lipid secretion, are essential for the absorption of dietary fats and vitamins, and have been implicated in the regulation of all the key enzymes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Bile acids recirculate through the liver, bile ducts, small intestine and portal vein to form an enterohepatic circuit. They exist as anions at physiological pH and, consequently, require a carrier for transport across the membranes of the enterohepatic tissues.

It is a component the cell plasma membrane which modulates cell signal transduction events. Gangliosides have been found to be highly important in immunology. Ganglioside GD3 carries a net-negative charge at pH 7.0 and is acidic. Gangliosides can amount to 6% of the weight of lipids from brain, but they are found at low levels in all animal tissues. Gangliosides are glycosphingolipids. There are four types of glycosphingolipids, the cerebrosides, sulfatides, globosides and gangliosides. Gangliosides are very similar to globosides except that they also contain N-acetyl neuraminic acid (NANA) in varying amounts. The specific names for the gangliosides provide information about their structure. The letter G refers to ganglioside, and the subscripts M, D, T and Q indicate that the molecule contains mono-, di-, tri and quatra-sialic acid. The numbered subscripts 1, 2 and 3 refer to the carbohydrate sequence that is attached to the ceramide. In particular, 1 stands for GalGalNAcGalGlc-ceramide, 2 stands for GalNAcGalGlc-ceramide and 3 stands for GalGlc-ceramide. Deficiencies in lysosomal enzymes that degrade the carbohydrate portions of various gangliosides are responsible for a number of lysosomal storage diseases such as Tay-Sachs disease, Sandhoff disease, and GM1 gangliosidosis.

Fucose is a deoxyhexose that is found in nearly all plant and animal species. The monosaccharide plays several important metabolic roles in complex carbohydrates and in glycoproteins. Fucosylated oligosaccharides are involved in cell-cell recognition, selectin-mediated leukocyte-endothelial adhesion, and mouse embryogenesis. They form the basis of the Lewis-type blood group antigens, are involved in the formation of atherosclerosis, and mediate host-bacterial interactions. A decrease in the availability of fucose is associated with leukocyte adhesion deficiency type-II disorder, and fucosylated glycoproteins have been implicated in memory processes. Fucose is made available during the synthesis of fucosylated glycolipids, oligosaccharides, and glycoproteins via a sugar nucleotide intermediate, specifically GDP-L-fucose. GTP-L-fucose pyrophosphorylase (GFPP, E. C. 2.7.7.30) catalyzes the reversible condensation of guanosine triphosphate and beta-L-fucose-1-phosphate to form the nucleotide-sugar GDP-L-fucose.

In water solution both forms are in equilibrium and at pH 7 the cyclic one is the predominant. Glucose is a primary source of energy for living organisms. It is naturally occurring and is found in fruits and other parts of plants in its free state. In animals glucose arises from the breakdown of glycogen in a process known as glycogenolysis.

glcur1p,13168-11-1,35145,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): D-Glucuronic acid 1-phosphate is an end product of the UDP-glucuronic acid pathway. Formation of free glucuronic acid from UDP-glucuronic acid can be considered as the first step in the synthesis of vitamin C, a pathway that occurs in most vertebrates, although not in guinea pigs and primates, including humans. Free glucuronic acid can also be converted to pentose phosphate intermediates via the 'pentose pathway'. The latter is interrupted in subjects with pentosuria, who have a deficiency in l-xylulose reductase (EC 1.1.1.10, an enzyme that belongs to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family) and excrete abnormal amounts of l-xylulose. Some xenobiotics stimulate the formation of vitamin C in animals and enhance the excretion of l-xylulose in humans with pentosuria and have shown that aminopyrine, metyrapone and other xenobiotics cause an almost instantaneous increase in the conversion of UDP-glucuronic acid to glucuronic acid. It is usually stated that glucuronic acid formation from UDP-glucuronic acid is the result of two successive reactions comprising the hydrolysis of UDP-glucuronic acid to glucuronic acid 1-phosphate and UMP by nucleotide pyrophosphatase (E-NPP3, EC 3.6.1.9), followed by dephosphorylation of glucuronic acid 1-phosphate. Glucuronidation is responsible for conjugating potentially toxic lipophilic compounds with glucuronic acid, thereby producing molecules with greater aqueous solubility that is excreted more readily into urine and bile. The rate at which any compound may be glucuronidated depends on the concentration and activity of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferases as well as the concentration of the cofactor UDP-glucuronic acid. UDP-glucuronic acid is formed after oxidation of UDP-glucose by UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (UGDH, EC 1.1.1.22) with NAD as the electron acceptor. UDP-glucuronic acid may then be either used as the glucuronic acid donor for xenobiotic conjugation reactions by UDPglucuronosyltransferases (GlcAT-P, EC 2.4.1.17), or degraded to D-glucuronic acid 1-phosphate after the phosphodiester bond is cleaved by E-NPP3. E-NPP3 is the same enzyme that further reduces D-Glucuronic acid 1-phosphate to free D-glucuronic acid. Decreases in UDP-glucuronic acid concentration may be due to reduced availability of UDP-glucose or decreased UGDH activity or to increased activities of GlcAT-P or E-NPP3. Exposure to volatile anesthetics reduces hepatic UDP-glucuronic acid concentrations, and alters the rate of conjugation of compounds such as acetaminophen, bilirubin, diethylstilbestrol, iopanoic acid and valproic acid in a non-sex-dependent fashion in experimental mice. The depletion of UDP-glucuronic acid by anesthetics is caused by altered activity of microsomal E-NPP3.

gln_L,56-85-9,18050,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Glutamine (Gln) is one of the 20 amino acids encoded by the standard genetic code. In humans it is considered a non-essential amino acid. Structurally, glutamine is similar to the amino acid glutamic acid. However, instead of having a terminal carboxylic acid, it has an amide. Enzymatically, glutamine is formed by replacing a side-chain hydroxyl of glutamic acid with an amine functional group. Glutamine is found in foods high in proteins, such as fish, red meat, beans, and dairy products. Glutamine is often used as a supplement in weightlifting, bodybuilding, endurance and other sports, as well as by those who suffer from muscular cramps or pain, particularly elderly people. The main use of glutamine within the diet of either group is as a means of replenishing the body's stores of amino acids that have been used during exercise or everyday activities. Studies which have looked into problems with excessive consumption of glutamine thus far have proved inconclusive. However, normal supplementation is healthy mainly because glutamine is supposed to be supplemented after prolonged periods of exercise (for example, a workout or exercise in which amino acids are required for use) and replenishes amino acid stores. This is one of the main reasons glutamine is recommended during fasting or for people who suffer from physical trauma, immune deficiencies, or cancer. There is a significant body of evidence that links glutamine-enriched diets with positive intestinal effects. These include maintenance of gut barrier function, aiding intestinal cell proliferation and differentiation, as well as generally reducing septic morbidity and the symptoms of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). The reason for such ""cleansing"" properties is thought to stem from the fact that the intestinal extraction rate of glutamine is higher than that for other amino acids, and is therefore thought to be the most viable option when attempting to alleviate conditions relating to the gastrointestinal tract. These conditions were discovered after comparing plasma concentration within the gut between glutamine-enriched and non glutamine-enriched diets. However, even though glutamine is thought to have ""cleansing"" properties and effects, it is unknown to what extent glutamine has clinical benefits, due to the varied concentrations of glutamine in varieties of food. It is also known that glutamine has positive effects in reducing healing time after operations. Hospital waiting times after abdominal surgery are reduced by providing parenteral nutrition regimens containing amounts of glutamine to patients. Clinical trials have revealed that patients on supplementation regimes containing glutamine have improved nitrogen balances, generation of cysteinyl-leukotrienes from polymorphonuclear neutrophil granulocytes and improved lymphocyte recovery and intestinal permeability (in postoperative patients) - in comparison to those who had no glutamine within their dietary regime; all without any side-effects (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/glutamine).

glu_D,,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): There are two forms of glutamic acid found in nature: L-glutamic acid and D-glutamic acid. D-glutamic acid, is not endogenously produced in higher mammals. It is found naturally primarily in the cell walls of certain bacteria. D-glutamate is also present in certain foods e.g., soybeans and also arises from the turnover of the intestinal tract microflora, whose cell walls contain significant D-glutamate. Unlike other D-amino acids, D-glutamate is not oxidized by the D-amino acid oxidases, and therefore this detoxification pathway is not available for handling D-glutamate. Likewise, D-glutamic acid, when ingested, largely escapes most deamination reactions (unlike the L-counterpart). Free D-glutamate is found in mammalian tissue at surprisingly high levels, with D-glutamate accounting for 9% of the total glutamate present in liver. D-glutamate is the most potent natural inhibitor of glutathione synthesis identified to date and this may account for its localization to the liver, since circulating D-glutamate may alter redox stabiity (PMID 11158923). Certain eels are known to use D-glutamic acid as a phermone for chemical communication.",D-Glutamate,HMDB0003339,,,,,,,,,,
glu_L,56-86-0,16015,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Glutamic acid (Glu), also referred to as glutamate (the anion), is one of the 20 proteinogenic amino acids. It is not among the essential amino acids. Glutamate is a key molecule in cellular metabolism. In humans, dietary proteins are broken down by digestion into amino acids, which serves as metabolic fuel or other functional roles in the body. Glutamate is the most abundant fast excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian nervous system. At chemical synapses, glutamate is stored in vesicles. Nerve impulses trigger release of glutamate from the pre-synaptic cell. In the opposing post-synaptic cell, glutamate receptors, such as the NMDA receptor, bind glutamate and are activated. Because of its role in synaptic plasticity, it is believed that glutamic acid is involved in cognitive functions like learning and memory in the brain. Glutamate transporters are found in neuronal and glial membranes. They rapidly remove glutamate from the extracellular space. In brain injury or disease, they can work in reverse and excess glutamate can accumulate outside cells. This process causes calcium ions to enter cells via NMDA receptor channels, leading to neuronal damage and eventual cell death, and is called excitotoxicity. The mechanisms of cell death include: Damage to mitochondria from excessively high intracellular Ca2+. Glu/Ca2+-mediated promotion of transcription factors for pro-apoptotic genes, or downregulation of transcription factors for anti-apoptotic genes. Excitotoxicity due to glutamate occurs as part of the ischemic cascade and is associated with stroke and diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, lathyrism, and Alzheimer's disease. glutamic acid has been implicated in epileptic seizures. Microinjection of glutamic acid into neurons produces spontaneous depolarization around one second apart, and this firing pattern is similar to what is known as paroxysmal depolarizing shift in epileptic attacks. This change in the resting membrane potential at seizure foci could cause spontaneous opening of voltage activated calcium channels, leading to glutamic acid release and further depolarization (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamic_acid). Moreover, glutamic acid is found to be associated with N-acetylglutamate synthetase deficiency, which is an inborn error of metabolism.",L-Glutamic acid,HMDB0000148,,,C00025,GLT,FDB012535,glu_L,[H][N+]([H])([H])[C@]([H])(C([O-])=O)C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([O-])=O,"(S)-2-Aminopentanedioic acid***(S)-Glutamic acid***Acide glutamique***acido Glutamico***Acidum glutamicum***E***Glu***Glutamate***GLUTAMIC ACID***L-Glu***L-Glutaminic acid***L-Glutaminsaeure***(S)-2-Aminopentanedioate***L-Glutamate***(S)-Glutamate***L-Glutaminate***(2S)-2-Aminopentanedioate***(2S)-2-Aminopentanedioic acid***(S)-(+)-Glutamate***(S)-(+)-Glutamic acid***1-amino-Propane-1,3-dicarboxylate***1-amino-Propane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid***1-Aminopropane-1,3-dicarboxylate***1-Aminopropane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid***2-Aminoglutarate***2-Aminoglutaric acid***2-Aminopentanedioate***2-Aminopentanedioic acid***a-Aminoglutarate***a-Aminoglutaric acid***a-Glutamate***a-Glutamic acid***Aciglut***alpha-Aminoglutarate***alpha-Aminoglutaric acid***alpha-Glutamate***alpha-Glutamic acid***Aminoglutarate***Aminoglutaric acid***Glt***Glusate***Glut***Glutacid***Glutamicol***Glutamidex***Glutaminate***Glutaminic acid***Glutaminol***Glutaton***L-(+)-Glutamate***L-(+)-Glutamic acid***L-a-Aminoglutarate***L-a-Aminoglutaric acid***L-alpha-Aminoglutarate***L-alpha-Aminoglutaric acid***D Glutamate***Glutamate, potassium***Glutamic acid, (D)-isomer***L Glutamic acid***D-Glutamate***L Glutamate***Aluminum L glutamate***Aluminum L-glutamate***L-Glutamate, aluminum***Potassium glutamate",WHUUTDBJXJRKMK-VKHMYHEASA-M,"InChI=1S/C5H9NO4/c6-3(5(9)10)1-2-4(7)8/h3H,1-2,6H2,(H,7,8)(H,9,10)/p-1/t3-/m0/s1"

glutar,110-94-1,17859,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Glutaric acid is a simple five-carbon linear dicarboxylic acid. Glutaric acid is naturally produced in the body during the metabolism of some amino acids, including lysine and tryptophan. Glutaric acid may cause irritation to the skin and eyes. When present in sufficiently high levels, glutaric acid can act as an acidogen and a metabotoxin. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of glutaric acid are associated with at least three inborn errors of metabolism, including glutaric aciduria type I, malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency, and glutaric aciduria type III. Glutaric aciduria type I (glutaric acidemia type I, glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, GA1, or GAT1) is an inherited disorder in which the body is unable to completely break down the amino acids lysine, hydroxylysine, and tryptophan due to a deficiency of mitochondrial glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.99.7, GCDH). Excessive levels of their intermediate breakdown products (e.g. glutaric acid, glutaryl-CoA, 3-hydroxyglutaric acid, glutaconic acid) can accumulate and cause damage to the brain (and also other organs). Babies with glutaric acidemia type I are often born with unusually large heads (macrocephaly). Macrocephaly is amongst the earliest signs of GA1. GA1 also causes secondary carnitine deficiency because glutaric acid, like other organic acids, is detoxified by carnitine. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart, liver, and kidney abnormalities, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of untreated glutaric aciduria. Many affected children with organic acidemias experience intellectual disability or delayed development. In adults, acidosis or acidemia is characterized by headaches, confusion, feeling tired, tremors, sleepiness, and seizures. Treatment of glutaric aciduria is mainly based on the restriction of lysine intake, supplementation of carnitine, and an intensification of therapy during intercurrent illnesses. The major principle of dietary treatment is to reduce the production of glutaric acid and 3-hydroxyglutaric acid by restriction of natural protein, in general, and of lysine, in particular (PMID: 17465389, 15505398).",Glutaric acid,HMDB0000661,,,C00489,,FDB001477,,[H]C([H])(C([O-])=O)C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([O-])=O,"1,3-Propanedicarboxylic acid***1,5-Pentanedioic acid***Glutarsaeure***Pentanedioic acid***1,3-Propanedicarboxylate***Glutarate***1,5-Pentanedioate***Pentanedioate***Pentandioate***Pentandioic acid",JFCQEDHGNNZCLN-UHFFFAOYSA-L,"InChI=1S/C5H8O4/c6-4(7)2-1-3-5(8)9/h1-3H2,(H,6,7)(H,8,9)/p-2"

glx,298-12-4,16891,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Glyoxylic acid or oxoacetic acid is an organic compound that is both an aldehyde and a carboxylic acid. Glyoxylic acid is a liquid with a melting point of -93°C and a boiling point of 111°C. It is an intermediate of the glyoxylate cycle, which enables certain organisms to convert fatty acids into carbohydrates. The conjugate base of glyoxylic acid is known as glyoxylate (PMID: 16396466). In humans, glyoxylate is produced via two pathways: (1) through the oxidation of glycolate in peroxisomes and (2) through the catabolism of hydroxyproline in mitochondria. In the peroxisomes, glyoxylate is converted into glycine by glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT1) or into oxalate by glycolate oxidase. In the mitochondria, glyoxylate is converted into glycine by mitochondrial glyoxylate aminotransferase AGT2 or into glycolate by glycolate reductase. A small amount of glyoxylate is converted into oxalate by cytoplasmic lactate dehydrogenase. Glyoxylic acid is found to be associated with primary hyperoxaluria I, which is an inborn error of metabolism. Under certain circumstances, glyoxylate can be a nephrotoxin and a metabotoxin. A nephrotoxin is a compound that causes damage to the kidney and kidney tissues. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. High levels of glyoxylate are involved in the development of hyperoxaluria, a key cause of nephrolithiasis (commonly known as kidney stones). Glyoxylate is both a substrate and inductor of sulfate anion transporter-1 (SAT-1), a gene responsible for oxalate transportation, allowing it to increase SAT-1 mRNA expression, and as a result oxalate efflux from the cell. The increased oxalate release allows the buildup of calcium oxalate in the urine, and thus the eventual formation of kidney stones. As an aldehyde, glyoxylate is also highly reactive and will modify proteins to form advanced glycation products (AGEs).",Glyoxylic acid,HMDB0000119,,,C00048,GLYOX,FDB001478,glx,[H]C(=O)C([O-])=O,"alpha-Ketoacetic acid***Formylformic acid***Glyoxalate***Glyoxalsaeure***Glyoxylate***Glyoxylsaeure***Oxalaldehydic acid***Oxoethanoic acid***a-Ketoacetate***a-Ketoacetic acid***alpha-Ketoacetate***α-ketoacetate***α-ketoacetic acid***Formylformate***Glyoxalic acid***Oxalaldehydate***Oxoethanoate***Oxoacetate***Oxoacetic acid***Glyoxylic acid, 2-(14)C-labeled***Glyoxylic acid, sodium salt***Glyoxylic acid, sodium salt, 2-(14)C-labeled***Glyoxylic acid, 14c2-labeled***Glyoxylic acid, calcium salt***Glyoxylic acid, sodium salt, 14C-labeled",HHLFWLYXYJOTON-UHFFFAOYSA-M,"InChI=1S/C2H2O3/c3-1-2(4)5/h1H,(H,4,5)/p-1"
gly,56-40-6,15428,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Glycine is a simple, nonessential amino acid, although experimental animals show reduced growth on low-glycine diets. The average adult ingests 3 to 5 grams of glycine daily. Glycine is involved in the body's production of DNA, phospholipids and collagen, and in release of energy. Glycine levels are effectively measured in plasma in both normal patients and those with inborn errors of glycine metabolism (http://www.dcnutrition.com/AminoAcids/). Nonketotic hyperglycinaemia (OMIM 606899) is an autosomal recessive condition caused by deficient enzyme activity of the glycine cleavage enzyme system (EC 2.1.1.10). The glycine cleavage enzyme system comprises four proteins: P-, T-, H- and L-proteins (EC 1.4.4.2, EC 2.1.2.10 and EC 1.8.1.4 for P-, T- and L-proteins). Mutations have been described in the GLDC (OMIM 238300), AMT (OMIM 238310), and GCSH (OMIM 238330) genes encoding the P-, T-, and H-proteins respectively. The glycine cleavage system catalyses the oxidative conversion of glycine into carbon dioxide and ammonia, with the remaining one-carbon unit transferred to folate as methylenetetrahydrofolate. It is the main catabolic pathway for glycine and it also contributes to one-carbon metabolism. Patients with a deficiency of this enzyme system have increased glycine in plasma, urine and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with an increased CSF: plasma glycine ratio (PMID 16151895).

glyb,107-43-7,17750,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Betaine, (or N,N,N-trimethylglycine) was named after its discovery in sugar beet (Beta vulgaris) in the 19th century. It is a small N-trimethylated amino acid, existing in zwitterionic form at neutral pH. It is now often called glycine betaine to distinguish it from other betaines that are widely distributed in microorganisms, plants and animals.  Many naturally occurring betaines serve as organic osmolytes, substances synthesized or taken up from the environment by cells for protection against osmotic stress, drought, high salinity or high temperature. Intracellular accumulation of betaines permits water retention in cells, thus protecting from the effects of dehydration (Wikipedia). Betaine functions as a methyl donor in that it carries and donates methyl functional groups to facilitate necessary chemical processes. In particular it methylates homocysteine to methionine, also producing N,N-dimethylglycine. The donation of methyl groups is important to proper liver function, cellular replication, and detoxification reactions. Betaine also plays a role in the manufacture of carnitine and serves to protect the kidneys from damage. Betaine comes from either the diet or by the oxidation of choline. Betaine insufficiency is associated with the metabolic syndrome, lipid disorders and diabetes, and may have a role in vascular and other diseases (PMID: 20346934). Betaine is found to be associated with propionic acidemia, which is an inborn error of metabolism. Betaine is important in development, from the pre-implantation embryo to infancy. Betaine is also widely regarded as an anti-oxidant.

glyc,56-81-5,17522,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Glycerol or glycerin is a colourless, odourless, viscous liquid that is sweet-tasting and mostly non-toxic. It is widely used in the food industry as a sweetener and humectant and in pharmaceutical formulations. Glycerol is an important component of triglycerides (i.e. fats and oils) and of phospholipids. Glycerol is a three-carbon substance that forms the backbone of fatty acids in fats. When the body uses stored fat as a source of energy, glycerol and fatty acids are released into the bloodstream. The glycerol component can be converted into glucose by the liver and provides energy for cellular metabolism. Normally, glycerol shows very little acute toxicity and very high oral doses or acute exposures can be tolerated. On the other hand, chronically high levels of glycerol in the blood are associated with glycerol kinase deficiency (GKD). GKD causes the condition known as hyperglycerolemia, an accumulation of glycerol in the blood and urine. There are three clinically distinct forms of GKD: infantile, juvenile, and adult. The infantile form is the most severe and is associated with vomiting, lethargy, severe developmental delay, and adrenal insufficiency. The mechanisms of glycerol toxicity in infants are not known, but it appears to shift metabolism towards chronic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart, liver, and kidney abnormalities, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of untreated GKD.

It is a compound that is secreted excessively in the urine by patients suffering from D-glyceric aciduria, an inborn error of metabolism, and D-glycerate anemia. Deficiency of human glycerate kinase leads to D-glycerate acidemia/D-glyceric aciduria. Symptoms of the disease include progressive neurological impairment, hypotonia, seizures, failure to thrive, and metabolic acidosis. At sufficiently high levels, glyceric acid can act as an acidogen and a metabotoxin. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Glyceric acid is an organic acid. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis.

glyclt,79-14-1,17497,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Glycolic acid (or hydroxyacetic acid) is the smallest alpha-hydroxy acid (AHA). This colourless, odourless, and hygroscopic crystalline solid is highly soluble in water. Due to its excellent capability to penetrate skin, glycolic acid is often used in skin care products, most often as a chemical peel. It may reduce wrinkles, acne scarring, and hyperpigmentation and improve many other skin conditions, including actinic keratosis, hyperkeratosis, and seborrheic keratosis. Once applied, glycolic acid reacts with the upper layer of the epidermis, weakening the binding properties of the lipids that hold the dead skin cells together. This allows the outer skin to dissolve, revealing the underlying skin. It is thought that this is due to the reduction of calcium ion concentrations in the epidermis and the removal of calcium ions from cell adhesions, leading to desquamation. Glycolic acid is a known inhibitor of tyrosinase. This can suppress melanin formation and lead to a lightening of skin colour. Acute doses of glycolic acid on skin or eyes leads to local effects that are typical of a strong acid (e.g. dermal and eye irritation). Glycolate is a nephrotoxin if consumed orally. A nephrotoxin is a compound that causes damage to the kidney and kidney tissues. Glycolic acid's renal toxicity is due to its metabolism to oxalic acid. Glycolic and oxalic acid, along with excess lactic acid, are responsible for the anion gap metabolic acidosis. Oxalic acid readily precipitates with calcium to form insoluble calcium oxalate crystals. Renal tissue injury is caused by widespread deposition of oxalate crystals and the toxic effects of glycolic acid.

glycogen,,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Glycogen is a highly-branched polymer of about 30,000 glucose residues and has a molecular weight between 106 and 107 daltons (4.8 million approx.). Most of Glc units are linked by alpha-1,4 glycosidic bonds, approximately 1 in 12 Glc residues also makes -1,6 glycosidic bond with a second Glc which results in the creation of a branch. Glycogen only has one reducing end and a large number of non-reducing ends with a free hydroxyl group at carbon 4. The glycogen granules contain both glycogen and the enzymes of glycogen synthesis (glycogenesis) and degradation (glycogenolysis). The enzymes are nested between the outer branches of the glycogen molecules and act on the non-reducing ends. Therefore, the many non-reducing end-branches of glycogen facilitate its rapid synthesis and breakdown. In hypoglycemia caused by excessive insulin, liver glycogen levels are high, but the high insulin level prevents the glycogenolysis necessary to maintain normal blood sugar levels. Glucagon is a common treatment for this type of hypoglycemia. Glycogen is a polysaccharide that is the principal storage form of glucose (Glc) in animal and human cells. Glycogen is found in the form of granules in the cytosol in many cell types. Hepatocytes (liver cells) have the highest concentration of it - up to 8% of the fresh weight in well fed state, or 100 to 120 g in an adult - giving liver a distinctive, 'starchy taste'. In the muscles, glycogen is found in a much lower concentration (1% of the muscle mass), but the total amount exceeds that in liver. Small amounts of glycogen are found in the kidneys, and even smaller amounts in certain glial cells in the brain and white blood cells.",Glycogen,HMDB0000757,,,,,,,,,,

(http://www.dcnutrition.com/AminoAcids/) Nonketotic hyperglycinaemia (OMIM 606899) is an autosomal recessive condition caused by deficient enzyme activity of the glycine cleavage enzyme system (EC 2.1.1.10). The glycine cleavage enzyme system comprises four proteins: P-, T-, H- and L-proteins (EC 1.4.4.2, EC 2.1.2.10 and EC 1.8.1.4 for P-, T- and L-proteins). Mutations have been described in the GLDC (OMIM 238300), AMT (OMIM 238310), and GCSH (OMIM 238330) genes encoding the P-, T-, and H-proteins respectively. The glycine cleavage system catalyses the oxidative conversion of glycine into carbon dioxide and ammonia, with the remaining one-carbon unit transferred to folate as methylenetetrahydrofolate. It is the main catabolic pathway for glycine and it also contributes to one-carbon metabolism. Patients with a deficiency of this enzyme system have increased glycine in plasma, urine and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with an increased CSF: plasma glycine ratio.

Prolidase deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by chronic ulcerative dermatitis, mental retardation, frequent infections and massive urinary excretion of iminodipeptides. The disease has been confirmed to be due to hereditary prolidase deficiency. It has been reported that the activity of the enzyme against glycylproline (Gly-Pro) is almost totally deficient in patients with prolidase deficiency, whereas the activity against other substrates is not so deficient. Some patients with prolidase deficiency have a marked urinary excretion of the iminodipeptide Glycylproline.

glz,21187-98-4,31654,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Gliclazide is an oral antihyperglycemic agent used for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). It belongs to the sulfonylurea class of insulin secretagogues, which act by stimulating &beta; cells of the pancreas to release insulin. Sulfonylureas increase both basal insulin secretion and meal-stimulated insulin release. Medications in this class differ in their dose, rate of absorption, duration of action, route of elimination and binding site on their target pancreatic &beta; cell receptor. Sulfonylureas also increase peripheral glucose utilization, decrease hepatic gluconeogenesis and may increase the number and sensitivity of insulin receptors. Sulfonylureas are associated with weight gain, though less so than insulin. Due to their mechanism of action, sulfonylureas may cause hypoglycemia and require consistent food intake to decrease this risk. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased in elderly, debilitated and malnourished individuals. Gliclazide has been shown to decrease fasting plasma glucose, postprandial blood glucose and glycosolated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels (reflective of the last 8-10 weeks of glucose control). Gliclazide is extensively metabolized by the liver; its metabolites are excreted in both urine (60-70%) and feces (10-20%).",Gliclazide,HMDB0015252,,,D01599,,,,,1-(3-azabicyclo(3.3.0)Oct-3-yl)-3-(P-tolylsulfonyl)urea***1-(Hexahydrocyclopenta(c)pyrrol-2(1H)-yl)-3-(P-tolylsulfonyl)urea***Glimicron***1-(3-azabicyclo(3.3.0)Oct-3-yl)-3-(P-tolylsulphonyl)urea***1-(Hexahydrocyclopenta(c)pyrrol-2(1H)-yl)-3-(P-tolylsulphonyl)urea***N-(4-Methylbenzenesulfonyl)-n'-(3-azabicyclo(3.3.0)oct-3-yl)urea***Generics brand OF gliclazide***novo Gliclazide***novo-Gliclazide***Novopharm brand OF gliclazide***Diabrezide***Gen gliclazide***Servier brand OF gliclazide***Alphapharm brand OF gliclazide***Diaglyk***Diaikron***Diamicron***Gen-gliclazide***Gliclazide servier brand***Glyade***Glyclazide***Genpharm brand OF gliclazide***Gliklazid***Helsinn brand OF gliclazide,BOVGTQGAOIONJV-UHFFFAOYSA-N,

It is a component the cell plasma membrane which modulates cell signal transduction events. Gangliosides have been found to be highly important in immunology. Ganglioside GM2 carries a net-negative charge at pH 7.0 and is acidic. Gangliosides can amount to 6% of the weight of lipids from brain, but they are found at low levels in all animal tissues. G(M2) Ganglioside accumulates due to a deficiency of hexosaminidase A or B (beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase), or GM2 activator protein, resulting in Gangliosidoses. Gangliosidoses include heredity metabolic disorders that include Tay-Sachs disease and Sandhoff disease. Gangliosides GM2 is especially common in the nervous tissue of the brain.

gthrd,70-18-8,16856,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Glutathione is a compound synthesized from cysteine, perhaps the most important member of the body's toxic waste disposal team. Like cysteine, glutathione contains the crucial thiol (-SH) group that makes it an effective antioxidant. There are virtually no living organisms on this planet-animal or plant whose cells don't contain some glutathione. Scientists have speculated that glutathione was essential to the very development of life on earth. glutathione has many roles; in none does it act alone. It is a coenzyme in various enzymatic reactions. The most important of these are redox reactions, in which the thiol grouping on the cysteine portion of cell membranes protects against peroxidation; and conjugation reactions, in which glutathione (especially in the liver) binds with toxic chemicals in order to detoxify them. glutathione is also important in red and white blood cell formation and throughout the immune system. glutathione's clinical uses include the prevention of oxygen toxicity in hyperbaric oxygen therapy, treatment of lead and other heavy metal poisoning, lowering of the toxicity of chemotherapy and radiation in cancer treatments, and reversal of cataracts. (http://www.dcnutrition.com/AminoAcids/) glutathione participates in leukotriene synthesis and is a cofactor for the enzyme glutathione peroxidase. It is also important as a hydrophilic molecule that is added to lipophilic toxins and waste in the liver during biotransformation before they can become part of the bile. glutathione is also needed for the detoxification of methylglyoxal, a toxin produced as a by-product of metabolism. This detoxification reaction is carried out by the glyoxalase system. Glyoxalase I (EC 4.4.1.5) catalyzes the conversion of methylglyoxal and reduced glutathione to S-D-Lactoyl-glutathione. Glyoxalase II (EC 3.1.2.6) catalyzes the hydrolysis of S-D-Lactoyl-glutathione to glutathione and D-lactate. GSH is known as a substrate in both conjugation reactions and reduction reactions, catalyzed by glutathione S-transferase enzymes in cytosol, microsomes, and mitochondria. However, it is also capable of participating in non-enzymatic conjugation with some chemicals, as in the case of n-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), the reactive cytochrome P450-reactive metabolite formed by acetaminophen, that becomes toxic when GSH is depleted by an overdose (of acetaminophen). glutathione in this capacity binds to NAPQI as a suicide substrate and in the process detoxifies it, taking the place of cellular protein thiol groups which would otherwise be covalently modified; when all GSH has been spent, NAPQI begins to react with the cellular proteins, killing the cells in the process. The preferred treatment for an overdose of this painkiller is the administration (usually in atomized form) of N-acetylcysteine, which is used by cells to replace spent GSSG and renew the usable GSH pool.

gua,73-40-5,16235,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Guanine is one of the five main nucleobases found in the nucleic acids DNA and RNA. Guanine is a derivative of purine, consisting of a fused pyrimidine-imidazole ring system with conjugated double bonds. Being unsaturated, the bicyclic molecule is planar. The guanine nucleoside is called guanosine. The first isolation of guanine was reported in 1844 from the excreta of sea birds, known as guano, which was used as a source of fertilizer. High affinity binding of guanine nucleotides and the ability to hydrolyze bound GTP to GDP are characteristics of an extended family of intracellular proteins. Guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins may be involved in the activation of phospholipases C and A2 by hormones and other ligands. The binding of hormones to receptors that activate phospholipase C is decreased by guanine nucleotides and these hormones also stimulate a high-affinity GTPase activity in cell membranes. Effects of hormones on phospholipase C activity in cell-free preparations are dependent on the presence of guanine nucleotides. Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT, EC 2.4.2.8) is a purine salvage enzyme that catalyses the conversion of hypoxanthine and guanine to their respective mononucleotides. Partial deficiency of this enzyme can result in the overproduction of uric acid leading to a severe form of gout, whilst a virtual absence of HPRT activity causes the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, an inborn error of metabolism, which is characterised by hyperuricaemia, mental retardation, choreoathetosis and compulsive self-mutilation. Peroxynitrite induces DNA base damage predominantly at guanine (G) and 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) nucleobases via oxidation reactions. G and 8-oxoG are the most reactive bases toward Peroxynitrite and possibly the major contributors to peroxynitrite-derived genotoxic and mutagenic lesions.

Hydrogen is the most abundant of the chemical elements, constituting roughly 75% of the universe's elemental mass. Hydrogen can form compounds with most elements and is present in water and most organic compounds. It plays a particularly important role in acid-base chemistry, in which many reactions involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules. Oxidation of hydrogen, in the sense of removing its electron, formally gives H+, containing no electrons and a nucleus which is usually composed of one proton. That is why H+ is often called a proton. This species is central to discussion of acids. Under the Bronsted-Lowry theory, acids are proton donors, while bases are proton acceptors. A bare proton H+ cannot exist in solution because of its strong tendency to attach itself to atoms or molecules with electrons. However, the term 'proton' is used loosely to refer to positively charged or cationic hydrogen, denoted H+. H2 is a product of some types of anaerobic metabolism and is produced by several microorganisms, usually via reactions catalyzed by iron- or nickel-containing enzymes called hydrogenases.

h2o,7732-18-5,15377,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Water is a chemical substance that is essential to all known forms of life. It appears colorless to the naked eye in small quantities, though it is actually slightly blue in color. It covers 71% of Earth's surface. Current estimates suggest that there are 1.4 billion cubic kilometers (330 million m3) of it available on Earth, and it exists in many forms. It appears mostly in the oceans (saltwater) and polar ice caps, but it is also present as clouds, rain water, rivers, freshwater aquifers, lakes, and sea ice. Water in these bodies perpetually moves through a cycle of evaporation, precipitation, and runoff to the sea. Clean water is essential to human life. In many parts of the world, it is in short supply. From a biological standpoint, water has many distinct properties that are critical for the proliferation of life that set it apart from other substances. It carries out this role by allowing organic compounds to react in ways that ultimately allow replication. All known forms of life depend on water. Water is vital both as a solvent in which many of the body's solutes dissolve and as an essential part of many metabolic processes within the body. Metabolism is the sum total of anabolism and catabolism. In anabolism, water is removed from molecules (through energy requiring enzymatic chemical reactions) in order to grow larger molecules (e.g. starches, triglycerides and proteins for storage of fuels and information). In catabolism, water is used to break bonds in order to generate smaller molecules (e.g. glucose, fatty acids and amino acids to be used for fuels for energy use or other purposes). Water is thus essential and central to these metabolic processes. Water is also central to photosynthesis and respiration. Photosynthetic cells use the sun's energy to split off water's hydrogen from oxygen. Hydrogen is combined with CO2 (absorbed from air or water) to form glucose and release oxygen. All living cells use such fuels and oxidize the hydrogen and carbon to capture the sun's energy and reform water and CO2 in the process (cellular respiration). Water is also central to acid-base neutrality and enzyme function. An acid, a hydrogen ion (H+, that is, a proton) donor, can be neutralized by a base, a proton acceptor such as hydroxide ion (OH-) to form water. Water is considered to be neutral, with a pH (the negative log of the hydrogen ion concentration) of 7. Acids have pH values less than 7 while bases have values greater than 7. Stomach acid (HCl) is useful to digestion. However, its corrosive effect on the esophagus during reflux can temporarily be neutralized by ingestion of a base such as aluminum hydroxide to produce the neutral molecules water and the salt aluminum chloride. Human biochemistry that involves enzymes usually performs optimally around a biologically neutral pH of 7.4.

h2o2,7722-84-1,16240,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a very pale blue liquid which appears colourless in a dilute solution, slightly more viscous than water. It is a weak acid. It has strong oxidizing properties and is therefore a powerful bleaching agent that is mostly used for bleaching paper, but has also found use as a disinfectant and as an oxidizer. Hydrogen peroxide in the form of carbamide peroxide is widely used for tooth whitening (bleaching), both in professionally- and in self-administered products. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a well-documented component of living cells. It plays important roles in host defense and oxidative biosynthetic reactions. In addition there is growing evidence that at low levels, H2O2 also functions as a signaling agent, particularly in higher organisms. H2O2 has increasingly been viewed as an important cellular signaling agent in its own right, capable of modulating both contractile and growth-promoting pathways with more far-reaching effects. Due to the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide in the skin of patients with the depigmentation disorder vitiligo, the human epidermis cannot have the normal capacity for autocrine synthesis, transport and degradation of acetylcholine as well as the muscarinic (m1-m5) and nicotinic signal transduction in keratinocytes and melanocytes.

h2s,,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Hydrogen sulfide is a highly toxic and flammable gas. Because it is heavier than air it tends to accumulate at the bottom of poorly ventilated spaces. Although very pungent at first, it quickly deadens the sense of smell, so potential victims may be unaware of its presence until it is too late. H2S arises from virtually anywhere where elemental sulfur comes into contact with organic material, especially at high temperatures. Hydrogen sulfide is a covalent hydride chemically related to water (H2O) since oxygen and sulfur occur in the same periodic table group. It often results when bacteria break down organic matter in the absence of oxygen, such as in swamps, and sewers (alongside the process of anaerobic digestion). It also occurs in volcanic gases, natural gas and some well waters. It is also important to note that Hydrogen sulfide is a central participant in the sulfur cycle, the biogeochemical cycle of sulfur on Earth. As mentioned above, sulfur-reducing and sulfate-reducing bacteria derive energy from oxidizing hydrogen or organic molecules in the absence of oxygen by reducing sulfur or sulfate to hydrogen sulfide. Other bacteria liberate hydrogen sulfide from sulfur-containing amino acids. Several groups of bacteria can use hydrogen sulfide as fuel, oxidizing it to elemental sulfur or to sulfate by using oxygen or nitrate as oxidant. The purple sulfur bacteria and the green sulfur bacteria use hydrogen sulfide as electron donor in photosynthesis, thereby producing elemental sulfur. (In fact, this mode of photosynthesis is older than the mode of cyanobacteria, algae and plants which uses water as electron donor and liberates oxygen).",H2S,HMDB0003276,,,,,,,,,,

ha,9004-61-9,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Hyaluronic acid (HA), is the most abundant glycosaminoglycan (GAG) in mammalian tissue. It is present in high concentrations in connective tissue, such as skin, vitreous humor, cartilage, and umbilical cord, but the largest single reservoir is the synovial fluid (SF) of the diarthrodial joints, where concentrations of 0.5-4 mg/mL are achieved. Hyaluronic acid, is the major hydrodynamic nonprotein component of joint SF. Its unique viscoelastic properties confer remarkable shock absorbing and lubricating abilities to SF, while its enormous macromolecular size and hydrophilicity serve to retain fluid in the joint cavity during articulation. HA restricts the entry of large plasma proteins and cells into SF but facilitates solute exchange between the synovial capillaries and cartilage and other joint tissues. In addition, HA can form a pericellular coat around cells, interact with proinflammatory mediators, and bind to cell receptors, such as cluster determinant (CD)44 and receptor for hyaluronate-mediated motility (RHAMM), where it modulates cell proliferation, migration, and gene expression. All these physicochemical and biologic properties of HA have been shown to be molecular weight (MW) dependent. The diverse physicochemical properties of HA arise from its unique macromolecular structure. The HA is an exceptionally long (3-30 &#956;m) and unbranched nonsulfated GAG composed of repeating disaccharide units of N-acetylglucosamine, and glucuronic acid glycosidically linked through their respective 1-4 ring positions. Hydroxyl group oxygens at the glucuronyl-1 and glucosamine 3-positions are used for further polymerization of the HA disaccharide units to form chains that, when released from the cell plasma membrane, are of variable length and thus polydispersity.

HC00250,,16136,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Hydrogen sulfide is a highly toxic and flammable gas. Because it is heavier than air it tends to accumulate at the bottom of poorly ventilated spaces. Although very pungent at first, it quickly deadens the sense of smell, so potential victims may be unaware of its presence until it is too late. H2S arises from virtually anywhere where elemental sulfur comes into contact with organic material, especially at high temperatures. Hydrogen sulfide is a covalent hydride chemically related to water (H2O) since oxygen and sulfur occur in the same periodic table group. It often results when bacteria break down organic matter in the absence of oxygen, such as in swamps, and sewers (alongside the process of anaerobic digestion). It also occurs in volcanic gases, natural gas and some well waters. It is also important to note that Hydrogen sulfide is a central participant in the sulfur cycle, the biogeochemical cycle of sulfur on Earth. As mentioned above, sulfur-reducing and sulfate-reducing bacteria derive energy from oxidizing hydrogen or organic molecules in the absence of oxygen by reducing sulfur or sulfate to hydrogen sulfide. Other bacteria liberate hydrogen sulfide from sulfur-containing amino acids. Several groups of bacteria can use hydrogen sulfide as fuel, oxidizing it to elemental sulfur or to sulfate by using oxygen or nitrate as oxidant. The purple sulfur bacteria and the green sulfur bacteria use hydrogen sulfide as electron donor in photosynthesis, thereby producing elemental sulfur. (In fact, this mode of photosynthesis is older than the mode of cyanobacteria, algae and plants which uses water as electron donor and liberates oxygen).",Hydrogen sulfide,HMDB0003276,,,C00283,HS,FDB009599,HC00250,[S-][H],"[SH2]***Acide sulfhydrique***Dihydrogen monosulfide***Dihydrogen sulfide***H2S***Hydrogen monosulfide***Hydrogen sulphide***Hydrogen-sulfide***Hydrogene sulfure***HYDROsulfURIC ACID***Schwefelwasserstoff***Sulfide***Sulfure d'hydrogene***Acide sulphhydrique***Dihydrogen monosulphide***Dihydrogen sulphide***Hydrogen monosulphide***Hydrogen-sulphide***Hydrogene sulphure***HYDROsulfate***HYDROsulphate***HYDROsulphuric acid***Sulphide***Sulphure d'hydrogene***Dihydrogen disulfide***Hepatate***Hepatic acid***Hepatic gas***Hydrosulfurate***idrogeno Solforato***Sewer gas***Siarkowodor***Sour gas***Stink dAMP***Sulfur hydride***Sulfur hydroxide***Sulfureted hydrogen***Sulfuretted hydrogen***Zwavelwaterstof***Sulfide, hydrogen***Hydrogen sulfide (H2(SX))***Hydrogen sulfide (H2S2)***Hydrogen sulfide (H2S3)",RWSOTUBLDIXVET-UHFFFAOYSA-M,InChI=1S/H2S/h1H2/p-1

HC00900,516-05-2,30860,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Methylmalonic acid is a malonic acid derivative, which is a vital intermediate in the metabolism of fat and protein. In particular, the coenzyme A-linked form of methylmalonic acid, methylmalonyl-CoA, is converted into succinyl-CoA by methylmalonyl-CoA mutase in a reaction that requires vitamin B12 as a cofactor. In this way, methylmalonic acid enters the Krebs cycle and is thus part of one of the anaplerotic reactions. Abnormalities in methylmalonic acid metabolism lead to methylmalonic aciduria. This inborn error of metabolism is attributed to a block in the enzymatic conversion of methylmalonyl CoA to succinyl CoA. Methylmalonic acid is also found to be associated with other inborn errors of metabolism, including cobalamin deficiency, cobalamin malabsorption, malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency, and transcobalamin II deficiency. When present in sufficiently high levels, methylmalonic acid can act as an acidogen and a metabotoxin. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of methylmalonic acid are associated with at least 5 inborn errors of metabolism, including Malonyl CoA decarboxylase deficiency, Malonic Aciduria, Methylmalonate Semialdehyde Dehydrogenase Deficiency, Methylmalonic Aciduria and Methylmalonic Aciduria Due to Cobalamin-Related Disorders. Methylmalonic acid is an organic acid and abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart abnormalities, kidney abnormalities, liver damage, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of the untreated IEMs mentioned above. Many affected children with organic acidemias experience intellectual disability or delayed development. In adults, acidosis or acidemia is characterized by headaches, confusion, feeling tired, tremors, sleepiness, and seizures.",Methylmalonic acid,HMDB0000202,,,C02170,,FDB021905,HC00900,[H]C([H])([H])C([H])(C([O-])=O)C([O-])=O,"1,1-Ethanedicarboxylic acid***2-Methylmalonic acid***alpha-Methylmalonic acid***Isosuccinic acid***1,1-Ethanedicarboxylate***Methylmalonate***2-Methylmalonate***a-Methylmalonate***a-Methylmalonic acid***alpha-Methylmalonate***α-methylmalonate***α-methylmalonic acid***Isosuccinate***Methyl-malonate***Methyl-malonic acid***Methyl-propanedioate***Methyl-propanedioic acid***Methylpropanedioate***Methylpropanedioic acid***Acid, methylmalonic",ZIYVHBGGAOATLY-UHFFFAOYSA-L,"InChI=1S/C4H6O4/c1-2(3(5)6)4(7)8/h2H,1H3,(H,5,6)(H,7,8)/p-2"

Although humans are genetically deficient in producing Neu5Gc, small amounts are present in human cells and biofluids. Humans cannot synthesize Neu5Gc because the human gene CMAH is irreversibly mutated, though it is found in apes. This loss of the CMAH gene was estimated to have occurred two to three million years ago, just before the emergence of the genus Homo. A dietary origin of Neu5Gc was suggested by human volunteer studies. These trace amounts of Neu5Gc were determined to come from the consumption of animals in the human diet (i.e. red meats such as lamb, pork, and beef). Neu5Gc can also be found in dairy products, but to a lesser extent.

In order to aid the timely follow-up of screening results that suggest abnormalities in MCAD, rapid and simple confirmatory tests for the enzyme activity and/or gene mutation analysis should be available. Medium-chain fatty acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) catalyzes the conversion of different chain length fatty acyl- CoAs into their corresponding trans-enoyl-CoA moieties via two consecutive sequences of steps. The first step involves the concerted abstraction of a proton and a hydride ion from the a- and 8-carbon chains of the fatty acyl-CoA substrates, concomitant with the reduction of the enzyme (E)-bound FAD to FADH2. The reoxidation of EFADH2, to propagate further rounds of catalysis, is accomplished via transfer of electrons to a variety of organic electron acceptors; the natural electron acceptor for this process, under physiological conditions, is the electron-transferring flavoprotein. Of the different chain length fatty acyl-CoA substrates, octanoyl-CoA/octenoyl-CoA have been known as the most efficient (and physiological) substrates for the medium-chain fatty acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD)-catalyzed reaction.

Bile acids are steroid acids found predominantly in bile of mammals. The distinction between different bile acids is minute, depends only on presence or absence of hydroxyl groups on positions 3, 7, and 12. Bile acids are physiological detergents that facilitate excretion, absorption, and transport of fats and sterols in the intestine and liver. Bile acids are also steroidal amphipathic molecules derived from the catabolism of cholesterol. They modulate bile flow and lipid secretion, are essential for the absorption of dietary fats and vitamins, and have been implicated in the regulation of all the key enzymes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Bile acids recirculate through the liver, bile ducts, small intestine and portal vein to form an enterohepatic circuit. They exist as anions at physiological pH and, consequently, require a carrier for transport across the membranes of the enterohepatic tissues. The unique detergent properties of bile acids are essential for the digestion and intestinal absorption of hydrophobic nutrients. Bile acids have potent toxic properties (e.g., membrane disruption) and there are a plethora of mechanisms to limit their accumulation in blood and tissues.

HC01501,14383-50-7,16094,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Thiosulfate occurs naturally in hot springs and geysers, and is produced by certain biochemical processes. In the body, thiosulfate converts small amounts of cyanide ion into harmless products and plays a role in the biosynthesis of cysteine, a sulfur-containing amino acid that locks proteins into their correct three-dimensional shapes. Thiosulfate is not found in large quantities in nature. Solutions of thiosulfate break down into sulfur, sulfites, and sulfates when exposed to acids, light, metal ions, and bacteria. Thiosulfate is sometimes used as an antidote for cyanide poisoning. It reacts with cyanide to produce sulfite and thiocyanate ions: CN- + S2O32- SCN- + SO32- This reaction is catalyzed by an enzyme produced by cell mitochondria to neutralize small quantities of ingested cyanide (which occurs naturally in cassava root, lima beans, and almonds!). Thiosulfate is an intermediate in several biochemical pathways, including the synthesis of L-cysteine. Thiosulfate is manufactured by some cells by oxidation of elemental sulfur and by degradation of L-cysteine. Use: Photography (fixing agent to dissolve unchanged silver salts from exposed negatives), chrome tanning, removing chlorine in bleaching and papermaking, extraction of silver from its ores, dechlorination of water, mordant, reagent, bleaching, reducing agent in chrome dyeing, sequestrant in salt (up to 0.1%), antidote for cyanide poisoning. (Hawley's Condensed Chemical Dictionary) Source/Synthesis: Synthesis by dehydration of the pentahydrate at 105 degree. Alternatively formed by reaction of S2Cl2 with Na2O2 or by reduction of Na2S2O4 with sodium amalgam Use/Importance: Commercially available Biological Use/Importance: Cyanide antidote often administered with other antidotes, antifungal agent (ChemNetBase) Sodium thiosulfate is a common analytical reagent used in iodometric titration to analyze chlorine, bromine, and sulfide. Other uses are in bleaching paper pulp, bleaching straw, ivory, and bones, for removing chlorine from solutions, silver extraction from its ores, a mordant in dyeing and printing textiles, and as an antidote to cyanide poisoning. Another major application is in photography, where it is used as a fixer to dissolve unchanged silver salts from exposed negatives.

HC02024,604-33-1,41509,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Cholesteryl linoleic acid is a cholesteryl ester. A cholesteryl ester is an ester of cholesterol. Fatty acid esters of cholesterol constitute about two-thirds of the cholesterol in the plasma. Cholesterol is a sterol (a combination steroid and alcohol) and a lipid found in the cell membranes of all body tissues, and transported in the blood plasma of all animals. The accumulation of cholesterol esters in the arterial intima (the innermost layer of an artery, in direct contact with the flowing blood) is a characteristic feature of atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a disease affecting arterial blood vessels. It is a chronic inflammatory response in the walls of arteries, in large part to the deposition of lipoproteins (plasma proteins that carry cholesterol and triglycerides). Cholesteryl linoleate is contained in low density lipoprotein and atherosclerotic lesions. The oxidation products of cholesteryl linoleate may cause chronic inflammatory processes.

HC02086,7091-44-3,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): PA(16:0/16:0) is a phosphatidic acid. It is a glycerophospholipid in which a phosphate moiety occupies a glycerol substitution site. As is the case with diacylglycerols, phosphatidic acids can have many different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached at the C-1 and C-2 positions. Fatty acids containing 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. PA(16:0/16:0), in particular, consists of one chain of palmitic acid at the C-1 position and one chain of palmitic acid at the C-2 position. The palmitic acid moiety is derived from fish oils, milk fats, vegetable oils and animal fats, while the palmitic acid moiety is derived from fish oils, milk fats, vegetable oils and animal fats. Phosphatidic acids are quite rare but are extremely important as intermediates in the biosynthesis of triacylglycerols and phospholipids. Indeed, the concentration of phosphatidic acids is often over-estimated in tissues and biofluids as it can arise by inadvertent enzymatic hydrolysis during inappropriate storage or extraction conditions during analysis. The main biosynthetic route of phosphatidic acid in animal tissues involves sequential acylation of alpha-glycerophosphate by acyl-CoA derivatives of fatty acids. PAs are biologically active lipids that can stimulate a large range of responses in many different cell types, such as platelet aggregation, smooth muscle contraction, in vivo vasoactive effects, chemotaxis, expression of adhesion molecules, increased tight junction permeability of endothelial cells, induction of stress fibres, modulation of cardiac contractility, and many others. Diacylglycerols (DAGs) can be converted to PAs by DAG kinases and indirect evidence supports the notion that PAs alter the excitability of neurons. Phospholipase Ds (PLDs), which catalyze the conversion of glycerolphospholipids, particularly phosphatidylcholine, to PAs and the conversion of N-arachidonoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE) to anandamide and PAs are activated by several inflammatory mediators including bradykinin, ATP and glutamate. PAs activate downstream signaling pathways such as PKCs and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), which are linked to an increase in sensitivity of sensory neurons either during inflammation or in chronic pain models. Circumstantial evidence that PAs are converted to DAGs.

HC02111,56-65-5,15422,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a nucleotide consisting of a purine base (adenine) attached to the first carbon atom of ribose (a pentose sugar). Three phosphate groups are esterified at the fifth carbon atom of the ribose. ATP is incorporated into nucleic acids by polymerases in the processes of DNA replication and transcription. ATP contributes to cellular energy charge and participates in overall energy balance, maintaining cellular homeostasis. ATP can act as an extracellular signaling molecule via interactions with specific purinergic receptors to mediate a wide variety of processes as diverse as neurotransmission, inflammation, apoptosis, and bone remodelling. Extracellular ATP and its metabolite adenosine have also been shown to exert a variety of effects on nearly every cell type in human skin, and ATP seems to play a direct role in triggering skin inflammatory, regenerative, and fibrotic responses to mechanical injury, an indirect role in melanocyte proliferation and apoptosis, and a complex role in Langerhans cell-directed adaptive immunity. During exercise, intracellular homeostasis depends on the matching of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) supply and ATP demand. Metabolites play a useful role in communicating the extent of ATP demand to the metabolic supply pathways. Effects as different as proliferation or differentiation, chemotaxis, release of cytokines or lysosomal constituents, and generation of reactive oxygen or nitrogen species are elicited upon stimulation of blood cells with extracellular ATP. The increased concentration of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in erythrocytes from patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) has been observed in many studies but the mechanism leading to these abnormalities still is controversial.

Riboflavin is phosphorylated by ATP to give riboflavin 5-phosphate (FMN). FAD is then formed from FMN by the transfer of an AMP moiety from a second molecule of ATP. FADH is generated in each round of fatty acid oxidation, and the fatty acyl chain is shortened by two carbon atoms as a result of these reactions; because oxidation is on the beta carbon, this series of reactions is called the beta-oxidation pathway. In the citric acid cycle FADH is involved in harvesting of high-energy electrons from carbon fuels; citric acid cycle itself neither generates a large amount of ATP nor includes oxygen as a reactant. Instead, the citric acid cycle removes electrons from acetyl CoA and uses these electrons to form FADH. (Biochemistry. Berg, Jeremy M. Tymoczko, John L. and Stryer, Lubert. New York: W. H.

It is a component the cell plasma membrane which modulates cell signal transduction events. Gangliosides have been found to be highly important in immunology. Ganglioside GM2 carries a net-negative charge at pH 7.0 and is acidic. Gangliosides can amount to 6% of the weight of lipids from brain, but they are found at low levels in all animal tissues. G(M2) Ganglioside accumulates due to a deficiency of hexosaminidase A or B (beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase), or GM2 activator protein, resulting in Gangliosidoses. Gangliosidoses include heredity metabolic disorders that include Tay-Sachs disease and Sandhoff disease. Gangliosides GM2 is especially common in the nervous tissue of the brain. In the United States, about 1 in 27 to 1 in 30 Ashkenazi Jews is a recessive carrier. French Canadians and the Cajun community of Louisiana have an occurrence similar to the Ashkenazi Jews.Gangliosides are glycosphingolipids. There are four types of glycosphingolipids, the cerebrosides, sulfatides, globosides and gangliosides. Gangliosides are very similar to globosides except that they also contain N-acetyl neuraminic acid (NANA) in varying amounts. The specific names for the gangliosides provide information about their structure. The letter G refers to ganglioside, and the subscripts M, D, T and Q indicate that the molecule contains mono-, di-, tri and quatra-sialic acid. The numbered subscripts 1, 2 and 3 refer to the carbohydrate sequence that is attached to the ceramide. In particular, 1 stands for GalGalNAcGalGlc-ceramide, 2 stands for GalNAcGalGlc-ceramide and 3 stands for GalGlc-ceramide. Deficiencies in lysosomal enzymes that degrade the carbohydrate portions of various gangliosides are responsible for a number of lysosomal storage diseases such as Tay-Sachs disease, Sandhoff disease, and GM1 gangliosidosis.

HC02191,434-13-9,16325,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Lithocholic acid, also known as 3α-hydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oic acid or LCA, is a secondary bile acid. It is formed from chenodeoxycholate by bacterial action, and is usually conjugated with glycine or taurine. It acts as a detergent to solubilize fats for absorption and is itself absorbed. It is used as cholagogue and choleretic. Bile acids are steroid acids found predominantly in the bile of mammals. The distinction between different bile acids is minute, and depends only on the presence or absence of hydroxyl groups on positions 3, 7, and 12. Bile acids are physiological detergents that facilitate excretion, absorption, and transport of fats and sterols in the intestine and liver. Bile acids are also steroidal amphipathic molecules derived from the catabolism of cholesterol. They modulate bile flow and lipid secretion, are essential for the absorption of dietary fats and vitamins, and have been implicated in the regulation of all the key enzymes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Bile acids recirculate through the liver, bile ducts, small intestine, and portal vein to form an enterohepatic circuit. They exist as anions at physiological pH, and consequently require a carrier for transport across the membranes of the enterohepatic tissues. The unique detergent properties of bile acids are essential for the digestion and intestinal absorption of hydrophobic nutrients. Bile acids have potent toxic properties (e.g. membrane disruption) and there are a plethora of mechanisms to limit their accumulation in blood and tissues (PMID: 11316487, 16037564, 12576301, 11907135). When present in sufficiently high levels, lithocholic acid can act as an oncometabolite. An oncometabolite is a compound that when present at chronically high levels promotes tumour growth and survival. Chronically high levels of lithocholic acid are associated with several forms of cancer including colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, esophageal cancer, and many other GI cancers. High bile acid levels lead to the generation of reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species, disruption of the cell membrane and mitochondria, induction of DNA damage, mutation and apoptosis, and the development of reduced apoptosis capability upon chronic exposure (PMID: 24884764). Dietary fibre can bind to lithocholic acid and aid in its excretion in stool.

HC02192,516-90-5,36259,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Lithocholyltaurine is a bile salt formed in the liver from lithocholic acid conjugation with taurine, usually as the sodium salt. It solubilizes fats for absorption and is itself absorbed. Lithocholic acid, a hydrophobic secondary bile acid, is well known to cause intrahepatic cholestasis. There have been extensive studies on the mechanisms of lithocholate-induced cholestasis in animals. Lithocholate diminishes both the bile acid-dependent and independent bile flow. In humans, elevated levels of lithocholic acid are found in patients with chronic cholestatic liver disease. Lithocholyltaurine impairs both the bile canalicular contractions and the canalicular bile secretion, possibly by acting directly on the canalicular membranes in lithocholyltaurine-induced cholestasis. Lithocholyltaurine induce acute cholestasis-associated with retrieval of the bile salt export pump. The bile salt export pump (BSEP) of hepatocyte secretes conjugated bile salts across the canalicular membrane in an ATP-dependent manner. Hepatic retention of bile acids may lead to liver injury by hepatocyte apoptosis and eventually deterioration of cholestatic liver diseases. One mechanism of induced apoptosis by lithocholyltaurine is the induction of transcriptional activity of AP-1 (activation protein-1).

HC02204,13345-51-2,27624,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Prostaglandin B1 (PGB1) is a metabolite of PGE1. PGE1 is a prostanoid. Prostanoids is a term that collectively describes prostaglandins, prostacyclines and thromboxanes. Prostanoids are a subclass of the lipid mediator group known as eicosanoids. They derive from C-20 polyunsaturated fatty acids, mainly dihomo-gamma-linoleic (20:3n-6), arachidonic (20:4n-6), and eicosapentaenoic (20:5n-3) acids, through the action of cyclooxygenases-1 and -2 (COX-1 and COX-2). PGB1does not inhibit phospholipase activity, but oligomers of PGB1 (PGBx) extracted from human neutrophils inhibit human phospholipases A2 in vitro and in situ in a dose-dependent manner; these oligomers inhibit arachidonic acid mobilization in human neutrophils and endothelial cells. One mechanism for the pharmacological effects of PGBx may be inhibition of cell-associated and extracellular phospholipase A2. PGB1 has the ability to enhance peripheral vascular resistance and elevate blood pressure. The effect is not central in origin and apparently is not the result of changes in cholinergic or alpha-adrenoceptor sensitivity or changes in vascular smooth muscle susceptibility per se. PGB1 blocks S-phase DNA synthesis; inhibition of DNA synthesis does not appear to require elevated levels of cAMP. (PMID: 7667505, 1477202, 2129000, 2597672, 6635328). Prostaglandins are eicosanoids.

HC02216,4510-16-1,28922,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Prostaglandin F2b is a naturally occurring isoprostane. Isoprostanes are arachidonic acid metabolites produced by peroxidative attack of membrane lipids. These accumulate to substantial levels in many clinical conditions characterized in part by accumulation of free radicals and reactive oxygen species, including asthma, hypertension and ischemia-reperfusion injury. For this reason, they are frequently used as markers of oxidative stress; however, many are now finding that these molecules are not inert, but in fact evoke powerful biological responses in an increasing array of cell types. In many cases, these biological effects can account in part for the various features and manifestations of those clinical conditions. Thus, it may be possible that the isoprostanes are playing somewhat of a causal role in those disease states. Lipid-peroxidation forms primary- or secondary-end products like conjugated dienes, lipid hydroperoxides, gaseous alkanes, and prostaglandin F2-like products. They are created as major products by free-radical catalyzed peroxidation of esterified arachidonic acid (AA) in membrane phospholipids. They are also minor products of the activity of platelet cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) in response to stimuli such as collagen, thrombin, or arachidonate. The levels of Prostaglandin F2b and F2-isoprostanes in CSF and urine are elevated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients when compared to that of age-matched controls.

HC02217,51982-36-6,27647,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Prostaglandin G2 (PGG2) is synthesized from arachidonic acid on a cyclooxygenase (COX) metabolic pathway as a primary step; the COX biosynthesis of prostaglandin (PG) begins with the highly specific oxygenation of arachidonic acid in the 11R configuration and ends with a 15S oxygenation to form PGG2. The COX site activity that catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to PGG2 is the target for nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The peroxidase site activity catalyzes the two-electron reduction of the hydroperoxide bond of PGG2 to yield the corresponding alcohol prostaglandin H2 (PGH2). The formation of a phenoxyl radical on Tyr385 couples the activities of the two sites. The Tyr385 radical is produced via oxidation by compound I, an oxoferryl porphyrin -cation radical, which is generated by reaction of the hemin resting state with PGG2 or other hydroperoxides. The tyrosyl radical homolytically abstracts the 13proS hydrogen atom of arachidonic acid which initiates a radical cascade that ends with the stereoselective formation of PGG2. PGG2 then migrates from the cyclooxygenase (COX) site to the peroxidase (POX) site where it reacts with the hemin group to generate PGH2 and compound I. The heterolytic oxygen-oxygen bond cleavage is assisted by the conserved distal residues His207 and Gln203, mutation of which has been shown to severely impair enzyme activity. Compound I, upon reaction with Tyr385, gives compound II, which in turn is reduced to the hemin resting state by one-electron oxidation of reducing cosubstrates or undergoes reactions that result in enzyme self-inactivation. Prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase (PGHS) 1 is a bifunctional membrane enzyme of the endoplasmic reticulum that converts arachidonic acid into prostaglandin H2 (PGH2), the precursor of all prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and prostacyclins. These lipid mediators are intricately involved in normal physiology, namely, in mitogenesis, fever generation, pain response, lymphocyte chemotaxis, fertility, and contradictory stimuli such as vasoconstriction and vasodilatation, as well as platelet aggregation and quiescence. PGHS is implicated in numerous pathologies, including inflammation, cancers of the colon, lung, and breast, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and numerous cardiovascular diseases including atherosclerosis, thrombosis, myocardial infarction, and stroke.

hco3,71-52-3,17544,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Bicarbonate, or hydrogen carbonate, is a simple single carbon molecule that plays surprisingly important roles in diverse biological processes. Among these are photosynthesis, the Krebs cycle, whole-body and cellular pH regulation, and volume regulation. Since bicarbonate is charged it is not permeable to lipid bilayers. Mammalian membranes thus contain bicarbonate transport proteins to facilitate the specific transmembrane movement of HCO3(-). Bicarbonate ion is an anion that consists of one central carbon atom surrounded by three oxygen atoms in a trigonal planar arrangement, with a hydrogen atom attached to one of the oxygens. The bicarbonate ion carries a negative one formal charge and is the conjugate base of carbonic acid, H2CO3. The carbonate radical is an elusive and strong one-electron oxidant. Bicarbonate in equilibrium with carbon dioxide constitutes the main physiological buffer. The bicarbonate-carbon dioxide pair stimulates the oxidation, peroxidation and nitration of several biological targets. The demonstration that the carbonate radical existed as an independent species in aqueous solutions at physiological pH and temperature renewed the interest in the pathophysiological roles of this radical and related species. The carbonate radical has been proposed to be a key mediator of the oxidative damage resulting from peroxynitrite production, xanthine oxidase turnover and superoxide dismutase1 peroxidase activity. The carbonate radical has also been proposed to be responsible for the stimulatory effects of the bicarbonate-carbon dioxide pair on oxidations mediated by hydrogen peroxide/transition metal ions. The ultimate precursor of the carbonate radical anion being bicarbonate, carbon dioxide, peroxymonocarbonate or complexes of transition metal ions with bicarbonate-derived species remains a matter of debate. The carbonate radical mediates some of the pathogenic effects of peroxynitrite. The carbonate radical as the oxidant produced from superoxide dismutase (EC 1.15.1.1, SOD1) peroxidase activity. Peroxymonocarbonate is a biological oxidant, whose existence is in equilibrium with hydrogen peroxide and bicarbonate (PMID: 17505962, 17215880).

hcys_L,454-29-5,17230,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Homocysteine is a sulfur-containing amino acid that arises during methionine metabolism. Although its concentration in plasma is only about 10 micromolar (uM), even moderate hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with increased incidence of cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer's disease. Elevations in plasma homocysteine are commonly found as a result of vitamin deficiencies, polymorphisms of enzymes of methionine metabolism, and renal disease. Pyridoxal, folic acid, riboflavin, and Vitamin B(12) are all required for methionine metabolism, and deficiency of each of these vitamins result in elevated plasma homocysteine. A polymorphism of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (C677T), which is quite common in most populations with a homozygosity rate of 10-15 %, is associated with moderate hyperhomocysteinemia, especially in the context of marginal folate intake. Plasma homocysteine is inversely related to plasma creatinine in patients with renal disease. This is due to an impairment in homocysteine removal in renal disease. The role of these factors, and of modifiable lifestyle factors, in affecting methionine metabolism and in determining plasma homocysteine levels is discussed. Homocysteine is an independent cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor modifiable by nutrition and possibly exercise. Homocysteine was first identified as an important biological compound in 1932 and linked with human disease in 1962 when elevated urinary homocysteine levels were found in children with mental retardation. This condition, called homocysteinuria, was later associated with premature occlusive CVD, even in children. These observations led to research investigating the relationship of elevated homocysteine levels and CVD in a wide variety of populations including middle age and elderly men and women with and without traditional risk factors for CVD (PMID 17136938, 15630149).

hgentis,451-13-8,44747,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Homogentisic acid, also known as melanic acid, is an intermediate in the breakdown or catabolism of tyrosine and phenylalanine. It is generated from the compound p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate through the enzyme p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dehydrogenase. The resulting homogentisic acid is then broken down into 4-maleylacetoacetate via the enzyme homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase. Homogentisic acid is also found in other organisms. For instance, it can found in Arbutus unedo (strawberry-tree) honey, in the bacterial plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris as well as in the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica where it is associated with the production of brown pigments. Homogentisic acid can be oxidatively dimerized to form hipposudoric acid, one of the main constituents of the 'blood sweat' of hippopotamuses. When present in sufficiently high levels, homogentisic acid can function as an osteotoxin and a renal toxin. An osteotoxin is a substance that causes damage to bones and/or joints. A renal toxin causes damage to the kidneys. Chronically high levels of homogentisic acid are associated with alkaptonuria (OMIM: 203500), an inborn error of metabolism. Alkaptonuria is a rare inherited genetic disorder in which the body cannot process the amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine. It is caused by a mutation in the enzyme homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.5), which leads to an accumulation of homogentisic acid in the blood and tissues. Homogentisic acid and its oxidized form benzoquinone acetic acid are excreted in the urine, giving it an unusually dark color. The accumulating homogentisic acid (and benzoquinone acetic acid) causes damage to cartilage (ochronosis, leading to osteoarthritis) and heart valves as well as precipitating as kidney stones and stones in other organs. More specifically, homogentisic acid can be converted to benzoquinone acetic acid (BQA), and the resulting BQA can be readily converted to polymers that resemble the dark skin pigment melanin. These polymers are deposited in the collagen, a connective tissue protein, of particular tissues such as cartilage. This process is called ochronosis (as the tissue looks ochre); ochronotic tissue is stiffened and unusually brittle, impairing its normal function and causing damage.

his_L,71-00-1,15971,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Histidine is an alpha-amino acid with an imidazole functional group. It is one of the 22 proteinogenic amino acids. Histidine was first isolated by German physician Albrecht Kossel in 1896. Histidine is an essential amino acid in humans and other mammals. It was initially thought that it was only essential for infants, but longer-term studies established that it is also essential for adults. Infants four to six months old require 33 mg/kg of histidine. It is not clear how adults make small amounts of histidine, and dietary sources probably account for most of the histidine in the body. Histidine is a precursor for histamine and carnosine biosynthesis. Inborn errors of histidine metabolism, including histidinemia, maple syrup urine disease, propionic acidemia, and tyrosinemia I, exist and are marked by increased histidine levels in the blood. Elevated blood histidine is accompanied by a wide range of symptoms, from mental and physical retardation to poor intellectual functioning, emotional instability, tremor, ataxia and psychosis. Histidine and other imidazole compounds have anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-secretory properties (PMID: 9605177). The efficacy of L-histidine in protecting inflamed tissue is attributed to the capacity of the imidazole ring to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by cells during acute inflammatory response (PMID: 9605177). Histidine, when administered in therapeutic quantities is able to inhibit cytokines and growth factors involved in cell and tissue damage (US patent 6150392). Histidine in medical therapies has its most promising trials in rheumatoid arthritis where up to 4.5 g daily have been used effectively in severely affected patients. Arthritis patients have been found to have low serum histidine levels, apparently because of very rapid removal of histidine from their blood (PMID: 1079527). Other patients besides arthritis patients that have been found to be low in serum histidine are those with chronic renal failure. Urinary levels of histidine are reduced in pediatric patients with pneumonia (PMID: 2084459). Asthma patients exhibit increased serum levels of histidine over normal controls (PMID: 23517038).  Serum histidine levels are lower and are negatively associated with inflammation and oxidative stress in obese women (PMID: 23361591).  Histidine supplementation has been shown to reduce insulin resistance, reduce BMI and fat mass and suppress inflammation and oxidative stress in obese women with metabolic syndrome.  Histidine appears to suppress pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, possibly via the NF-κB pathway, in adipocytes (PMID: 23361591). Low plasma concentrations of histidine are associated with protein-energy wasting, inflammation, oxidative stress, and greater mortality in chronic kidney disease patients (PMID: 18541578). Histidine may have many other possible functions because it is the precursor of the ubiquitous neurohormone-neurotransmitter histamine. Histidine increases histamine in the blood and probably in the brain. Low blood histamine with low serum histidine occurs in rheumatoid arthritis patients. Low blood histamine also occurs in some manic, schizophrenic, high copper and hyperactive groups of psychiatric patients. Histidine is a useful therapy in all patients with low histamine levels (http://www.dcnutrition.com ).",L-Histidine,HMDB0000177,,,C00135,HIS,FDB011856,his_L,[H]N1C([H])=NC(=C1[H])C([H])([H])[C@@]([H])(C([O-])=O)[N+]([H])([H])[H],"(S)-4-(2-amino-2-Carboxyethyl)imidazole***(S)-alpha-amino-1H-Imidazole-4-propanoic acid***(S)-alpha-amino-1H-Imidazole-4-propionic acid***H***His***HISTIDINE***L-(-)-Histidine***L-Histidin***(S)-a-amino-1H-Imidazole-4-propanoate***(S)-a-amino-1H-Imidazole-4-propanoic acid***(S)-alpha-amino-1H-Imidazole-4-propanoate***(S)-α-amino-1H-imidazole-4-propanoate***(S)-α-amino-1H-imidazole-4-propanoic acid***(S)-a-amino-1H-Imidazole-4-propionate***(S)-a-amino-1H-Imidazole-4-propionic acid***(S)-alpha-amino-1H-Imidazole-4-propionate***(S)-α-amino-1H-imidazole-4-propionate***(S)-α-amino-1H-imidazole-4-propionic acid***(S)-1H-Imidazole-4-alanine***(S)-2-amino-3-(4-Imidazolyl)propionsaeure***(S)-Histidine***(S)1H-Imidazole-4-alanine***3-(1H-Imidazol-4-yl)-L-alanine***amino-1H-Imidazole-4-propanoate***amino-1H-Imidazole-4-propanoic acid***amino-4-Imidazoleproprionate***amino-4-Imidazoleproprionic acid***Glyoxaline-5-alanine***Histidine, L isomer***Histidine, L-isomer***L-Isomer histidine",HNDVDQJCIGZPNO-YFKPBYRVSA-N,"InChI=1S/C6H9N3O2/c7-5(6(10)11)1-4-2-8-3-9-4/h2-3,5H,1,7H2,(H,8,9)(H,10,11)/t5-/m0/s1"

HMG-CoA reductase (EC 1.1.1.34) inhibitors, more commonly known as statins, are cholesterol-lowering drugs that have been widely used for many years to reduce the incidence of adverse cardiovascular events.

hpdcacrn,106182-29-0,131887,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Heptadecanoyl carnitine is an acylcarnitine. Numerous disorders have been described that lead to disturbances in energy production and in intermediary metabolism in the organism which are characterized by the production and excretion of unusual acylcarnitines. A mutation in the gene coding for carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase or the OCTN2 transporter aetiologically causes a carnitine deficiency that results in poor intestinal absorption of dietary L-carnitine, its impaired reabsorption by the kidney and, consequently, in increased urinary loss of L-carnitine. Determination of the qualitative pattern of acylcarnitines can be of diagnostic and therapeutic importance. The betaine structure of carnitine requires special analytical procedures for recording. The ionic nature of L-carnitine causes a high water solubility which decreases with increasing chain length of the ester group in the acylcarnitines. Therefore, the distribution of L-carnitine and acylcarnitines in various organs is defined by their function and their physico-chemical properties as well. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) permits screening for free and total carnitine, as well as complete quantitative acylcarnitine determination, including the long-chain acylcarnitine profile.

Hydroquinone is a white granular solid at room temperature and pressure. The hydroxyl groups of hydroquinone are quite weakly acidic. Hydroquinone can lose an H+ from one of the hydroxyls to form a monophenolate ion or lose an H+ from both to form a diphenolate ion.

hx2coa,10018-93-6,28706,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): trans-Hexenoyl-CoA is an intermediate in fatty acid metabolism. Beta-oxidation occurs in both mitochondria and peroxisomes. Mitochondria catalyze the beta-oxidation of the bulk of short-, medium-, and long-chain fatty acids derived from diet, and this pathway constitutes the major process by which fatty acids are oxidized to generate energy. Peroxisomes are involved in the beta-oxidation chain shortening of long-chain and very-long-chain fatty acyl-coenzyme (CoAs), long-chain dicarboxylyl-CoAs, the CoA esters of eicosanoids, 2-methyl-branched fatty acyl-CoAs, and the CoA esters of the bile acid intermediates di- and trihydroxycoprostanoic acids, and in the process they generate H2O2. Long-chain and very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) are also metabolized by the cytochrome P450 CYP4A omega-oxidation system to dicarboxylic acids that serve as substrates for peroxisomal beta-oxidation. The peroxisomal beta-oxidation system consists of (a) a classical peroxisome proliferator-inducible pathway capable of catalyzing straight-chain acyl-CoAs by fatty acyl-CoA oxidase, L-bifunctional protein, and thiolase, and (b) a second noninducible pathway catalyzing the oxidation of 2-methyl-branched fatty acyl-CoAs by branched-chain acyl-CoA oxidase (pristanoyl-CoA oxidase/trihydroxycoprostanoyl-CoA oxidase), D-bifunctional protein, and sterol carrier protein (SCP)x.  trans-Hexenoyl-CoA is the substrate of the enzymes enoyl-coenzyme A reductase, acyl-CoA oxidase [EC 1.3.99.2-1.3.3.6], acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, long-chain-acyl-CoA dehydrogenase [EC 1.3.99.3-1.3.99.13], and Oxidoreductases [EC 1.3.99.-]; trans-Hexenoyl-CoA is an intermediate in fatty acid elongation in mitochondria, being the substrate of the enzymes enoyl-CoA hydratase and long-chain-enoyl-CoA hydratase [EC 4.2.1.17-4.2.1.74].

Among mediators of oxidative stress, highly reactive secondary aldehydic lipid peroxidation products can initiate the processes of spontaneous mutagenesis and carcinogenesis and can also act as a growth-regulating factors and signaling molecules. In specimens obtained from adult patients with brain astrocytomas, lower levels of n-hexanal are associated with poorer patient prognosis. Hexanal is a volatile compound that has been associated with the development of undesirable flavours. The content of hexanal, which is a major breakdown product of linoleic acid (LA, n - 6 PUFA) oxidation, has been used to follow the course of lipid oxidation and off-flavour development in foods, and have been proposed as one potential marker of milk quality. A ""cardboard-like"" off-flavour is frequently associated with dehydrated milk products. This effect is highly correlated with the headspace concentration of hexanal. (Food Chemistry.

The distinction between different bile acids is minute, depends only on presence or absence of hydroxyl groups on positions 3, 7, and 12. Bile acids are physiological detergents that facilitate excretion, absorption, and transport of fats and sterols in the intestine and liver. Bile acids are also steroidal amphipathic molecules derived from the catabolism of cholesterol. They modulate bile flow and lipid secretion, are essential for the absorption of dietary fats and vitamins, and have been implicated in the regulation of all the key enzymes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Bile acids recirculate through the liver, bile ducts, small intestine and portal vein to form an enterohepatic circuit. They exist as anions at physiological pH and, consequently, require a carrier for transport across the membranes of the enterohepatic tissues. The unique detergent properties of bile acids are essential for the digestion and intestinal absorption of hydrophobic nutrients. Bile acids have potent toxic properties (e.g., membrane disruption) and there are a plethora of mechanisms to limit their accumulation in blood and tissues.

i,20461-54-5,16382,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Iodide can function as an antioxidant as it is a reducing species that can detoxify reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide. Over three billion years ago, blue-green algae were the most primitive oxygenic photosynthetic organisms and are the ancestors of multicellular eukaryotic algae (1). Algae that contain the highest amount of iodine (1-3 % of dry weight) and peroxidase enzymes, were the first living cells to produce poisonous oxygen in the atmosphere. Therefore algal cells required a protective antioxidant action of their molecular components, in which iodides, through peroxidase enzymes, seem to have had this specific role. In fact, iodides are greatly present and available in the sea, where algal phytoplankton, the basis of marine food-chain, acts as a biological accumulator of iodides, selenium, (and n-3 fatty acids) :; Antioxidant biochemical mechanism of iodides, probably one of the most ancient mechanisms of defense from poisonous reactive oxygen species:; An iodide ion is an iodine atom with a -1 charge. Compounds with iodine in formal oxidation state -1 are called iodides. This can include ionic compounds such as caesium iodide or covalent compounds such as phosphorus triiodide. This is the same naming scheme as is seen with chlorides and bromides. The chemical test for an iodide compound is to acidify the aqueous compound by adding some drops of acid, to dispel any carbonate ions present, then adding lead(II) nitrate, yielding a bright yellow precipitate of lead iodide. Most ionic iodides are soluble, with the exception of yellow silver iodide and yellow lead iodide. Aqueous solutions of iodide dissolve iodine better than pure water due to the formation of complex ions:.",Iodide,HMDB0012238,,,C00708,CPD-387,FDB028881,i,[I-],I(-)***IODIDE ion***Iodine anion***Iodide anion***Iodide salt***Iodide(1-)***Iodinane***Iodine ion***Lambda(3)-iodane***Trihydridoiodine,XMBWDFGMSWQBCA-UHFFFAOYSA-M,InChI=1S/HI/h1H/p-1

idour,3402-98-0,24769,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Iduronic acid is a constituent of glycosaminoglycans heparin and heparan sulfate in varying proportions providing considerable diversity in sequence and biological function. The glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are linear polysaccharides with alternating uronic acids (Iduronic acid and Glucuronic acid) and hexosamine residues, in which a limited set of monosaccharide units gives rise to a number of complex sequences by variable substitution with O-sulfate, N-sulfate, and N-acetyl groups. GAGs usually exist as the O-linked side-chains of proteoglycans, displaying a set of physiological functions which is remarkably wide and as yet incompletely explored. They may act as structural components of connective tissue and the extracellular matrix, or as specific ligands in the relationship between the cell surface and its surroundings. Heparan sulfate exists on the surface of most or all mammalian cells and can display a remarkable range of different sequence motifs; its range of interactions and possible functions reflect its structural complexity. The main repeat unit of heparin structurally resembles the protein binding sequences in heparan sulfate, but contains a higher percentage of sulfated residues. Utilized therapeutically as an anticoagulant and readily available in good quantities heparin serves as a useful model for heparan sulfate. Theoretical and experimental studies indicate that L-Iduronic acid residues of glycosaminoglycans are in equilibrium of different conformations, the relative proportion of conformers being a function of sulfation pattern and sequence. This unique conformational flexibility may provide an explanation for the stronger binding and associated higher biological activities of Iduronic acid-containing glycosaminoglycans (such as heparin, heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate) as compared with other GAGs having similar charge density but with the more rigid glucuronic acid as the major uronic acid residue. Dermatan sulfates and heparins, which contain L-Iduronic acid in their backbone, show higher low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-affinity than chondroitin sulfates, which contain only D-glucuronic acid. Though confirming a non-specific, predominantly electrostatic interaction between GAGs and LDL, these results indicate modulation of LDL affinity by the polysaccharide backbone. Naturally oversulfated dermatan sulfate (SO3H/COOH ca. 1.2), mainly oversulfated at C-2 of Iduronic acid residues, show comparatively higher anticoagulant activity.

ile_L,73-32-5,17191,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Branched chain amino acids (BCAA) are essential amino acids whose carbon structure is marked by a branch point. These three amino acids are critical to human life and are particularly involved in stress, energy and muscle metabolism. BCAA supplementation as therapy, both oral and intravenous, in human health and disease holds great promise. ""BCAA"" denotes valine, isoleucine and leucine which are branched chain essential amino acids. Despite their structural similarities, the branched amino acids have different metabolic routes, with valine going solely to carbohydrates, leucine solely to fats and isoleucine to both. The different metabolism accounts for different requirements for these essential amino acids in humans: 12 mg/kg, 14 mg/kg and 16 mg/kg of valine, leucine and isoleucine respectively. Furthermore, these amino acids have different deficiency symptoms. Valine deficiency is marked by neurological defects in the brain, while isoleucine deficiency is marked by muscle tremors. BCAA are decreased in patients with liver disease, such as hepatitis, hepatic coma, cirrhosis, extrahepatic biliary atresia or portacaval shunt; aromatic amino acids (AAA)-tyrosine, tryptophan and phenylalanine, as well as methionine-are increased in these conditions. Valine, in particular, has been established as a useful supplemental therapy to the ailing liver. All the BCAA probably compete with AAA for absorption into the brain. Supplemental BCAA with vitamin B6 and zinc help normalize the BCAA:AAA ratio. The BCAA are not without side effects. Leucine alone, for example, exacerbates pellagra and can cause psychosis in pellagra patients by increasing excretion of niacin in the urine. Leucine may lower brain serotonin and dopamine. A dose of 3 g of isoleucine added to the niacin regime has cleared leucine-aggravated psychosis in schizophrenic patients. Isoleucine may have potential as an antipsychotic treatment. Leucine is more highly concentrated in foods than other amino acids. A cup of milk contains 800 mg of leucine and only 500 mg of isoleucine and valine. A cup of wheat germ has about 1.6 g of leucine and 1 g of isoleucine and valine. The ratio evens out in eggs and cheese. One egg and an ounce of most cheeses each contain about 400 mg of leucine and 400 mg of valine and isoleucine. The ratio of leucine to other BCAA is greatest in pork, where leucine is 7 to 8 g and the other BCAA together are only 3 to 4 g (http://www.dcnutrition.com).

Some endogenous production of IAA in mammalian tissues also occurs. It may be produced by the decarboxylation of tryptamine or the oxidative deamination of tryptophan. IAA frequently occurs at low levels in urine and has been found in elevated levels in the urine of patients with phenylketonuria ((PMID: 13610897). Using material extracted from human urine, it was discovered by Kogl in 1933 that Indoleacetic acid is also an important plant hormone (PMID: 13610897). Specifically IAA is a member of the group of phytohormones called auxins. IAA is generally considered to be the most important native auxin. Plant cells synthesize IAA from tryptophan. (wikipedia) IAA and some derivatives can be oxidised by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to cytotoxic species. IAA is only toxic after oxidative decarboxylation; the effect of IAA/HRP is thought to be due in part to the formation of methylene-oxindole, which may conjugate with DNA bases and protein thiols. IAA/HRP could be used as the basis for targeted cancer, a potential new role for plant auxins in cancer therapy.

inost,87-89-8,17268,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): myo-Inositol is an inositol isoform. Inositol is a derivative of cyclohexane with six hydroxyl groups, making it a polyol. It also is known as a sugar alcohol, having exactly the same molecular formula as glucose or other hexoses. Inositol exists in nine possible stereoisomers, of which cis-1,2,3,5-trans-4,6-cyclohexanehexol, or myo-inositol is the most widely occurring form in nature. The other known inositols include scyllo-inositol, muco-inositol, D-chiro-inositol, L-chiro-inositol, neo-inositol, allo-inositol, epi-inositol and cis-inositol. myo-Inositol is found naturally in many foods (particularly in cereals with high bran content) and can be used as a sweetner as it has half the sweetness of sucrose (table sugar). myo-Inositol was once considered a member of the vitamin B complex and given the name: vitamin B8. However, because it is produced by the human body from glucose, it is not an essential nutrient, and therefore cannot be called a vitamin. myo-Inositol is a precursor molecule for a number of secondary messengers including various inositol phosphates. In addition, inositol/myo-inositol is an important component of the lipids known as phosphatidylinositol (PI) phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP). myo-Inositol is synthesized from glucose, via glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) in two steps. First, G-6-P is isomerised by an inositol-3-phosphate synthase enzyme to myo-inositol 1-phosphate, which is then dephosphorylated by an inositol monophosphatase enzyme to give free myo-inositol. In humans, myo-inositol is primarily synthesized in the kidneys at a rate of a few grams per day. myo-Inositol can be used in the management of preterm babies who have or are at a risk of infant respiratory distress syndrome. It is also used as a treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It works by increasing insulin sensitivity, which helps to improve ovarian function and reduce hyperandrogenism.

[PubChem]As a diagnostic agent, inulin is readily soluble and essentially indigestible. It readily passes through the blood and into the urine. It is neither secreted nor resorbed by the kidney making it an excellent indicator for renal clearance rates. The inulin clearance test has largely been succeeded by the creatinine clearance test as a measure of glomerular filtration rate. As a hypoglycemic agent, inulin is not digestible by human enzymes ptyalin and amylase, which are designed to digest starch. As a result, inulin passes through much of the digestive system intact. It is only in the colon that bacteria metabolise inulin, with the release of significant quantities of carbon dioxide and/or methane. Because inulin is not broken down into simple sugars (monosaccharides) by normal digestion, it does not elevate blood sugar levels, hence, helping diabetics regulate blood sugar levels.",Inulin,HMDB0014776,,,C03323,,,,,,JYJIGFIDKWBXDU-UHFFFAOYSA-N,
iodine,7553-56-2,17606,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Iodine is an essential trace element. Chemically, iodine is the least reactive of the halogens, and the most electropositive halogen after astatine. However, iodine does not occur in the free state in nature. As with all other halogens , when freed from its compounds iodine forms diatomic molecules (I2). Iodine and its compounds are primarily used in medicine, photography, and dyes. Iodine is required for the production of thyroid hormones, which are essential for normal brain development, and the fetus, newborn, and young child are particularly vulnerable to iodine deficiency. Physiologically, iodine exists as an ion in the body. The iodine requirement increases during pregnancy and recommended intakes are in the range of 220-250 microg/day. Monitoring iodine status during pregnancy is a challenge. New recommendations from World Health Organization suggest that a median urinary iodine concentration >250 microg/L and <500 microg/L indicates adequate iodine intake in pregnancy. Based on this range, it appears that many pregnant women in have inadequate intakes. Thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration in the newborn is a sensitive indicator of mild iodine deficiency in late pregnancy. The potential adverse effects of mild iodine deficiency during pregnancy are uncertain. Controlled trials of iodine supplementation in mildly iodine-deficient pregnant women suggest beneficial effects on maternal and newborn serum thyroglobulin and thyroid volume, but no effects on maternal and newborn total or free thyroid hormone concentrations. There are no long-term data on the effect of iodine supplementation on birth outcomes or infant development. New data from well-controlled studies indicate that iodine repletion in moderately iodine-deficient school-age children has clear benefits: it improves cognitive and motor function; it also increases concentrations of insulin-like growth factor 1 and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3, and improves somatic growth.

The distinction between different bile acids is minute, depends only on presence or absence of hydroxyl groups on positions 3, 7, and 12. Bile acids are physiological detergents that facilitate excretion, absorption, and transport of fats and sterols in the intestine and liver. Bile acids are also steroidal amphipathic molecules derived from the catabolism of cholesterol. They modulate bile flow and lipid secretion, are essential for the absorption of dietary fats and vitamins, and have been implicated in the regulation of all the key enzymes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Bile acids recirculate through the liver, bile ducts, small intestine and portal vein to form an enterohepatic circuit. They exist as anions at physiological pH and, consequently, require a carrier for transport across the membranes of the enterohepatic tissues. The unique detergent properties of bile acids are essential for the digestion and intestinal absorption of hydrophobic nutrients. Bile acids have potent toxic properties (e.g., membrane disruption) and there are a plethora of mechanisms to limit their accumulation in blood and tissues.

Potassium balance is crucial for regulating the excitability of nerves and muscles and so critical for regulating contractility of cardiac muscle. Although the most important changes seen in the presence of deranged potassium are cardiac, smooth muscle is also affected with increasing muscle weakness, a feature of both hyperkalaemia and hypokalaemia. Physiologically, it exists as an ion in the body. Potassium (K+) is a positively charged electrolyte, cation, which is present throughout the body in both intracellular and extracellular fluids. The majority of body potassium, >90%, are intracellular. It moves freely from intracellular fluid (ICF) to extracellular fluid (ECF) and vice versa when adenosine triphosphate increases the permeability of the cell membrane. It is mainly replaced inside or outside the cells by another cation, sodium (Na+). The movement of potassium into or out of the cells is linked to certain body hormones and also to certain physiological states. Standard laboratory tests measure ECF potassium. Potassium enters the body rapidly during food ingestion. Insulin is produced when a meal is eaten; this causes the temporary movement of potassium from ECF to ICF. Over the ensuing hours, the kidneys excrete the ingested potassium and homeostasis is returned. In the critically ill patient, suffering from hyperkalaemia, this mechanism can be manipulated beneficially by administering high concentration (50%) intravenous glucose. Insulin can be added to the glucose, but glucose alone will stimulate insulin production and cause movement of potassium from ECF to ICF. The stimulation of alpha receptors causes increased movement of potassium from ICF to ECF. A noradrenaline infusion can elevate serum potassium levels. An adrenaline infusion, or elevated adrenaline levels, can lower serum potassium levels. Metabolic acidosis causes a rise in extracellular potassium levels. In this situation, excess of hydrogen ions (H+) are exchanged for intracellular potassium ions, probably as a result of the cellular response to a falling blood pH. Metabolic alkalosis causes the opposite effect, with potassium moving into the cells.

kdn,22594-61-2,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): 3-Deoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-2-nonulosonic acid (KDN) is a sialic acid (Sia) that is ubiquitously expressed in vertebrates during normal development and tumorigenesis. Its expression is thought to be regulated by multiple biosynthetic steps catalyzed by several enzymes, including CMP-Sia synthetase. (PMID 11479279) Sialic acids are frequently the terminal sugars on secreted and cell surface glycoproteins and glycolipids, and their presence can have considerable influence on the biological properties of a cell. For example, the temporal appearance and disappearance of polysialic polymers has been intimately linked with the proper development of neural tissues during embryogenesis. In pathogenic diseases, including meningitis and gastric inflammation, particular microbes recognize cell surface sialic acids when invading host cells. Sialic acid residues can also mask recognition sites such as galactose residues on glycoproteins to prevent their in vivo removal by asialoglycoprotein receptors. In certain cancers, changes in sialic acid amounts, types, and linkages have been associated with tumorogenesis and cancer metastasis.

kynate,492-27-3,18344,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Kynurenic acid (KYNA) is a well-known endogenous antagonist of the glutamate ionotropic excitatory amino acid receptors N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), alphaamino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid and kainate receptors and of the nicotine cholinergic subtype alpha 7 receptors. KYNA neuroprotective and anticonvulsive activities have been demonstrated in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases. Because of KYNA's neuromodulatory character, its involvement has been speculatively linked to the pathogenesis of a number of neurological conditions including those in the ageing process. Different patterns of abnormalities in various stages of KYNA metabolism in the CNS have been reported in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. In HIV-1-infected patients and in patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis a marked rise of KYNA metabolism was seen. In the ageing process KYNA metabolism in the CNS of rats shows a characteristic pattern of changes throughout the life span. A marked increase of the KYNA content in the CNS occurs before the birth, followed by a dramatic decline on the day of birth. A low activity was seen during ontogenesis, and a slow and progressive enhancement occurs during maturation and ageing. This remarkable profile of KYNA metabolism alterations in the mammalian brain has been suggested to result from the development of the organisation of neuronal connections and synaptic plasticity, development of receptor recognition sites, maturation and ageing. There is significant evidence that KYNA can improve cognition and memory, but it has also been demonstrated that it interferes with working memory. Impairment of cognitive function in various neurodegenerative disorders is accompanied by profound reduction and/or elevation of KYNA metabolism. The view that enhancement of CNS KYNA levels could underlie cognitive decline is supported by the increased KYNA metabolism in Alzheimer's disease, by the increased KYNA metabolism in down's syndrome and the enhancement of KYNA function during the early stage of Huntington's disease. Kynurenic acid is the only endogenous N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist identified up to now, that mediates glutamatergic hypofunction. Schizophrenia is a disorder of dopaminergic neurotransmission, but modulation of the dopaminergic system by glutamatergic neurotransmission seems to play a key role. Despite the NMDA receptor antagonism, kynurenic acid also blocks, in lower doses, the nicotinergic acetycholine receptor, i.e., increased kynurenic acid levels can explain psychotic symptoms and cognitive deterioration. Kynurenic acid levels are described to be higher in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and in critical central nervous system (CNS) regions of schizophrenics as compared to controls.

Mutations in DHTKD1 (dehydrogenase E1 and transketolase domain-containing protein 1) have been shown to cause human 2-aminoadipic aciduria and 2-oxoadipic aciduria via impaired decarboxylation of 2-oxoadipate to glutaryl-CoA, which is the last step in the lysine degradation pathway (PMID: 23141293). Aging, diabetes, sepsis, and renal failure are known to catalyze the oxidation of lysyl residues to form 2-aminoadipic acid in human skin collagen and potentially other tissues (PMID: 18448817). Proteolytic breakdown of these tissues can lead to the release of free 2-aminoadipic acid. Studies in rats indicate that aminoadipic acid (along with the three branched-chain amino acids - leucine, valine, and isoleucine) levels are elevated in the pre-diabetic phase and so aminoadipic acid may serve as a predictive biomarker for the development of diabetes (PMID: 15389298). Long-term hyperglycemia of endothelial cells can also lead to elevated levels of aminoadipate which is thought to be a sign of lysine breakdown through oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS) (PMID: 21961526). 2-Aminoadipate is a potential small-molecule marker of oxidative stress (PMID: 21647514). Therefore, depending on the circumstances aminoadipic acid can act as an acidogen, a diabetogen, an atherogen and a metabotoxin. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A diabetogen is a compound that can lead to type 2 diabetes. An atherogen is a compound that leads to atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of aminoadipic acid are associated with at least two inborn errors of metabolism including, 2-aminoadipic aciduria and 2-oxoadipic aciduria. Aminoadipic acid is an organic acid and abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart abnormalities, kidney abnormalities, liver damage, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of the untreated IEMs mentioned above. Many affected children with organic acidemias experience intellectual disability or delayed development. In adults, acidosis or acidemia is characterized by headaches, confusion, feeling tired, tremors, sleepiness, and seizures. As a diabetogen, serum aminoadipic levels appear to regulate glucose homeostasis and have been highly predictive of individuals who later develop diabetes (PMID: 24091325). In particular, aminoadipic acid lowers fasting plasma glucose levels and enhances insulin secretion from human islets. As an atherogen, aminoadipic acid has been found to be produced at high levels via protein lysine oxidation in atherosclerotic plaques (PMID: 28069522).",Aminoadipic acid,HMDB0000510,,,C00956,CPD-468,FDB021812,L2aadp,[H][N+]([H])([H])C([H])(C([O-])=O)C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([O-])=O,"(+/-)-2-aminoadipic acid***Aad***alpha-Aminoadipic acid***DL-2-Aminoadipic acid***DL-2-Aminohexanedioic acid***DL-alpha-Aminoadipic acid***(+/-)-2-aminoadipate***Aminoadipate***a-Aminoadipate***a-Aminoadipic acid***alpha-Aminoadipate***α-aminoadipate***α-aminoadipic acid***DL-2-Aminoadipate***DL-2-Aminohexanedioate***DL-a-Aminoadipate***DL-a-Aminoadipic acid***DL-alpha-Aminoadipate***DL-α-aminoadipate***DL-α-aminoadipic acid***2-Aminoadipate***2-Aminoadipic acid***alpha-amino-Adipic acid***L-2-Aminoadipate***L-2-Aminoadipic acid***L-2-Aminohexanedioate***L-2-Aminohexanedioic acid***L-alpha-Aminoadipate***L-alpha-Aminoadipic acid***2 Aminoadipic acid***Acid, 2-aminohexanedioic***Acid, 2 aminoadipic***alpha Aminoadipic acid***2 Aminohexanedioic acid***Aminoadipic acid, 2***Acid, alpha-aminoadipic***Acid, 2-aminoadipic",OYIFNHCXNCRBQI-BYPYZUCNSA-M,"InChI=1S/C6H11NO4/c7-4(6(10)11)2-1-3-5(8)9/h4H,1-3,7H2,(H,8,9)(H,10,11)/p-1/t4-/m0/s1"

lac_L,79-33-4,422,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Lactic acid is an organic acid. It is a chiral molecule, consisting of two optical isomers, L-lactic acid and D-lactic acid, with the L-isomer being the most common in living organisms. Lactic acid plays a role in several biochemical processes and is produced in the muscles during intense activity. In animals, L-lactate is constantly produced from pyruvate via the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in a process of fermentation during normal metabolism and exercise. It does not increase in concentration until the rate of lactate production exceeds the rate of lactate removal. This is governed by a number of factors, including monocarboxylate transporters, lactate concentration, the isoform of LDH, and oxidative capacity of tissues. The concentration of blood lactate is usually 1-2 mmol/L at rest, but can rise to over 20 mmol/L during intense exertion. There are some indications that lactate, and not glucose, is preferentially metabolized by neurons in the brain of several mammalian species, including mice, rats, and humans. Glial cells, using the lactate shuttle, are responsible for transforming glucose into lactate, and for providing lactate to the neurons. Lactate measurement in critically ill patients has been traditionally used to stratify patients with poor outcomes. However, plasma lactate levels are the result of a finely tuned interplay of factors that affect the balance between its production and its clearance. When the oxygen supply does not match its consumption, organisms adapt in many different ways, up to the point when energy failure occurs. Lactate, being part of the adaptive response, may then be used to assess the severity of the supply/demand imbalance. In such a scenario, the time to intervention becomes relevant: early and effective treatment may allow tissues and cells to revert to a normal state, as long as the oxygen machinery (i.e. mitochondria) is intact. Conversely, once the mitochondria are deranged, energy failure occurs even in the presence of normoxia. The lactate increase in critically ill patients may, therefore, be viewed as an early marker of a potentially reversible state (PMID: 16356243). When present in sufficiently high levels, lactic acid can act as an oncometabolite, an immunosuppressant, an acidogen, and a metabotoxin. An oncometabolite is a compound that promotes tumor growth and survival. An immunosuppressant reduces or arrests the activity of the immune system. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of lactic acid are associated with at least a dozen inborn errors of metabolism, including 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyryl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, biotinidase deficiency, fructose-1,6-diphosphatase deficiency, glycogen storage disease type 1A (GSD1A) or Von Gierke disease, glycogenosis type IB, glycogenosis type IC, glycogenosis type VI, Hers disease, lactic acidemia, Leigh syndrome, methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency, pyruvate decarboxylase E1 component deficiency, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency, pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, and short chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (SCAD deficiency). Locally high concentrations of lactic acid or lactate are found near many tumors due to the upregulation of lactate dehydrogenase (PMID: 15279558). Lactic acid produced by tumors through aerobic glycolysis acts as an immunosuppressant and tumor promoter (PMID: 23729358). Indeed, lactic acid has been found to be a key player or regulator in the development and malignant progression of a variety of cancers (PMID: 22084445). A number of studies have demonstrated that malignant transformation is associated with an increase in aerobic cellular lactate excretion. Lactate concentrations in various carcinomas (e.g. uterine cervix, head and neck, colorectal region) at first diagnosis of the disease, can be relatively low or extremely high (up to 40 µmol/g) in different individual tumors or within the same lesion (PMID: 15279558). High molar concentrations of lactate are correlated with a high incidence of distant metastasis. Low lactate tumors (< median of approximately 8 µmol/g) are associated with both an overall longer and disease-free survival compared to high lactate lesions (lactate > approximately 8 µmol/g). Lactate-induced secretion of hyaluronan by tumor-associated fibroblasts creates a milieu favourable for cell migration and metastases (PMID: 22084445). An acidic environment (pH 6-6.5), which is common in many tumors, allows tumor cells to evade the immune response, and therefore allows them to grow unchecked. Locally high concentrations of lactic acid are known to markedly impede the function of normal immune cells and will lead to a loss of T-cell function of human tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (PMID: 22084445). Lactic acid is also an organic acid and acts as a general acidogen. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy).

lcts,63-42-3,36219,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): alpha-Lactose is the major sugar present in milk and the main source of energy supplied to the newborn mammalian in its mother's milk. Lactose is also an important osmotic regulator of lactation. It is digested by the intestinal lactase (EC 3.2.1.108), an enzyme expressed in newborns. Its activity declines following weaning. As a result, adult mammals are normally lactose-intolerant and more than 75% of the human adult population suffers from lactase deficiency. Lactase deficiency is present in up to 80 percent of blacks and Latinos, and up to 100 percent of American Indians and Asians. Persons with lactose intolerance are unable to digest significant amounts of lactose. Common symptoms include abdominal pain and bloating, excessive flatus, and watery stool following the ingestion of foods containing lactose. A sizable number of adults believe they are lactose intolerant but do not actually have impaired lactose digestion, and some persons with lactase deficiency can tolerate moderate amounts of ingested lactose. A diagnosis of lactose intolerance can usually be made with a careful history supported by dietary manipulation. If necessary, diagnosis can be confirmed by using a breath hydrogen or lactose tolerance test. These mostly uncomfortable symptoms of lactose maldigestion are blamed for a variably dairy consumption. There is, however, emerging evidence that certain lactic acid-producing bacteria, which selectively consume prebiotics, may be beneficial against some lower intestinal diseases. Lactose maldigestion and lactose should perhaps be re-evaluated as a potential provider of such a prebiotic. Treatment consists primarily of avoiding lactose-containing foods. Lactase enzyme supplements may be helpful.

leu_L,61-90-5,15603,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): L-leucine, also known as leu or 2-amino-4-methylvaleric acid, belongs to leucine and derivatives class of compounds. Those are compounds containing leucine or a derivative thereof resulting from reaction of leucine at the amino group or the carboxy group, or from the replacement of any hydrogen of glycine by a heteroatom. L-leucine is soluble (in water) and a moderately acidic compound (based on its pKa). L-leucine can be found primarily in most biofluids, including blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), feces, and sweat, as well as throughout most human tissues. Within the cell, L-leucine is primarily located in the mitochondria. It can also be found in the extracellular space. L-leucine exists in all living species, ranging from bacteria to humans. L-leucine is a non-carcinogenic (not listed by IARC) potentially toxic compound. Leucine (abbreviated as Leu or L) is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. It contains an α-amino group (which is in the protonated −NH3+ form under biological conditions), an α-carboxylic acid group (which is in the deprotonated −COO− form under biological conditions), and a side chain isobutyl group, making it a non-polar aliphatic amino acid. It is essential in humans, meaning the body cannot synthesize it: it must be obtained from the diet. Human dietary sources are foods that contain protein, such as meats, dairy products, soy products, beans and legumes. In the genetic code it is encoded by the six codons UUA, UUG, CUU, CUC, CUA, and CUG (Wikipedia). This group of essential amino acids are identified as the branched-chain amino acids, BCAAs. Branched chain amino acids (BCAA) are essential amino acids whose carbon structure is marked by a branch point. These three amino acids are critical to human life and are particularly involved in stress, energy and muscle metabolism. BCAA supplementation as therapy, both oral and intravenous, in human health and disease holds great promise. 'BCAA' denotes valine, isoleucine and leucine which are branched chain essential amino acids. Despite their structural similarities, the branched amino acids have different metabolic routes, with valine going solely to carbohydrates, leucine solely to fats and isoleucine to both. The different metabolism accounts for different requirements for these essential amino acids in humans: 12 mg/kg, 14 mg/kg and 16 mg/kg of valine, leucine and isoleucine respectively. Furthermore, these amino acids have different deficiency symptoms. Valine deficiency is marked by neurological defects in the brain, while isoleucine deficiency is marked by muscle tremors. Many types of inborn errors of BCAA metabolism exist, and are marked by various abnormalities. The most common form is the maple syrup urine disease, marked by a characteristic urinary odor. Other abnormalities are associated with a wide range of symptoms, such as mental retardation, ataxia, hypoglycemia, spinal muscle atrophy, rash, vomiting and excessive muscle movement. Most forms of BCAA metabolism errors are corrected by dietary restriction of BCAA and at least one form is correctable by supplementation with 10 mg of biotin daily. BCAA are useful because they are metabolized primarily by muscle. Stress stat- e.g surgery, trauma, cirrhosis, infections, fever and starvation--require proportionately more BCAA than other amino acids and probably proportionately more leucine than either valine or isoleucine. BCAA and other amino acids are frequently fed intravenously (TPN) to malnourished surgical patients and in some cases of severe trauma. BCAA, particularly leucine, stimulate protein synthesis, increase reutilization of amino acids in many organs and reduce protein breakdown. Furthermore, leucine can be an important source of calories, and is superior as fuel to the ubiquitous intravenous glucose (dextrose). Leucine also stimulates insulin release, which in turn stimulates protein synthesis and inhibits protein breakdown. These effects are particularly useful in athletic training. BCAA should also replace the use of steroids as commonly used by weightlifters. Huntington's chorea and anorexic disorders both are characterized by low serum BCAA. These diseases, as well as forms of Parkinson's, may respond to BCAA therapy. BCAA, and particularly leucine, are among the amino acids most essential for muscle health (http://www.dcnutrition.com).",L-Leucine,HMDB0000687,,,C00123,LEU,FDB001946,leu_L,[H]OC(=O)[C@@]([H])(N([H])[H])C([H])([H])C([H])(C([H])([H])[H])C([H])([H])[H],"(2S)-2-amino-4-Methylpentanoic acid***(2S)-alpha-2-amino-4-Methylvaleric acid***(2S)-alpha-Leucine***(S)-(+)-Leucine***(S)-Leucine***2-amino-4-Methylvaleric acid***L***L-Leucin***L-Leuzin***Leu***LEUCINE***(2S)-2-amino-4-Methylpentanoate***(2S)-a-2-amino-4-Methylvalerate***(2S)-a-2-amino-4-Methylvaleric acid***(2S)-alpha-2-amino-4-Methylvalerate***(2S)-α-2-amino-4-methylvalerate***(2S)-α-2-amino-4-methylvaleric acid***(2S)-a-Leucine***(2S)-α-leucine***2-amino-4-Methylvalerate***(S)-2-amino-4-Methylpentanoate***(S)-2-amino-4-Methylpentanoic acid***(S)-2-amino-4-Methylvalerate***(S)-2-amino-4-Methylvaleric acid***4-Methyl-L-norvaline***L-(+)-Leucine***L-a-Aminoisocaproate***L-a-Aminoisocaproic acid***L-alpha-Aminoisocaproate***L-alpha-Aminoisocaproic acid***Leucine, L-isomer***L-Isomer leucine***Leucine, L isomer",ROHFNLRQFUQHCH-YFKPBYRVSA-N,"InChI=1S/C6H13NO2/c1-4(2)3-5(7)6(8)9/h4-5H,3,7H2,1-2H3,(H,8,9)/t5-/m0/s1"

leuktrB4,71160-24-2,15647,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Leukotriene B4 is the major metabolite in neutrophil polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Leukotrienes are metabolites of arachidonic acid derived from the action of 5-LO (5-lipoxygenase). The immediate product of 5-LO is LTA4 (leukotriene A4), which is enzymatically converted into either LTB4 (leukotriene B4) by LTA4 hydrolase or LTC4 (leukotriene C4) by LTC4 synthase. The regulation of leukotriene production occurs at various levels, including expression of 5-LO, translocation of 5-LO to the perinuclear region and phosphorylation to either enhance or inhibit the activity of 5-LO. Biologically active LTB4 is metabolized by w-oxidation carried out by specific cytochrome P450s (CYP4F) followed by b-oxidation from the w-carboxy position and after CoA ester formation. Other specific pathways of leukotriene metabolism include the 12-hydroxydehydrogenase/ 15-oxo-prostaglandin-13-reductase that form a series of conjugated diene metabolites that have been observed to be excreted into human urine. Metabolism of LTC4 occurs by sequential peptide cleavage reactions involving a gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase that forms LTD4 (leukotriene D4) and a membrane-bound dipeptidase that converts LTD4 into LTE4 (leukotriene E4) before w-oxidation. These metabolic transformations of the primary leukotrienes are critical for termination of their biological activity, and defects in expression of participating enzymes may be involved in specific genetic disease. The term leukotriene was coined to indicate the presence of three conjugated double bonds within the 20-carbon structure of arachidonic acid as well as the fact that these compounds were derived from leucocytes such as PMNNs or transformed mast cells. Interestingly, most of the cells known to express 5-LO are of myeloid origin, which includes neutrophils, eosinophils, mast cells, macrophages, basophils and monocytes. Leukotriene biosynthesis begins with the specific oxidation of arachidonic acid by a free radical mechanism as a consequence of interaction with 5-LO. The first enzymatic step involves the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from C-7 of arachidonate followed by the addition of molecular oxygen to form 5-HpETE (5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid). A second enzymatic step is also catalysed by 5-LO and involves removal of a hydrogen atom from C-10, resulting in formation of the conjugated triene epoxide LTA4. LTA4 must then be released by 5-LO and encounter either LTA4-H (LTA4 hydrolase) or LTC4-S [LTC4 (leukotriene C4) synthase]. LTA4-H can stereospecifically add water to C-12 while retaining a specific double-bond geometry, leading to LTB4 [leukotriene B4, 5(S),12(R)-dihydroxy-6,8,10,14-(Z,E,E,Z)-eicosatetraenoic acid]. If LTA4 encounters LTC4-S, then the reactive epoxide is opened at C-6 by the thiol anion of glutathione to form the product LTC4 [5(S)-hydroxy-6(R)-S-glutathyionyl-7,9,11,14- (E,E,Z,Z)-eicosatetraenoic acid], essentially a glutathionyl adduct of oxidized arachidonic acid. Both of these terminal leukotrienes are biologically active in that specific GPCRs recognize these chemical structures and receptor recognition initiates complex intracellular signalling cascades. In order for these molecules to serve as lipid mediators, however, they must be released from the biosynthetic cell into the extracellular milieu so that they can encounter the corresponding GPCRs. Surprising features of this cascade include the recognition of the assembly of critical enzymes at the perinuclear region of the cell and even localization of 5-LO within the nucleus of some cells. Under some situations, the budding phagosome has been found to assemble these proteins. Non-enzymatic proteins such as FLAP are now known as critical partners of this protein-machine assembly. An unexpected pathway of leukotriene biosynthesis involves the transfer of the chemically reactive intermediate, LTA4, from the biosynthetic cell followed by conversion into LTB4 or LTC4 by other cells that do not express 5-LO. (PMID 17623009). Leukotrienes are eicosanoids. The eicosanoids consist of the prostaglandins (PGs), thromboxanes (TXs), leukotrienes (LTs) and lipoxins (LXs).

leuktrB4wcooh,80434-82-8,27562,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): 20-Carboxyleukotriene B4 is an omega-oxidized metabolite of leukotriene B4 (LTB4). Neutrophil microsomes are known to oxidize 20-hydroxy-LTB4 (20-OH-LTB4) to its 20-oxo and 20-carboxy derivatives in the presence of NADPH. This activity has been ascribed to LTB4 omega-hydroxylase (cytochrome P-450LTB omega). Leukotriene B4 release from polymorphonuclear granulocytes of severely burned patients was reduced as compared to healthy donor cells. This decrease is due to an enhanced conversion of LTB4 into the 20-hydroxy- and 20-carboxy-metabolites and further to a decreased LTB4-synthesis. LTB4 is the major metabolite in neutrophil polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Leukotrienes are metabolites of arachidonic acid derived from the action of 5-LO (5-lipoxygenase). The immediate product of 5-LO is LTA4 (leukotriene A4), which is enzymatically converted into either LTB4 (leukotriene B4) by LTA4 hydrolase or LTC4 (leukotriene C4) by LTC4 synthase. The regulation of leukotriene production occurs at various levels, including expression of 5-LO, translocation of 5-LO to the perinuclear region and phosphorylation to either enhance or inhibit the activity of 5-LO. Biologically active LTB4 is metabolized by w-oxidation carried out by specific cytochrome P450s (CYP4F) followed by beta-oxidation from the w-carboxy position and after CoA ester formation. Other specific pathways of leukotriene metabolism include the 12-hydroxydehydrogenase/ 15-oxo-prostaglandin-13-reductase that form a series of conjugated diene metabolites that have been observed to be excreted into human urine. Metabolism of LTC4 occurs by sequential peptide cleavage reactions involving a gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase that forms LTD4 (leukotriene D4) and a membrane-bound dipeptidase that converts LTD4 into LTE4 (leukotriene E4) before w-oxidation. These metabolic transformations of the primary leukotrienes are critical for termination of their biological activity, and defects in expression of participating enzymes may be involved in specific genetic disease.

Eosinophils, one of the principal cell types recruited to and activated at sites of allergic inflammation, is capable of elaborating lipid mediators, including leukotrienes derived from the oxidative metabolism of arachidonic acid (AA). Potentially 'activated' eosinophils may elaborate greater quantities of LTC4, than normal eosinophils. These activated eosinophils thus are 'primed' for enhanced LTC4 generation in response to subsequent stimuli. Some recognized priming stimuli are chemoattractants (e.g., eotaxin, PAF) that may participate in the recruitment of eosinophils to sites of allergic inflammation. The mechanisms by which chemoattractants and other activating cytokines (e.g., interleukin (IL)-5) or extracellular matrix components (e.g., fibronectin) enhance eosinophil eicosanoid formation are pertinent to the functions of these eicosanoids as paracrine mediators of allergic inflammation. Some eosinophil-derived eicosanoids may be active in down-regulating inflammation. It is increasingly likely that eicosanoids synthesized within cells, including eosinophils, may have intracellular (e.g., intracrine) roles in regulating cell functions, in addition to the more recognized activities of eicosanoids as paracrine mediators of inflammation. Acting extracellularly, the cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs) LTC4 and its extracellular derivatives, LTD4 and LTE4 are key paracrine mediators pertinent to asthma and allergic diseases. Based on their receptor-mediated capabilities, they can elicit bronchoconstriction, mucous hypersecretion, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, increased microvascular permeability, and additional eosinophil infiltration. Eosinophils are a major source of CysLTs and have been identified as the principal LTC4 synthase expressing cells in bronchial mucosal biopsies of asthmatic subjects.

LTD4 is present at high levels in many inflammatory conditions, and areas of chronic inflammation have an increased risk for subsequent cancer development; LTD4 is associated with the pathogenesis of several inflammatory disorders, such as asthma and inflammatory bowel disease. Exposure to LTD4 increases survival and proliferation in intestinal epithelial cells. CysLT1 regulator is up-regulated in colon cancer tissue and LTD4 signalling facilitates the survival of cancer cells. LTD4 could reduce apoptosis in non-transformed epithelial cells. LTD4 causes up-regulation of b-catenin through the CysLT1 receptor, PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) and GSK-3b (glycogen synthase kinase 3b). LTD4 induces b-catenin translocation to the nucleus and activation of TCF/LEF family of transcription factors.

Lhcystin,,17485,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Homocystine is the double-bonded form of homocysteine, but it occurs only transiently before being converted to the harmless cystathionine via a vitamin B6-dependent enzyme. Homocystine and homocysteine-cysteine mixed disulfide account for >98% of total homocysteine in plasma from healthy individuals (PMID 11592966). Oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is thought to be a major factor in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis. Elevated plasma homocysteine is an accepted risk factor for atherosclerosis, and may act through LDL oxidation, although this is controversial. However, the major thiol in plasma is cysteine, which is present at concentrations approximately 10 times greater than homocysteine; therefore homocystine in plasma is insignificant, and consequently homocystine is unlikely to influence LDL oxidation in vivo (PMID 14732479). Increasing evidence supports a role for an elevation of homocysteine in schizophrenia. It has been demonstrated that neural tube defects are related to a genetic defect in homocysteine metabolism. Sufficient intake of folic acid is believed to reduce this risk by enhancing methylation of homocysteine and its conversion to methionine, thereby compensating for this genetic defect (homocystinuria). Plasma homocysteine levels are elevated when folate levels are in the lower half of the normal range (PMID 16143442).",L-Homocystine,HMDB0000676,,,C01817,,FDB022176,Lhcystin,[H]OC(=O)C([H])(N([H])[H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])SSC([H])([H])C([H])([H])[C@]([H])(N([H])[H])C(=O)O[H],"4,4'-Dithiobis(2-aminobutyric acid)***4,4'-Dithiobis-2-amino-L-butyrate***4,4'-Dithiobis-2-amino-L-butyric acid***[S-(R*,r*)]-4,4'-dithiobis-2-amino-butanoate***[S-(R*,r*)]-4,4'-dithiobis-2-amino-butanoic acid",ZTVZLYBCZNMWCF-ZBHICJROSA-N,"InChI=1S/C8H16N2O4S2/c9-5(7(11)12)1-3-15-16-4-2-6(10)8(13)14/h5-6H,1-4,9-10H2,(H,11,12)(H,13,14)/t5-,6?/m0/s1"

Recently, however, d-limonene has been shown to cause a male rat-specific kidney toxicity referred to as hyaline droplet nephropathy. Furthermore, chronic exposure to d-limonene causes a significant incidence of renal tubular tumors exclusively in male rats. Although d-limonene is not carcinogenic in female rats or male and female mice given much higher dosages, the male rat-specific nephrocarcinogenicity of d-limonene may raise some concern regarding the safety of d-limonene for human consumption. A considerable body of scientific data has indicated that the renal toxicity of d-limonene results from the accumulation of a protein, alpha 2u-globulin, in male rat kidney proximal tubule lysosomes. This protein is synthesized exclusively by adult male rats. Other species, including humans, synthesize proteins that share significant homology with alpha 2u-globulin. However, none of these proteins, including the mouse equivalent of alpha 2u-globulin, can produce this toxicity, indicating a unique specificity for alpha 2u-globulin. With chronic exposure to d-limonene, the hyaline droplet nephropathy progresses and the kidney shows tubular cell necrosis, granular cast formation at the corticomedullary junction, and compensatory cell proliferation. Both d-limonene and cis-d-limonene-1,2-oxide (the major metabolite involved in this toxicity) are negative in vitro mutagenicity screens. Therefore, the toxicity-related renal cell proliferation is believed to be integrally involved in the carcinogenicity of d-limonene as persistent elevations in renal cell proliferation may increase fixation of spontaneously altered DNA or serve to promote spontaneously initiated cells. The scientific data base demonstrates that the tumorigenic activity of d-limonene in male rats is not relevant to humans. The three major lines of evidence supporting the human safety of d-limonene are (1) the male rat specificity of the nephrotoxicity and carcinogenicity; (2) the pivotal role that alpha 2u-globulin plays in the toxicity, as evidenced by the complete lack of toxicity in other species despite the presence of structurally similar proteins; and (3) the lack of genotoxicity of both d-limonene and d-limonene-1,2-oxide, supporting the concept of a nongenotoxic mechanism, namely, sustained renal cell proliferation.

lipoate,1200-22-2,30314,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Lipoic acid is a vitamin-like antioxidant that acts as a free-radical scavenger. Alpha-lipoic acid is also known as thioctic acid. It is a naturally occurring compound that is synthesized by both plants and animals. Lipoic acid contains two thiol groups which may be either oxidized or reduced. The reduced form is known as dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA). Lipoic acid (Delta E= -0.288) is therefore capable of thiol-disulfide exchange, giving it antioxidant activity. Lipoate is a critical cofactor for aerobic metabolism, participating in the transfer of acyl or methylamine groups via the 2-Oxoacid dehydrogenase (2-OADH) or alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of alpha-ketoglutarate to succinyl CoA. This activity results in the catabolism of the branched chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine). Lipoic acid also participates in the glycine cleavage system(GCV). The glycine cleavage system is a multi-enzyme complex that catalyzes the oxidation of glycine to form 5,10 methylene tetrahydrofolate, an important cofactor in nucleic acid synthesis. Since Lipoic acid is an essential cofactor for many enzyme complexes, it is essential for aerobic life as we know it. This system is used by many organisms and plays a crucial role in the photosynthetic carbon cycle. Lipoic acid was first postulated to be an effective antioxidant when it was found it prevented vitamin C and vitamin E deficiency. It is able to scavenge reactive oxygen species and reduce other metabolites, such as glutathione or vitamins, maintaining a healthy cellular redox state. Lipoic acid has been shown in cell culture experiments to increase cellular uptake of glucose by recruiting the glucose transporter GLUT4 to the cell membrane, suggesting its use in diabetes. Studies of rat aging have suggested that the use of L-carnitine and lipoic acid results in improved memory performance and delayed structural mitochondrial decay. As a result, it may be helpful for people with Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease. -- Wikipedia.",(R)-lipoic acid,HMDB0001451,,,C00725,LIPOIC-ACID,FDB022631,Lipoate,[H]OC(=O)C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])[C@@]1([H])SSC([H])([H])C1([H])[H],"(+)-alpha-Lipoic acid***(R)-(+)-Lipoate***(R)-(+)-Lipoic acid***(R)-1,2-Dithiolane-3-pentanoic acid***(R)-1,2-Dithiolane-3-valeric acid***(R)-6,8-Thioctic acid***alpha-Lipoic acid***Lipoic acid***R-(+)-Lipoic acid***R-LA***RLA***Thioctic acid***Thioctic acid D-form***(+)-a-Lipoate***(+)-a-Lipoic acid***(+)-alpha-Lipoate***(+)-α-lipoate***(+)-α-lipoic acid***(R)-Lipoate***(R)-1,2-Dithiolane-3-pentanoate***(R)-1,2-Dithiolane-3-valerate***(R)-6,8-Thioctate***a-Lipoate***a-Lipoic acid***alpha-Lipoate***α-lipoate***α-lipoic acid***Lipoate***R-(+)-Lipoate***Thioctate***Thioctate D-form***Alpha Lippon al***Alpha-Lippon al***AlphaLippon al***Alphaflam***Hexal brand OF thioctic acid***Injekt, thiogamma***Liponsaure ratiopharm***Liponsaure-ratiopharm***Stadapharm brand OF thioctic acid***Thioctacide T***Verla lipon***Viatris brand OF thioctic acid***alpha Liponaure heumann***alpha Liponsaure von CT***AlphaLiponsaure von CT***Duralipon***Ratiopharm brand OF thioctic acid***Aliud brand OF thioctic acid***Alpha-Liponsaure sofotec***AlphaLipon stada***Azulipont***Heumann brand OF thioctic acid***Illa brand OF thioctic acid***Illa brand OF thioctic acid tromethamine***Juta brand OF thioctic acid***MTW Alphaliponsaure***Pleomix Alpha***PleomixAlpha***PleomixAlpha N***Q Pharm brand OF thioctic acid***Q-Pharm brand OF thioctic acid***Thiogamma injekt***alpha Vibolex***AlphaVibolex***biomo Brand OF thioctic acid***biomo-Lipon***Biomolipon***CT-Arzneimittel brand OF thioctic acid***Acid, alpha-lipoic***Alpha Lipogamma***Alpha Lipon stada***Alpha-Lipogamma***Alpha-Lipon stada***AlphaLipogamma***AlphaLiponsaure sofotec***Fenint***Juthiac***Merck dura brand OF thioctic acid***Pleomix Alpha N***Rosen brand OF thioctic acid***Thiogamma oral***Tromlipon***Trommsdorgg brand OF thioctic acid***Viatris brand OF thioctic acid tromethamine***Worwag brand OF thioctic acid***Worwag brand OF thioctic acid meglumine***alpha Lipoic acid***alpha-Liponsaure von CT***alpha-Vibolex***AlphaLiponaure heumann***biomo Lipon***CT Arzneimittel brand OF thioctic acid***Esparma brand OF thioctic acid***Alpha Liponsaure sofotec***Azupharma brand OF thioctic acid***Generosan brand OF thioctic acid***Lichtenstein brand OF thioctic acid***Liponsaureratiopharm***MTW Brand OF thioctic acid***MTW-Alphaliponsaure***MTWAlphaliponsaure***Neurium***Pharmacia brand OF thioctic acid***Pleomix-Alpha***Pleomix-Alpha N***Sofotec brand OF thioctic acid***Thioctacid***Verla brand OF thioctic acid***Verla-lipon***VerlaLipon***alpha-Liponaure heumann***Espa lipon***Espa-lipon***Espalipon",AGBQKNBQESQNJD-ZETCQYMHSA-N,"InChI=1S/C8H14O2S2/c9-8(10)4-2-1-3-7-5-6-11-12-7/h7H,1-6H2,(H,9,10)/t7-/m0/s1"

lnlnca,463-40-1,27432,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) is a polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA). It is a member of the group of essential fatty acids called omega-3 fatty acids. Alpha-linolenic acid, in particular, is not synthesized by mammals and therefore is an essential dietary requirement for all mammals. Certain nuts (English walnuts) and vegetable oils (canola, soybean, flaxseed/linseed, olive) are particularly rich in alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). Omega-3 fatty acids get their name based on the location of one of their first double bond. In all omega-3 fatty acids, the first double bond is located between the third and fourth carbon atom counting from the methyl end of the fatty acid (n-3). Although humans and other mammals can synthesize saturated and some monounsaturated fatty acids from carbon groups in carbohydrates and proteins, they lack the enzymes necessary to insert a cis double bond at the n-6 or the n-3 position of a fatty acid. Omega-3 fatty acids like a-linolenic acid are important structural components of cell membranes. When incorporated into phospholipids, they affect cell membrane properties such as fluidity, flexibility, permeability and the activity of membrane bound enzymes. Omega-3 fatty acids can modulate the expression of a number of genes, including those involved with fatty acid metabolism and inflammation. Alpha linolenic acid and other omega 3 fatty acids may regulate gene expression by interacting with specific transcription factors, including peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs) and liver X receptors (LXRs).

When human skin is exposed to ultraviolet radiation, epidermal 7-dehydrocholesterol is converted to previtamin D, and during prolonged exposure, the synthesis of previtamin D3 reaches a plateau at about 10 to 15 percent of the original 7-dehydrocholesterol content, and previtamin D3 is photoisomerized to two biologically inert isomers and lumisterol 3 is one of them (the other one being lumisterol 3). Therefore, lumisterol 3 is a metabolite to chronic exposure to sunlight. Lumisterol 3, as well as other photoisomers of vitamin D3 and previtamin D3 has been demonstrated to have inhibited keratinocyte proliferation.

lvst,75330-75-5,40303,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Lovastatin is a cholesterol-lowering agent that belongs to the class of medications called statins. It was the second agent of this class discovered. It was discovered by Alfred Alberts and his team at Merck in 1978 after screening only 18 compounds over 2 weeks. The agent, also known as mevinolin, was isolated from the fungi <i>Aspergillus terreus</i>. Research on this compound was suddenly shut down in 1980 and the drug was not approved until 1987. Interesting, Akira Endo at Sankyo Co. (Japan) patented lovastatin isolated from <i>Monascus ruber</i> four months before Merck. Lovastatin was found to be 2 times more potent than its predecessor, mevastatin, the first discovered statin. Like mevastatin, lovastatin is structurally similar to hydroxymethylglutarate (HMG), a substituent of HMG-Coenzyme A (HMG-CoA), a substrate of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway via the mevalonic acid pathway. Lovastatin is a competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase with a binding affinity 20,000 times greater than HMG-CoA. Lovastatin differs structurally from mevastatin by a single methyl group at the 6 position. Lovastatin is a prodrug that is activated by <i>in vivo</i> hydrolysis of the lactone ring.

lys_L,56-87-1,18019,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): L-lysine is an essential amino acid. Normal requirements for lysine have been found to be about 8 g per day or 12 mg/kg in adults. Children and infants need more, 44 mg/kg per day for an eleven to-twelve-year old, and 97 mg/kg per day for three-to six-month old. Lysine is highly concentrated in muscle compared to most other amino acids. Lysine is high in foods such as wheat germ, cottage cheese and chicken. Of meat products, wild game and pork have the highest concentration of lysine. Fruits and vegetables contain little lysine, except avocados. Normal lysine metabolism is dependent upon many nutrients including niacin, vitamin B6, riboflavin, vitamin C, glutamic acid and iron. Excess arginine antagonizes lysine. Several inborn errors of lysine metabolism are known, such as cystinuria, hyperdibasic aminoaciduria I, lysinuric protein intolerance, propionic acidemia, and tyrosinemia I. Most are marked by mental retardation with occasional diverse symptoms such as absence of secondary sex characteristics, undescended testes, abnormal facial structure, anemia, obesity, enlarged liver and spleen, and eye muscle imbalance. Lysine also may be a useful adjunct in the treatment of osteoporosis. Although high protein diets result in loss of large amounts of calcium in urine, so does lysine deficiency. Lysine may be an adjunct therapy because it reduces calcium losses in urine. Lysine deficiency also may result in immunodeficiency. Requirements for this amino acid are probably increased by stress. Lysine toxicity has not occurred with oral doses in humans. Lysine dosages are presently too small and may fail to reach the concentrations necessary to prove potential therapeutic applications. Lysine metabolites, amino caproic acid and carnitine have already shown their therapeutic potential. Thirty grams daily of amino caproic acid has been used as an initial daily dose in treating blood clotting disorders, indicating that the proper doses of lysine, its precursor, have yet to be used in medicine. Low lysine levels have been found in patients with Parkinson's, hypothyroidism, kidney disease, asthma and depression. The exact significance of these levels is unclear, yet lysine therapy can normalize the level and has been associated with improvement of some patients with these conditions. Abnormally elevated hydroxylysines have been found in virtually all chronic degenerative diseases and coumadin therapy. The levels of this stress marker may be improved by high doses of vitamin C. Lysine is particularly useful in therapy for marasmus (wasting) and herpes simplex. It stops the growth of herpes simplex in culture, and has helped to reduce the number and occurrence of cold sores in clinical studies. Dosing has not been adequately studied, but beneficial clinical effects occur in doses ranging from 100 mg to 4 g a day. Higher doses may also be useful, and toxicity has not been reported in doses as high as 8 g per day. Diets high in lysine and low in arginine can be useful in the prevention and treatment of herpes. Some researchers think herpes simplex virus is involved in many other diseases related to cranial nerves such as migraines, Bell's palsy and Meniere's disease.

It is a hypervalent molecule (the phosphorus atom has 10 electrons in its valence shell). A phosphate, in inorganic chemistry, is a salt of phosphoric acid. Phosphates are also important in biochemistry and biogeochemistry. In agriculture phosphate refers to one of the three primary plant nutrients, and it is a component of fertilizers. In ecological terms, because of its important role in biological systems, phosphate is a highly sought after resource. Consequently, it is often a limiting reagent in environments, and its availability may govern the rate of growth of organisms. Addition of high levels of phosphate to environments and to micro-environments in which it is typically rare can have significant ecological consequences.

M00222,,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): 1-(1Z-hexadecenyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphate is an intermediate of ether lipid metabolism. Ether lipids are lipids in which one or more of the carbon atoms on glycerol is bonded to an alkyl chain via an ether linkage, as opposed to the usual ester linkage. 1-(1Z-hexadecenyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphate is irreversibly produced from 1-(1Z-hexadecenyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine via the enzyme alkylglycerophosphoethanolamine phosphodiesterase (EC: 3.1.4.39). Plasmalogens are glycerol ether phospholipids. They are of two types, alkyl ether (-O-CH2-) and alkenyl ether (-O-CH=CH-). Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) serves as the glycerol precursor for the synthesis of plasmalogens. Three major classes of plasmalogens have been identified: choline, ethanolamine and serine derivatives. Ethanolamine plasmalogen is prevalent in myelin. Choline plasmalogen is abundant in cardiac tissue. Usually, the highest proportion of the plasmalogen form is in the ethanolamine class with rather less in choline, and commonly little or none in other phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol. In choline plasmalogens of most tissues, a higher proportion is often of the O-alkyl rather than the O-alkenyl form, but the reverse tends to be true in heart lipids. In animal tissues, the alkyl and alkenyl moieties in both non-polar and phospholipids tend to be rather simple in composition with 16:0, 18:0 and 18:1 (double bond in position 9) predominating. Ether analogues of triacylglycerols, i.e. 1-alkyldiacyl-sn-glycerols, are present at trace levels only if at all in most animal tissues, but they can be major components of some marine lipids.",LysoPA(P-16:0e/0:0),HMDB0011154,,,C15646,,FDB027929,,[H]O[C@]([H])(C([H])([H])O\C([H])=C(\[H])[*])C([H])([H])OP(=O)(O[H])O[H],1-(1Z-Hexadecenyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphate***LysoPA(DM16:0E)***LPA(P-16:0e/0:0),LBGSRVIXIVDRQM-OAXWQBPPSA-N,

Plasma 11beta-Hydroxyprogesterone concentrations does not vary significantly as a function of age, sex, or phase of the menstrual cycle, in contrast to 17-hydroxyprogesterone. Increased plasma 11beta-Hydroxyprogesterone levels in late-onset adrenal 21-hydroxylase deficiency suggest a mild defect of the mineralocorticoid pathway. 21-hydroxylase deficiency (OMIM 201910) is probably the most frequent (if not the most frequent) autosomal recessive genetic disease, occurring in almost 1% of Caucasians and about 3% of Ashkenazi Jews. 21-hydroxylase deficiency is unusual among genetic diseases in that approximately 95% of the mutant alleles have apparently been generated by recombination between a normally active gene (CYP21) and a closely linked pseudogene (CYP21P). There are 4 recognized clinical forms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, the majority of cases being associated with 21-hydroxylase deficiency: salt-wasting (SW), simple virilizing (SV), nonclassic (NC) late-onset (also called attenuated and acquired), and cryptic. (PMID: 3546944, 2537337). 11beta-hydroxyprogesterone acts as a mineralocorticoid agonist in stimulating Na+ absorption in mammalian principal cortical collecting duct cells.It activates the transiently expressed hMR in COS-7 cells in a dose-dependent manner (ED(50): 10(-8) M) and, like aldosterone, stimulated Ams I(sc) in mpkCCD(cl4) cells. Docking 11OHP within the hMR-ligand-binding domain homology model revealed that the agonist activity of 11OHP is caused by contacts between its 11 beta-hydroxyl group and Asn770. Furthermore, 11OHP was unable to activate the mutant hMR/N770A, in which Ala is substituted for Asn at position 770. These findings demonstrate that in the absence of the 21-hydroxyl group, the 11 beta-hydroxyl group can produce the contact with the hMR-Asn770 required for the hMR activation leading to stimulated Na(+) absorption.",11b-Hydroxyprogesterone,HMDB0004031,,,C05498,,FDB023284,M00285,[H]O[C@@]1([H])C([H])([H])[C@]2(C([H])([H])[H])[C@@]([H])(C(=O)C([H])([H])[H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C2([H])C2([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C3=C([H])C(=O)C([H])([H])C([H])([H])[C@]3(C([H])([H])[H])C12[H],"(11beta)-11-Hydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione***11-beta-Hydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione***11-beta-Hydroxyprogesterone***11beta-Hydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione***11beta-Hydroxyprogesterone***21-Deoxycorticosterone",BFZHCUBIASXHPK-GCEOMYSDSA-N,"InChI=1S/C21H30O3/c1-12(22)16-6-7-17-15-5-4-13-10-14(23)8-9-20(13,2)19(15)18(24)11-21(16,17)3/h10,15-19,24H,4-9,11H2,1-3H3/t15?,16-,17?,18+,19?,20+,21-/m0/s1"

M00603,641-77-0,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Plasma 21-deoxycortisol (21DF) is an excellent marker of 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Currently, it is the only marker able to detect heterozygous carriers with 21-hydroxylase deficiency after Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH) stimulation. The syndrome of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) comprises the spectrum of autosomal recessive enzymatic disorders that impair cortisol biosynthesis. The hormonal pattern and clinical manifestations result from hyperstimulation of the adrenal cortex by excessive production of ACTH, untied from the negative feedback exerted by reduced cortisol levels, and the ultimate accumulation of F precursors and androgens. These abnormalities predispose the female newborn to ambiguous genitalia (female pseudohermaphroditism) and precocious puberty that may occur in both sexes. CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21OHD) comprises nearly 90% of all cases, with an estimated worldwide incidence of 1 in 14,000 live births. Because 21-deoxycortisol (21DF) is an 11b-hydroxylase (11bOH) derivative of 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP), its serum levels are parallel and proportionally elevated in patients with 21OHD but decreased or undetectable in those with 11b-hydroxylase deficiency (11bOHD), another genetic disorder. Due to the marked buildup of 17OHP in 21OHD, this precursor steroid can proceed directly to 11-hydroxylation, producing distinct elevations of 21DF (PMID: 16551734, 10731638).",21-Deoxycortisol,HMDB0004030,,,C05497,,FDB023283,M00603,[H]O[C@@]1([H])C([H])([H])[C@@]2(C([H])([H])[H])C([H])(C([H])([H])C([H])([H])[C@]2(O[H])C(=O)C([H])([H])[H])C2([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C3=C([H])C(=O)C([H])([H])C([H])([H])[C@]3(C([H])([H])[H])C12[H],"11b,17-Dihydroxy-pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione***11b,17-Dihydroxy-progesterone***11b,17a-Dihydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione***11b,17a-Dihydroxyprogesterone***21-Dehydrohydrocortisone***21-Deoxyhydrocortisone***21-Desoxycortisol***4-Pregnene-11beta,17alpha-diol-3,20-dione***Pregn-4-ene-11b,17a-diol-3,20-dione",LCZBQMKVFQNSJR-AWYSGOOKSA-N,"InChI=1S/C21H30O4/c1-12(22)21(25)9-7-16-15-5-4-13-10-14(23)6-8-19(13,2)18(15)17(24)11-20(16,21)3/h10,15-18,24-25H,4-9,11H2,1-3H3/t15?,16?,17-,18?,19-,20-,21-/m0/s1"

M00627,,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): 2-(9Z,12Z-octadecadienoyl)-1-(1Z-hexadecenyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphate is an intermediate of ether lipid metabolism. Ether lipids are lipids in which one or more of the carbon atoms on glycerol is bonded to an alkyl chain via an ether linkage, as opposed to the usual ester linkage. 2-(9Z,12Z-octadecadienoyl)-1-(1Z-hexadecenyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphate is irreversibly produced from 2-(9Z,12Z-octadecadienoyl)-1-(1Z-hexadecenyl))-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine via the enzyme phospholipase D (EC: 3.1.4.4). Plasmalogens are glycerol ether phospholipids. They are of two types, alkyl ether (-O-CH2-) and alkenyl ether (-O-CH=CH-). Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) serves as the glycerol precursor for the synthesis of plasmalogens. Three major classes of plasmalogens have been identified: choline, ethanolamine and serine derivatives. Ethanolamine plasmalogen is prevalent in myelin. Choline plasmalogen is abundant in cardiac tissue. Usually, the highest proportion of the plasmalogen form is in the ethanolamine class with rather less in choline, and commonly little or none in other phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol. In choline plasmalogens of most tissues, a higher proportion is often of the O-alkyl rather than the O-alkenyl form, but the reverse tends to be true in heart lipids. In animal tissues, the alkyl and alkenyl moieties in both non-polar and phospholipids tend to be rather simple in composition with 16:0, 18:0 and 18:1 (double bond in position 9) predominating.

M00653,2889-31-8,17084,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): 2-Hydroxyglutarate exists in 2 isomers: L-2-hydroxyglutarate acid and D-2-hydroxyglutarate. Both the D and the L stereoisomers of hydroxyglutaric acid (EC 1.1.99.2) are found in body fluids. In humans it is part of butanoate metabolic pathway and can be produced by phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH). More specifically, the enzyme PHGDH catalyzes the NADH-dependent reduction of α-ketoglutarate (AKG) to D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG). 2-hydroxyglutarate is also the product of gain-of-function mutations in the cytosolic and mitochondrial isoforms of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH). Additionally, 2-hydroxyglutarate can be converted to α-ketoglutaric acid through the action of 2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (HGDH). Humans have to variants of this enzyme: D-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (D2HGDH) and L-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (L2HGDH). A deficiency in either of these two enzymes can lead to a disease known as 2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria. L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (caused by loss of L2HGDH) is chronic, with early symptoms such as hypotonia, tremors, and epilepsy declining into spongiform leukoencephalopathy, muscular choreodystonia, mental retardation, and psychomotor regression. D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (caused by loss of D2HGDH or gain of function of IDH) is rare, with symptoms including cancer, macrocephaly, cardiomyopathy, mental retardation, hypotonia, and cortical blindness. 2-hydroxyglutarate was the first oncometabolite (or cancer-causing metabolite) to be formally named or identified. In cancer it is either produced by overexpression of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) or is produced in excess by gain-of-function mutations in the cytosolic and mitochondrial isoforms of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH). IDH is part of TCA cycle and is generated in high abundance when IDH is mutated. 2-hydroxyglutarate is sufficiently similar in structure to 2-oxogluratate (2OG) that it is able to inhibit a range of 2OG-dependent dioxygenases, including histone lysine demethylases (KDMs) and members of the ten-eleven translocation (TET) family of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) hydroxylases. This inhibitory effect leads to alterations in the hypoxia induced factor (HIF)-mediated hypoxic response and alterations in gene expression through global epigenetic remodeling. The net effect is that 2-hydroxyglutarate causes a cascading effect that leads genetic perturbations and malignant transformation. Furthermore, 2-hydroxyglutarate is found to be associated with glutaric aciduria II, which is also an inborn error of metabolism.",2-Hydroxyglutarate,HMDB0059655,,,C02630,,,,[H]OC(=O)C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])(O[H])C(=O)O[H],"alpha-Hydroxyglutaric acid***a-Hydroxyglutarate***a-Hydroxyglutaric acid***alpha-Hydroxyglutarate***α-hydroxyglutarate***α-hydroxyglutaric acid***2-Hydroxyglutaric acid***D-2-Hydroxyglutarate***alpha-Hydroxyglutarate, (D)-isomer***alpha-Hydroxyglutarate, (DL)-isomer***alpha-Hydroxyglutarate, (L)-isomer***alpha-Hydroxyglutarate, disodium salt",HWXBTNAVRSUOJR-UHFFFAOYSA-N,"InChI=1S/C5H8O5/c6-3(5(9)10)1-2-4(7)8/h3,6H,1-2H2,(H,7,8)(H,9,10)"

It is involved in bile acid synthesis and is the second-to-last component in the synthesis of chenodeoxyglycocholate. 3a,7a-dihydroxy-5b-24-oxocholestanoyl-CoA is synthesized from 3a,7a,24-trihydroxy-5b-cholestanoyl-CoA and then transformed via acetyl-CoA acyltransferase to chenodeoxyglycocholoyl-CoA and then finally to chenodeoxyglycocholate. Chenodeoxyglycocholate is a glycine conjugated bile acid. Bile acids are steroid acids found predominantly in bile of mammals. The distinction between different bile acids is minute, depends only on presence or absence of hydroxyl groups on positions 3, 7, and 12. Bile acids are physiological detergents that facilitate excretion, absorption, and transport of fats and sterols in the intestine and liver. Bile acids are also steroidal amphipathic molecules derived from the catabolism of cholesterol. They modulate bile flow and lipid secretion, are essential for the absorption of dietary fats and vitamins, and have been implicated in the regulation of all the key enzymes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Bile acids recirculate through the liver, bile ducts, small intestine and portal vein to form an enterohepatic circuit. They exist as anions at physiological pH and, consequently, require a carrier for transport across the membranes of the enterohepatic tissues. The unique detergent properties of bile acids are essential for the digestion and intestinal absorption of hydrophobic nutrients. Bile acids have potent toxic properties (e.g., membrane disruption) and there are a plethora of mechanisms to limit their accumulation in blood and tissues.

Typically, THP (allopregnanolone) is released in the brain in response to stress, and quiets the neural system within 30 minutes of escalation. This steroid hormone has recently been found to be responsible for the extreme mood swings found in teenagers. In adults and pre-pubescent chlidren THP normally helps soothe the activity of brain cells by binding to GABA receptors that inhibit accelerating electrical activity. However, in pubescent teenagers THP actually becomes a GABA receptor antagonist. GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain with most sedatives (tranquilizers, anesthetics and alcohol) acting on the GABA receptor.",Allopregnanolone,HMDB0001449,,,C13712,,FDB022630,,[H]O[C@]1([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])[C@@]2(C([H])([H])[H])C([H])(C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C3([H])C4([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])[C@]([H])(C(=O)C([H])([H])[H])[C@@]4(C([H])([H])[H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C23[H])C1([H])[H],"(3alpha,5alpha)-3-Hydroxypregnan-20-one***3alpha-OH DHP***Allopregnan-3alpha-ol-20-one***(3a,5a)-3-Hydroxypregnan-20-one***(3α,5α)-3-hydroxypregnan-20-one***3a-OH DHP***3α-OH DHP***Allopregnan-3a-ol-20-one***Allopregnan-3α-ol-20-one***(+)-3a-Hydroxy-5a-pregnan-20-one***(3a)-Allopregnanolone***3-a-Tetrahydroprogesterone***3-alpha-Tetrahydroprogesterone***3a,5a-Pregnanolone***3a,5a-Tetrahydroprogesterone***3a,5a-THP***3a-Hydroxy-5a-dihydroprogesterone***3a-Hydroxy-5a-pregnan-20-one***3a-Hydroxy-5a-pregnane-20-one***5a-Pregnan-3a-ol-20-one***5a-Pregnane-3a-ol-20-one***Allotetrahydroprogesterone***3 alpha, 5 beta Tetrahydroprogesterone***Allopregnan 3 beta ol 20 one***Allopregnan-3 beta-ol-20-one***Pregnanolone, (3beta)-isomer***Pregnanolone, (3beta, 5alpha)-isomer***Pregnanolone, (3beta, 5beta,14beta)-isomer***beta-Ol-20-one, allopregnan-3***beta-Pregnan-20-one, 3 alpha-hydroxy-5***3 alpha Hydroxy 5 beta pregnan 20 one***3-Hydroxypregnan-20-one***3beta Hydroxy 5alpha pregnan 20 one***Eltanolone***Epipregnanolone***Pregnanolone***Pregnanolone, (3alpha,5alpha)-isomer***Pregnanolone, (3beta, 5alpha, 8alpha, 17beta)-isomer***alpha-Hydroxy-5 alpha-pregnan-20-one, 3***Pregnan-3alpha-ol-20-one***Pregnanolone, (3alpha)-isomer***Pregnanolone, (3beta, 5beta)-isomer***Pregnanolone, (3beta, 5beta, 17alpha)-isomer***Pregnanolone, (5alpha)-isomer***Sepranolone***3 Hydroxypregnan 20 one***3 alpha Hydroxy 5 alpha pregnan 20 one***3 alpha, 5 beta-Tetrahydroprogesterone***3 alpha-Hydroxy-5 alpha-pregnan-20-one***3 alpha-Hydroxy-5 beta-pregnan-20-one***3beta-Hydroxy-5alpha-pregnan-20-one***Pregnan 3alpha ol 20 one***Pregnanolone, (3alpha, 5beta, 17-alpha)-isomer***Pregnanolone, (3alpha,5beta)-isomer***Pregnanolone, (3beta, 5alpha, 17alpha)-isomer***alpha-Hydroxy-5 beta-pregnan-20-one, 3***alpha-Pregnan-20-one, 3 alpha-hydroxy-5",AURFZBICLPNKBZ-FOONYZIMSA-N,"InChI=1S/C21H34O2/c1-13(22)17-6-7-18-16-5-4-14-12-15(23)8-10-20(14,2)19(16)9-11-21(17,18)3/h14-19,23H,4-12H2,1-3H3/t14?,15-,16?,17-,18?,19?,20+,21-/m0/s1"

M00819,534-82-7,846276,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Vanylglycol (MHPG) is a O-methylated metabolite of normetanephrine. MHPG is formed by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) from norepinephrine. Catecholamines play an important role in platelet activation and aggregation, epinephrine being the most potent one. Catecholamines are substantially increased during stress, exercise or smoking and could result in clinically important platelet activation if their action was not rapidly regulated. MHPG is found normally in urine, in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. Alcohol consumption increases the level of HMPG in urine and CSF. Alcohol dehydrogenase has been shown to act on norepinephrine and produce HMPG (PMID: 11958479, 9706478, 7735466, 2455302). Vanylglycol is found to be associated with aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency and sepiapterin reductase deficiency, which are inborn errors of metabolism.",Vanylglycol,HMDB0001490,,,C05594,,FDB022651,,[H]OC1=C([H])C([H])=C(C([H])=C1OC([H])([H])[H])C([H])(O[H])C([H])([H])O[H],"1-(4-Hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1,2-ethanediol***3-Methoxy-4-hydroxyphenethylene glycol***3-Methoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl glycol***4-Hydroxy-3-methoxy-b-phenylglycol***4-Hydroxy-3-methoxy-beta-phenylglycol***4-Hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl glycol***HMPG***Hydroxymethoxyphenylglycol***Methoxyhydroxyphenylglycol***MHPG***MOPEG***4 Hydroxy 3 methoxyphenylethyleneglycol***4 Hydroxy 3 methoxyphenylglycol***4-Hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylethyleneglycol***Methoxyhydroxyphenylglycol, (-)-isomer***4 Hydroxy 3 methoxyphenylethylene glycol***4-Hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylglycol***Methoxyhydroxyphenylglycol, (+)-isomer***4-Hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylethylene glycol***Methoxyhydroxyphenylglycol, (+-)-isomer",FBWPWWWZWKPJFL-UHFFFAOYSA-N,"InChI=1S/C9H12O4/c1-13-9-4-6(8(12)5-10)2-3-7(9)11/h2-4,8,10-12H,5H2,1H3"

The cardiovascular and plasma renin activity (PRA) changes are less prominent for 6-keto-PGE1 than PGI2. Salt loading slightly increases urinary 6-keto PGE1. 6-keto-PGE1 elicits the same biological effects as PGI2 in human platelets and in rabbit aorta and mesenteric artery, being, however, less potent. 6-keto-PGE1 dose-dependently stimulates adenylate cyclase activity in membranes of human platelets and cultured myocytes from rabbit aorta and mesenteric artery. The extent of stimulation of the enzyme by 6-keto-PGE1 is the same as elicited by PGI2, while the apparent affinity is lower than that of prostacyclin, both in platelets and in vascular smooth muscle cells. At the level of platelet membranes, 6-keto-PGE1 interacts with the binding sites labelled by PGI2. However, in platelets as well as in mesenteric artery myocytes, 6-keto-PGE1 interacts with only one class of sites as demonstrated either by binding or by adenylate cyclase studies, whereas PGI2 in the same conditions recognizes two different classes. (PMID: 3186779, 3075239, 3472253, 3912001, 3881881, 6391491)Prostaglandins are eicosanoids. The eicosanoids consist of the prostaglandins (PGs), thromboxanes (TXs), leukotrienes (LTs) and lipoxins (LXs). The PGs and TXs are collectively identified as prostanoids. Prostaglandins were originally shown to be synthesized in the prostate gland, thromboxanes from platelets (thrombocytes) and leukotrienes from leukocytes, hence the derivation of their names. All mammalian cells except erythrocytes synthesize eicosanoids. These molecules are extremely potent, able to cause profound physiological effects at very dilute concentrations.

M01341,62-53-3,17296,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Aniline is an organic chemical compound, specifically a primary aromatic amine. It consists of a benzene ring attached to an amino group. Aniline is oily and, although colorless, it can be slowly oxidized and resinified in air to form impurities which can give it a red-brown tint. Its boiling point is 184 degree centigrade and its melting point is -6 degree centegrade. It is a liquid at room temperature. Like most volatile amines, it possesses a somewhat unpleasant odour of rotten fish, and also has a burning aromatic taste; it is a highly acrid poison. It ignites readily, burning with a large smoky flame. Aniline reacts with strong acids to form salts containing the anilinium (or phenylammonium) ion (C6H5-NH3+), and reacts with acyl halides (such as acetyl chloride (ethanoyl chloride), CH3COCl) to form amides. The amides formed from aniline are sometimes called anilides, for example CH3-CO-NH-C6H5 is acetanilide, for which the modern name is N-phenyl ethanamide. Like phenols, aniline derivatives are highly reactive in electrophilic substitution reactions. For example, sulfonation of aniline produces sulfanilic acid, which can be converted to sulfanilamide. Sulfanilamide is one of the sulfa drugs which were widely used as antibacterial in the early 20th century. Aniline was first isolated from the destructive distillation of indigo in 1826 by Otto Unverdorben. In 1834, Friedrich Runge isolated from coal tar a substance which produced a beautiful blue color on treatment with chloride of lime; this he named kyanol or cyanol. In 1841, C. J. Fritzsche showed that by treating indigo with caustic potash it yielded an oil, which he named aniline, from the specific name of one of the indigo-yielding plants, Indigofera anil, anil being derived from the Sanskrit, dark-blue.",Aniline,HMDB0003012,,,C00292,34-DICHLOROANILINE,FDB003571,,[H]N([H])C1=C([H])C([H])=C([H])C([H])=C1[H],"Aminobenzene***Aminophen***Anilin***Benzenamine***Benzeneamine***Kyanol***Phenylamine***Anilina***Aniline hydrobromide***Aniline reagent***Anyvim***Arylamine***Benzidam***Cyanol***D'Aniline***Krystallin***Aniline diphosphate (3:1)***Aniline hydrogen iodide***Aniline phosphate (1:2)***Aniline phosphate (2:1)***Aniline sulfate***Aniline, 3-(13)C-labeled CPD***Aniline aluminium salt***Aniline diphosphate (4:1)***Aniline hydrochloride-(15)N-labeled CPD***Aniline hydrofluoride***Aniline monosulfate***Aniline nitrate***Aniline sulfate (2:1)***Aniline, 2-(13)C-labeled CPD***Aniline, conjugate acid***Aniline, sodium salt***Aniline dihydrofluoride***Aniline diphosphate (1:1)***Aniline hydrochloride***Aniline hydrochloride-(14)C-labeled CPD***Aniline perchlorate***Aniline phosphonate (1:1)***Aniline, (13)C-labeled CPD***Aniline, (14)C-labeled CPD***Aniline, 4-(13)C-labeled CPD***Aniline, ion(1+)***Aniline, monolithium salt***Aniline phosphate (1:1)***Aniline sulfate (2:1), (14)C-labeled CPD***Aniline, 15N-labeled CPD***Aniline, 3H-labeled CPD***Aniline, magnesium (1:1) salt",PAYRUJLWNCNPSJ-UHFFFAOYSA-N,"InChI=1S/C6H7N/c7-6-4-2-1-3-5-6/h1-5H,7H2"

M01360,56432-02-1,27775,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Diadenosine triphosphate (AP3A) is a diadenosine polyphosphate. Diadenosine polyphosphates (APnAs, n = 3-6) are a family of endogenous vasoactive purine dinucleotides which have been isolated from thrombocytes. APnAs have been demonstrated to be involved in the control of vascular tone as well as the growth of vascular smooth muscle cells and hence, possibly, in atherogenesis. APnAs isolated substances are Ap3A, Ap4A, Ap5A, and Ap6A. APnAs are naturally occurring substances that facilitate tear secretion; they are released from the corneal epithelium, they stimulate tear production and therefore they may be considered as physiological modulators of tear secretion. The APnAs were discovered in the mid-sixties in the course of studies on aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS). APnAs have emerged as intracellular and extracellular signalling molecules implicated in the maintenance and regulation of vital cellular functions and become considered as second messengers. Great variety of physiological and pathological effects in mammalian cells was found to be associated with alterations of APnAs. APnAs are polyphosphated nucleotidic substances which are found in the CNS and are known to be released in a calcium-dependent manner from storage vesicles in brain synaptosomes. AP3A is a primer for oligoadenylate synthesis catalyzed by interferon-inducible 2-5A synthetase. AP3A is synthesized in cells by tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WRS); cellular level of AP3A significantly increases after interferon treatment. AP3A is an avid inhibitor of eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN). EDN is a catalytically proficient member of the pancreatic ribonuclease superfamily secreted along with other eosinophil granule proteins during innate host defense responses and various eosinophil-related inflammatory and allergic diseases. The ribonucleolytic activity of EDN is central to its antiviral and neurotoxic activities and possibly to other facets of its biological activity. AP3A accumulates in cells in response to various physiological factors. AP3A FHIT (Fragile histidine Triad) is a human tumor suppressor gene. The Fhit protein is believed to inhibit tumor growth by inducing apoptosis through interaction with AP3A.

M01388,492-61-5,15903,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Beta-D-Glucose is a primary source of energy for living organisms. It is naturally occurring and is found in fruits and other parts of plants in its free state. It is used therapeutically in fluid and nutrient replacement. A glucoside is a glycoside that is derived from glucose. Glucosides are common in plants, but rare in animals. Glucose is produced when a glucoside is hydrolysed by purely chemical means, or decomposed by fermentation or enzymes. This group contains a benzene and also an ethylene group, being derived from styrolene. Coniferin, C16H22O8, occurs in the cambium of conifer wood. Emulsin converts it into glucose and coniferyl alcohol, while oxidation gives glycovanillin, which yields with emulsin glucose and vanillin. Syringin, which occurs in the bark of Syringe vulgaris, is a methoxyconiferin. Phloridzus occurs in the root-bark of various fruit trees; it hydrolyses to glucose and phloretin, which is the phloroglucin ester of paraoxyhydratropic acid. It is related to the pentosides naringin, C21HEOi1, which hydrolyses to rhamnose and naringenin, the phioroglucin ester of para-oxycinnamic acid, and hesperidin, which hydrolyses to rhamnose and hesperetin, the phloroglucin ester of meta-oxy-para-methoxycinnamic acid or isoferulic acid, C10H10O4. Classification of the glucosides is a matter of some difficulty. One based on the chemical constitution of the non-glucose part of the molecules has been proposed that frames four groups: (I) ethylene derivatives, (2) benzene derivatives, (3) styrolene derivatives, (4) anthracene derivatives. A group may also be made to include the cyanogenetic glucosides, i.e. those containing prussic acid. Other classifications follow a botanical classification, which has several advantages; in particular, plants of allied genera contain similar compounds.

M01436,1398-61-4,17029,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Chitin is one of the main components in the cell walls of fungi, the exoskeletons of insects and other arthropods (such as crustaceans) as well as fish and frogs. It is a polysaccharide that is constructed from units of acetylglucosamine (more completely, N-acetyl-D-glucose-2-amine). These are linked together in beta-1,4 fashion (in a similar manner to the glucose units which form cellulose). In effect, chitin may be described as cellulose with one hydroxyl group on each monomer replaced by an acetylamine group. This allows for increased hydrogen bonding between adjacent polymers, giving the polymer increased strength. Chitin is the second most abundant polysaccharide in the world (after cellulose). Chitinases break down chitin and are a part of the defence mechanism of mammals against chitin-containing parasites in lower life forms. Under certain circumstances, chitin can act as an allergen. Research using murine models has shown that chitin is a size-dependent microbial-associated molecular pattern (MAMP) that can induce an immunological response via pattern recognition receptors. Medium-sized chitin micro-particles (CMPs) have been shown to induce inflammation, while small-sized CMPs reduce inflammation. Additionally, mammalian chitinases may play a key role in mediating the T-helper 2 cell-driven inflammatory response that is commonly associated with asthma. The high prevalence of asthma among people working with chitinous substances, such as crabs and fungi, suggests that chitin might be an allergen playing a significant role in the development of asthma.",Chitin,HMDB0003362,,,C00461,14-N-ACETYL-BETA-D-GLUCOSAMINYLN1,FDB023154,,[H]OC([H])([H])[C@@]1([H])O[C@@]([H])(-*)[C@]([H])(N([H])C(=O)C([H])([H])[H])[C@@]([H])(O[H])[C@]1([H])O-*,"(beta)-N,N',n''-triacetyl chitotriose***beta-D-GlcNAc-(1->4)-beta-D-glcnac-(1->4)-beta-D-glcnac***beta-N,N',n''-triacetylchitotriose***GlcNAcb1-4glcnacb1-4glcnacb***GlcNAcbeta1-4glcnacbeta1-4glcnacbeta***N,N',n''-triacetyl chitotriose beta-anomer***N-Acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine***(b)-N,N',n''-triacetyl chitotriose***(β)-N,n',n''-triacetyl chitotriose***b-D-GlcpNAc-(1->4)-b-D-glcpnac-(1->4)-b-D-glcpnac***β-D-glcpnac-(1->4)-β-D-glcpnac-(1->4)-β-D-glcpnac***b-D-GlcNAc-(1->4)-b-D-glcnac-(1->4)-b-D-glcnac***β-D-glcnac-(1->4)-β-D-glcnac-(1->4)-β-D-glcnac***b-N,N',n''-triacetylchitotriose***β-N,n',n''-triacetylchitotriose***N,N',n''-triacetyl chitotriose b-anomer***N,N',n''-triacetyl chitotriose β-anomer***N-Acetyl-b-D-glucosaminyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-b-D-glucosaminyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-b-D-glucosamine***N-Acetyl-β-D-glucosaminyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-β-D-glucosamine",DJHJJVWPFGHIPH-OODMECLYSA-N,

M01677,9004-53-9,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Dextrins are a group of low-molecular-weight carbohydrates produced by the hydrolysis of starch. Dextrins are mixtures of linear &#945;-(1,4)-linked D-glucose polymers starting with an &#945;-(1,6) bond. Because branched amylopectin and glycogen also contain &#945;-(1,6) bonds, which &#945;-amylase cannot hydrolyze in humans, the digest resulting from this action contains a mixture of dextrins. They have the same general formula as carbohydrates but are of shorter chain length. Industrial production is, in general, performed by acidic hydrolysis of potato starch. Dextrins are water-soluble, white to slightly yellow solids that are optically active. Under analysis, dextrins can be detected with iodine solution, giving a red coloration. The cyclical dextrins are known as cyclodextrins. They are formed by enzymatic degradation of starch by certain bacteria, for example, Bacillus macerans. Cyclodextrins have toroidal structures formed by 6-8 glucose residues. Dextrins find widespread use in industry, due to their non-toxicity and their low price. They are used as water-soluble glues, as thickening agents in food processing, and as binding agent in pharmaceuticals. In pyrotechnics, they are added to fire formulas, allowing them to solidify as pellets or ""stars."" Cyclodextrins find additional use in analytical chemistry as a matrix for the separation of hydrophobic substances, and as excipients in pharmaceutical formulations. Not all forms of dextrin are digestible, and indigestible dextrin is sometimes used in fiber supplements. For example, maltodextrin either can be moderately sweet or have hardly any flavor at all. Maltodextrin is a polysaccharide that is used as a food additive. It is produced from starch and is usually found as a creamy-white hygroscopic powder. Maltodextrin is easily digestible, being absorbed as rapidly as glucose. The CAS registry number of maltodextrin is 9050-36-6. Maltodextrin can be derived from any starch. In the US, this starch is usually rice, corn or potato; elsewhere, such as in Europe, it is commonly wheat. This is important for coeliacs, since the wheat-derived maltodextrin can contain traces of gluten. There have been recent reports of coeliac reaction to maltodextrin in the United States. This might be a consequence of the shift of corn to ethanol production and its replacement with wheat in the formulation. The fast food chain, Wendy's, footnotes maltodextrin in its list of gluten-free foods [1], which may be a sign of their receiving reports of this. Foods containing maltodextrin may contain traces of amino acids, including glutamic acid as a manufacturing by-product. The amino acid traces would be too small to have any dietary significance.(Wikipedia).",Dextrin,HMDB0006857,,,C00721,,FDB012148,,[H]OC([H])([H])[C@@]1([H])O[C@]([H])(O[C@@]2([H])[C@]([H])(O[H])[C@@]([H])(O[H])[C@@]([H])(O-*)O[C@]2([H])C([H])([H])O[H])[C@]([H])(O[H])[C@@]([H])(O[H])[C@]1([H])-*,British gum***Caloreen***Corn dextrin***Crystal gum***Dextrid***Dextrina bianca***Dextrine***Dextrins***Fortodex,FYGDTMLNYKFZSV-MRCIVHHJSA-N,

M01966,10139-18-1,18148,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Glucose 1,6-diphosphate (G-1,6-P2) is considered to be a major regulator of carbohydrate metabolism. It has been demonstrated that G-1,6-P2 is a potent activator (deinhibitor) of skeletal muscle phosphofructokinase (PFK) and phosphoglucomutase, while being an inhibitor of hexokinase (see Ref. 2). In addition, G-1,6-P2 has been shown to inhibit 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase in various rat tissues and fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase in bovine liver. Various factors and conditions affect the tissue content of G-1,6-P2. Specifically, anoxia induce a rapid fall in the content of G-l,6-P2 in brain. Glucose 1,6-diphosphate have been recognized as a regulatory signal implicated in the control of metabolism, oxygen affinity of red cells and other cellular functions. The levels of G 1,6-P2 are reduced in the liver and in the muscle of rats with experimentally induced diabetes. In muscle of genetically dystrophic mice a decrease in the levels of G 1,6-P2 has been found, probably resulting from enhancement of glucose 1,6-P2 phosphatase activity. G 1,6-P2 is an inhibitor of hexokinase and its level is increased significantly after 5 min of exercise (~ 25%) and then decreased continuously. G 1,6-P2 is a potent allosteric activator of phosphofructokinase, and is markedly decreased in muscles of patients with glycogenosis type VII (muscle phosphofructokinase deficiency) and type V (muscle phosphorylase deficiency). Chronic alcohol intake produces an increase in the concentration of G 1,6-P2 in human muscle before the first sign of myopathy appears. When myopathy is present the level decreases to be similar of healthy humans. These changes could contribute to the decline in skeletal muscle performance.

M02107,,37283,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Heptanoyl-CoA is an acyl-CoA with the C-7 fatty acid Acyl chain moiety. Acyl-CoA (or formyl-CoA) is a coenzyme involved in the metabolism of fatty acids. It is a temporary compound formed when coenzyme A (CoA) attaches to the end of a long-chain fatty acid, inside living cells. The CoA is then removed from the chain, carrying two carbons from the chain with it, forming acetyl-CoA. This is then used in the citric acid cycle to start a chain of reactions, eventually forming many adenosine triphosphates. To be oxidatively degraded, a fatty acid must first be activated in a two-step reaction catalyzed by acyl-CoA synthetase. First, the fatty acid displaces the diphosphate group of ATP, then coenzyme A (HSCoA) displaces the AMP group to form an Acyl-CoA. The acyladenylate product of the first step has a large free energy of hydrolysis and conserves the free energy of the cleaved phosphoanhydride bond in ATP. The second step, transfer of the acyl group to CoA (the same molecule that carries acetyl groups as acetyl-CoA), conserves free energy in the formation of a thioester bond. Consequently, the overall reaction Fatty acid + CoA + ATP <=> Acyl-CoA + AMP + PPi has a free energy change near zero. Subsequent hydrolysis of the product PPi (by the enzyme inorganic pyrophosphatase) is highly exergonic, and this reaction makes the formation of acyl-CoA spontaneous and irreversible. Fatty acids are activated in the cytosol, but oxidation occurs in the mitochondria. Because there is no transport protein for CoA adducts, acyl groups must enter the mitochondria via a shuttle system involving the small molecule carnitine.",Heptanoyl-CoA,HMDB0012969,,,,CPD-10054,FDB029227,M02107,[H]O[C@@]([H])(C(=O)N([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C(=O)N([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])SC(=O)C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])[H])C(C([H])([H])[H])(C([H])([H])[H])C([H])([H])OP(=O)(O[H])OP(=O)(O[H])OC([H])([H])[C@@]1([H])O[C@@]([H])(N2C([H])=NC3=C2N=C([H])N=C3N([H])[H])[C@]([H])(O[H])[C@]1([H])OP(=O)(O[H])O[H],"2-Methyloctanoyl CoA, 21***2-Methyloctanoyl coenzyme A, 21",CHVYGJMBUXUTSX-SVHODSNWSA-N,"InChI=1S/C28H48N7O17P3S/c1-4-5-6-7-8-19(37)56-12-11-30-18(36)9-10-31-26(40)23(39)28(2,3)14-49-55(46,47)52-54(44,45)48-13-17-22(51-53(41,42)43)21(38)27(50-17)35-16-34-20-24(29)32-15-33-25(20)35/h15-17,21-23,27,38-39H,4-14H2,1-3H3,(H,30,36)(H,31,40)(H,44,45)(H,46,47)(H2,29,32,33)(H2,41,42,43)/t17-,21-,22-,23+,27-/m1/s1"

M02144,7647-01-0,17883,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Hydrochloric acid constitutes the majority of gastric acid, the human digestive fluid. In a complex process and at a large energetic burden, it is secreted by parietal cells (also known as oxyntic cells). These cells contain an extensive secretory network (called canaliculi) from which the HCl is secreted into the lumen of the stomach. They are part of the epithelial fundic glands (also known as oxyntic glands) in the stomach. The chemical compound hydrochloric acid is the aqueous (water-based) solution of hydrogen chloride gas (HCl). It is a strong acid, the major component of gastric acid and of wide industrial use. Hydrochloric acid must be handled with appropriate safety precautions because it is a highly corrosive liquid. Hydrochloric acid, or muriatic acid by its historical but still occasionally used name, has been an important and frequently used chemical from early history and was discovered by the alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan around the year 800. Hydrogen chloride, also known under the name HCl, is a highly corrosive and toxic colorless gas that forms white fumes on contact with humidity. These fumes consist of hydrochloric acid which forms when hydrogen chloride dissolves in water. The hydrogen chloride molecule HCl is a simple diatomic molecule consisting of a hydrogen atom H and a chlorine atom Cl connected with a covalent single bond. Since the chlorine atom is much more electronegative than the hydrogen atom, the covalent bond between the atoms is quite polar. Hydrogen chloride forms corrosive hydrochloric acid on contact with body tissue. Inhalation of the fumes can cause coughing, choking, inflammation of the nose, throat, and upper respiratory tract, and in severe cases, pulmonary edema, circulatory system failure, and death. Skin contact can cause redness, pain, and severe skin burns.

M02382,7439-93-2,49713,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Lithium (Li) is an alkali metal. First described as a mood stabilizer in 1949, it remains an efficacious treatment for bipolar disorders. Recent emerging evidence of its neuroprotective and neurogenic effects alludes to lithium's potential therapeutic use in stroke and neurodegenerative diseases. One intriguing clinical application is in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating lithium's abilities to lower tau and beta-amyloid levels in cerebrospinal fluid in Alzheimer's patients. Lithium reduces brain inositol levels by inhibiting the enzyme inositol monophosphatase. This suggests that inositol monophosphatase inhibition is a key mechanism of Li's therapeutic action and that design of new inositol monophosphatase inhibitors may be a practical strategy to create new compounds with Li-like therapeutic effects. Lithium reduces the severity of some behavioral complications of Alzheimer's disease (AD). And there are growing indications that Li may be of benefit to the underlying pathology of AD, as well as an array of other common CNS disorders, including stroke, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. Physiologically, it exists as an ion in the body. Despite these demonstrated and prospective therapeutic benefits, Li's mechanism of action remains elusive, and opinions differ regarding the most relevant molecular targets. Lithium inhibits several enzymes; significant among these are inositol monophosphatase (IMPase), glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), and the proteasome. Lithium has a narrow therapeutic range, and several well characterised adverse effects limit the potential usefulness of higher doses. Acute ingestion in Li-naive patients is generally associated with only short-lived exposure to high concentrations, due to extensive distribution of Li throughout the total body water compartment. Conversely, chronic toxicity and acute-on-therapeutic ingestion are associated with prolonged exposure to higher tissue concentrations and, therefore, greater toxicity. Lithium toxicity may be life threatening, or result in persistent cognitive and neurological impairment. Therefore, enhanced Li clearance has been explored as a means of minimizing exposure to high tissue concentrations. Although haemodialysis is highly effective in removing circulating Li, serum concentrations often rebound so repeated or prolonged treatment may be required. Continuous arteriovenous haemodiafiltration and continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration increase Li clearance, albeit to a lesser extent than haemodialysis, and are more widely accessible. Lithium reduces brain inositol levels by inhibiting IMPase, suggesting that IMPase's inhibition is a key mechanism of Li's therapeutic action and that design of new IMPase inhibitors may be a practical strategy to create new compounds with Li-like therapeutic effects.

M02474,124-58-3,29852,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Methylarsonate is used as a contact herbicide in either the monosodium or disodium salt form. It goes by the trade names Weed-E-Rad, Ansar 170 H.C., Ansar 529 H.C., DiTac and others. Methylarsonate is considered only slightly toxic, having an oral LD50 of 2200 mg/Kg for rats. The inhalation risk is greater with LD50 Rats >20 mg. Long term studies with people exposed to organoarsenicals has shown an increased risk of skin cancer (Spiewak, 2001), lung cancer and some liver cancers, although some recent studies have shown some arsenic containing compounds (specifically Arsine trioxide) may have anticarcinogenic properties (Wang, 2001). In mammals, Methylarsonate is also an intermediate in the detoxification of inorganic arsenic. In the arsenate detoxification I pathway, arsenite reacts with S-adenosyl-L-methionine to produce methylarsonate and S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine. Arsenite methyltransferase catalyzes this reaction. Methylarsonate then reacts with 2 glutathione molecules to produce glutathione disulfide and methylarsonite. This reaction is catalyzed by methylarsonate reductase. Methylarsonate is an organic arsenic compound with adverse effects similar to those of arsenic trioxide. Arsenic is found in the environment primarily as arsenate and arsenite species. Arsenate is reduced to arsenite by arsenate reductase and can be subsequently methylated to Methylarsonate.

M02488,73508-07-3,21437,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Molybdenum cofactor is a cofactor required for the activity of enzymes such as sulfite oxidase, xanthine oxidoreductase, and aldehyde oxidase. It is a coordination complex formed between molybdopterin (which, despite the name, does not contain molybdenum) and an oxide of molybdenum. Molybdopterins, in turn, are synthesized from guanosine triphosphate. Molybdenum cofactor functions directly in ethylbenzene dehydrogenase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate ferredoxin oxidoreductase, and respiratory arsenate reductase. In animals and plants these enzymes use molybdenum bound at the active site in a tricyclic molybdenum cofactor. All molybdenum-using enzymes so far identified in nature use this cofactor The simplest structure of molybdopterin contains a pyranopterin coordinated to molybdenum. The pyranopterin structure is a fused ring system containing a pyran fused to pterin. In addition, the pyran ring is substituted with two thiols and an alkyl phosphate. In molybdopterin, the thiols coordinate to molybdenum. In some cases, the alkyl phosphate group is replaced by an alkyl diphosphate nucleotide. -- Wikipedia.",Molybdopterin,HMDB0002206,,,C05924,CPD0-1882,FDB022906,,[H]OP(=O)(O[H])OC([H])([H])[C@@]1([H])OC2([H])N([H])C3=C(N([H])C2([H])C(S[H])=C1S[H])C(=O)N([H])C(=N3)N([H])[H],,HPEUEJRPDGMIMY-VISFTIJFSA-L,"InChI=1S/C10H14N5O6PS2/c11-10-14-7-4(8(16)15-10)12-3-6(24)5(23)2(21-9(3)13-7)1-20-22(17,18)19/h2-3,9,12,23-24H,1H2,(H2,17,18,19)(H4,11,13,14,15,16)/p-2/t2-,3?,9?/m0/s1"

Nitrogen occurs in all living organisms. It is a constituent element of amino acids and therefore of proteins and nucleic acids (DNA and RNA). Nitrogen is found in the chemical structure of almost all neurotransmitters and is a key component of alkaloids. Specific bacteria (e.g. Rhizobium trifolium) possess nitrogenase enzymes which can fix atmospheric nitrogen into a form (ammonium ion) which is chemically useful to higher organisms. Animals use nitrogen-containing amino acids from plant sources, as starting materials for all nitrogen-compound animal biochemistry, including the manufacture of proteins and nucleic acids. Animal metabolism of NO (nitric oxide) results in production of nitrite. Animal metabolism of nitrogen in proteins generally results in excretion of urea, while animal metabolism of nucleic acids results in excretion of urea and uric acid. The characteristic odor of animal flesh decay is caused by nitrogen-containing long-chain amines, such as putrescine and cadaverine. Decay of organisms and their waste products may produce small amounts of nitrate, but most decay eventually returns nitrogen content to the atmosphere, as molecular nitrogen. The circulation of nitrogen from the atmosphere through organics and then back to the atmosphere is commonly referred to as the nitrogen cycle. Nitrogen can be measured in urine with the Kjeldahl method or by spectrophotometric methods (enzymic tests).

M02616,17331-98-5,27770,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Nonanoyl CoA is an acyl-CoA with the C-9 fatty acid Acyl chain moiety. Acyl-CoA (or formyl-CoA) is a coenzyme involved in the metabolism of fatty acids. It is a temporary compound formed when coenzyme A (CoA) attaches to the end of a long-chain fatty acid, inside living cells. The CoA is then removed from the chain, carrying two carbons from the chain with it, forming acetyl-CoA. This is then used in the citric acid cycle to start a chain of reactions, eventually forming many adenosine triphosphates. To be oxidatively degraded, a fatty acid must first be activated in a two-step reaction catalyzed by acyl-CoA synthetase. First, the fatty acid displaces the diphosphate group of ATP, then coenzyme A (HSCoA) displaces the AMP group to form an Acyl-CoA. The acyladenylate product of the first step has a large free energy of hydrolysis and conserves the free energy of the cleaved phosphoanhydride bond in ATP. The second step, transfer of the acyl group to CoA (the same molecule that carries acetyl groups as acetyl-CoA), conserves free energy in the formation of a thioester bond. Consequently, the overall reaction Fatty acid + CoA + ATP <=> Acyl-CoA + AMP + PPi has a free energy change near zero. Subsequent hydrolysis of the product PPi (by the enzyme inorganic pyrophosphatase) is highly exergonic, and this reaction makes the formation of acyl-CoA spontaneous and irreversible. Fatty acids are activated in the cytosol, but oxidation occurs in the mitochondria. Because there is no transport protein for CoA adducts, acyl groups must enter the mitochondria via a shuttle system involving the small molecule carnitine.",Nonanoyl-CoA,HMDB0013028,,,C01942,CPD-7302,FDB029254,M02616,[H]OC([H])(C(=O)N([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C(=O)N([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])SC(=O)C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])[H])C(C([H])([H])[H])(C([H])([H])[H])C([H])([H])OP(=O)(O[H])OP(=O)(O[H])OC([H])([H])[C@@]1([H])O[C@@]([H])(N2C([H])=NC3=C2N=C([H])N=C3N([H])[H])[C@]([H])(O[H])[C@]1([H])OP(=O)(O[H])O[H],coenzyme A S-Nonanoate***coenzyme A S-Nonanoic acid***Nonanoyl-coenzyme A,WLDUTYVSAGSKIV-YUXRTGJASA-N,"InChI=1S/C30H52N7O17P3S/c1-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-21(39)58-14-13-32-20(38)11-12-33-28(42)25(41)30(2,3)16-51-57(48,49)54-56(46,47)50-15-19-24(53-55(43,44)45)23(40)29(52-19)37-18-36-22-26(31)34-17-35-27(22)37/h17-19,23-25,29,40-41H,4-16H2,1-3H3,(H,32,38)(H,33,42)(H,46,47)(H,48,49)(H2,31,34,35)(H2,43,44,45)/t19-,23-,24-,25?,29-/m1/s1"

However, the excretion of certain acyl glycines is increased in several inborn errors of metabolism. In certain cases the measurement of these metabolites in body fluids can be used to diagnose disorders associated with mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation. Acyl glycines are produced through the action of glycine N-acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.13) which is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction:. acyl-CoA + glycine < -- > CoA + N-acylglycine. Phenylacetylglycine or PAG is a glycine conjugate of phenylacetic acid. Phenylacetic acid may arise from exposure to styrene (plastic) or through the consumption of fruits and vegetables. Phenylacetic acid is used in some perfumes, possessing a honey-like odour in low concentrations, and is also used in penicillin G production. PAG is a putative biomarker of phospholipidosis. Urinary PAG is elevated in animals exhibiting abnormal phospholipid accumulation in many tissues and may thus be useful as a surrogate biomarker for phospholipidosis.

M02807,1157-60-4,18116,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Pseudouridine (5-ribosyluracil) is a ubiquitous yet enigmatic constituent of structural RNAs (transfer, ribosomal, small nuclear, and small nucleolar). Although pseudouridine (psi) was the first modified nucleoside to be discovered in RNA, and is the most abundant, its biosynthesis and biological roles have remained poorly understood since its identification as a ""fifth nucleoside"" in RNA. Recently, a combination of biochemical, biophysical, and genetic approaches has helped to illuminate the structural consequences of psi in polyribonucleotides, the biochemical mechanism of U-->psi isomerization in RNA, and the role of modification enzymes (psi synthases) and box H/ACA snoRNAs, a class of eukaryotic small nucleolar RNAs, in the site-specific biosynthesis of psi. Through its unique ability to coordinate a structural water molecule via its free N1-H, psi exerts a subtle but significant ""rigidifying"" influence on the nearby sugar-phosphate backbone and also enhances base stacking. These effects may underlie the biological role of most (but perhaps not all) of the psi residues in RNA. Certain genetic mutants lacking specific psi residues in tRNA or rRNA exhibit difficulties in translation, display slow growth rates, and fail to compete effectively with wild-type strains in mixed culture. In particular, normal growth is severely compromised in an Escherichia coli mutant deficient in a pseudouridine synthase responsible for the formation of three closely spaced psi residues in the mRNA decoding region of the 23S rRNA. Such studies demonstrate that pseudouridylation of RNA confers an important selective advantage in a natural biological context.

M02957,,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): TG(16:0/16:0/18:0) is a dipalmitic acid triglyceride. Triglycerides (TGs) are also known as triacylglycerols or triacylglycerides, meaning that they are glycerides in which the glycerol is esterified with three fatty acid groups (i.e. fatty acid tri-esters of glycerol). TGs may be divided into three general types with respect to their acyl substituents. They are simple or monoacid if they contain only one type of fatty acid, diacid if they contain two types of fatty acids and triacid if three different acyl groups. Chain lengths of the fatty acids in naturally occurring triglycerides can be of varying lengths and saturations but 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. TG(16:0/16:0/18:0), in particular, consists of one chain of palmitic acid at the C-1 position, one chain of palmitic acid at the C-2 position and one chain of stearic acid at the C-3 position. TGs are the main constituent of vegetable oil and animal fats. TGs are major components of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and chylomicrons, play an important role in metabolism as energy sources and transporters of dietary fat. They contain more than twice the energy (9 kcal/g) of carbohydrates and proteins. In the intestine, triglycerides are split into glycerol and fatty acids (this process is called lipolysis) with the help of lipases and bile secretions, which can then move into blood vessels. The triglycerides are rebuilt in the blood from their fragments and become constituents of lipoproteins, which deliver the fatty acids to and from fat cells among other functions. Various tissues can release the free fatty acids and take them up as a source of energy. Fat cells can synthesize and store triglycerides. When the body requires fatty acids as an energy source, the hormone glucagon signals the breakdown of the triglycerides by hormone-sensitive lipase to release free fatty acids. As the brain cannot utilize fatty acids as an energy source, the glycerol component of triglycerides can be converted into glucose for brain fuel when it is broken down. (www.cyberlipid.org, www.wikipedia.org)TAGs can serve as fatty acid stores in all cells, but primarily in adipocytes of adipose tissue. The major building block for the synthesis of triacylglycerides, in non-adipose tissue, is glycerol. Adipocytes lack glycerol kinase and so must use another route to TAG synthesis. Specifically, dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), which is produced during glycolysis, is the precursor for TAG synthesis in adipose tissue. DHAP can also serve as a TAG precursor in non-adipose tissues, but does so to a much lesser extent than glycerol. The use of DHAP for the TAG backbone depends on whether the synthesis of the TAGs occurs in the mitochondria and ER or the ER and the peroxisomes. The ER/mitochondria pathway requires the action of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase to convert DHAP to glycerol-3-phosphate. Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase then esterifies a fatty acid to glycerol-3-phosphate thereby generating lysophosphatidic acid. The ER/peroxisome reaction pathway uses the peroxisomal enzyme DHAP acyltransferase to acylate DHAP to acyl-DHAP which is then reduced by acyl-DHAP reductase. The fatty acids that are incorporated into TAGs are activated to acyl-CoAs through the action of acyl-CoA synthetases. Two molecules of acyl-CoA are esterified to glycerol-3-phosphate to yield 1,2-diacylglycerol phosphate (also known as phosphatidic acid). The phosphate is then removed by phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP1), to generate 1,2-diacylglycerol. This diacylglycerol serves as the substrate for addition of the third fatty acid to make TAG. Intestinal monoacylglycerols, derived from dietary fats, can also serve as substrates for the synthesis of 1,2-diacylglycerols.",TG(16:0/16:0/18:0),HMDB0005357,,,C00422,Triacylglycerols,FDB023637,,[H]C([H])(OC([*])=O)C([H])(OC([*])=O)C([H])([H])OC([*])=O,Triacylglycerol***Triglyceride***TG(16:0/16:0/18:0)***Tracylglycerol(16:0/16:0/18:0)***TG(50:0)***Tracylglycerol(50:0)***TAG(50:0)***TAG(16:0/16:0/18:0)***1-hexadecanoyl-2-hexadecanoyl-3-octadecanoyl-glycerol***1-palmitoyl-2-palmitoyl-3-stearoyl-glycerol,DQKMNCLZNGAXNX-DPDRHGIRSA-N,

It interferes with nucleic acid synthesis by inhibiting purine metabolism and is used, usually in combination with other drugs, in the treatment of or in remission maintenance programs for leukemia. [PubChem]Mercaptopurine competes with hypoxanthine and guanine for the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRTase) and is itself converted to thioinosinic acid (TIMP). This intracellular nucleotide inhibits several reactions involving inosinic acid (IMP), including the conversion of IMP to xanthylic acid (XMP) and the conversion of IMP to adenylic acid (AMP) via adenylosuccinate (SAMP). In addition, 6-methylthioinosinate (MTIMP) is formed by the methylation of TIMP. Both TIMP and MTIMP have been reported to inhibit glutamine-5-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase, the first enzyme unique to the de novo pathway for purine ribonucleotide synthesis. Experiments indicate that radiolabeled mercaptopurine may be recovered from the DNA in the form of deoxythioguanosine. Some mercaptopurine is converted to nucleotide derivatives of 6-thioguanine (6-TG) by the sequential actions of inosinate (IMP) dehydrogenase and xanthylate (XMP) aminase, converting TIMP to thioguanylic acid (TGMP).",Mercaptopurine,HMDB0015167,,,D04931,,,,[H]SC1=NC([H])=NC2=C1N([H])C([H])=N2,"1,7-dihydro-6H-Purine-6-thione***3H-Purine-6-thiol***6-MP***6-Thiohypoxanthine***6 MP***6-Mercaptopurine***Mercaptopurine monohydrate***Mercapurin***MP***6 Mercaptopurine monohydrate***6-Mercaptopurine monohydrate***Puri-nethol***6 Mercaptopurine***GlaxoSmithKline brand OF 6 mercaptopurine***Leupurin***Wellcome brand OF 6-mercaptopurine***6 Thiohypoxanthine***6 Thiopurine***glaxo Wellcome brand OF 6 mercaptopurine***GlaxoSmithKline brand OF 6-mercaptopurine***Puri nethol***Wellcome brand OF 6 mercaptopurine***6-Thiopurine***glaxo Wellcome brand OF 6-mercaptopurine***Mercaptopurina wellcome***Purimethol***Purinethol",GLVAUDGFNGKCSF-UHFFFAOYSA-N,"InChI=1S/C5H4N4S/c10-5-3-4(7-1-6-3)8-2-9-5/h1-2H,(H2,6,7,8,9,10)"

M03044,79-01-6,16602,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Trichloroethylene is a solvent and extractive in the manufacture of foods. One recent review of the epidemiology of kidney cancer rated cigarette smoking and obesity as more important risk factors for kidney cancer than exposure to solvents such as trichloroethylene. In contrast, the most recent overall assessment of human health risks associated with trichloroethylene states, ""[t]here is concordance between animal and human studies, which supports the conclusion that trichloroethylene is a potential kidney carcinogen"". The evidence appears to be less certain at this time regarding the relationship between humans and liver cancer observed in mice, with the NAS suggesting that low-level exposure might not represent a significant liver cancer risk in the general population. The chemical compound trichloroethylene is a chlorinated hydrocarbon commonly used as an industrial solvent. It is a clear non-flammable liquid with a sweet smell. The first known report of TCE in groundwater was given in 1949 by two English public chemists who described two separate instances of well contamination by industrial releases of TCE. Based on available federal and state surveys, between 9% to 34% of the drinking water supply sources tested in the U.S. may have some TCE contamination, though EPA has reported that most water supplies are in compliance with the Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) of 5 ppb. In addition, a growing concern in recent years at sites with TCE contamination in soil or groundwater has been vapor intrusion in buildings, which has resulted in indoor air exposures, such is in a recent case in the McCook Field Neighborhood of Dayton, Ohio. Trichloroethylene has been detected in 852 Superfund sites across the United States, according to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR). Under the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974, and as amended annual water quality testing is required for all public drinking water distributors. The EPA'S current guidelines for TCE can be found here. It should be noted that the EPA's table of ""TCE Releases to Ground"" is dated 1987 to 1993, thereby omitting one of the largest Superfund Cleanup sites in the nation, the NIBW in Scottsdale, Arizona. The TCE ""released"" here occurred prior to its appearance in the municipal drinking wells in 1982. This reaction can be catalyzed by a variety of substances. The most commonly used catalyst is a mixture of potassium chloride and aluminum chloride. However, various forms of porous carbon can also be used.

Trimethylamine has a boiling point of 2.9 degree centigrade and is a gas at room temperature. Trimethylamine usually comes in pressurized gas cylinders or as a 40% solution in water. Trimethylamine is a nitrogenous base and its positively charged cation is called trimethylammonium cation. A common salt of trimethylamine is trimethylammonium chloride, a hygroscopic colorless solid (Wikipedia). Trimethylamine is a product of decomposition of plants and animals. It is the substance mainly responsible for the fishy odor often associated with fouling fish, bacterial vagina infections, and bad breath. It is also associated with taking large doses of choline (Wikipedia). Trimethylaminuria is a genetic disorder in which the body is unable to metabolize trimethylamine from food sources. Patients develop a characteristic fish odour of their sweat, urine, and breath after the consumption of choline-rich foods. Trimethylaminuria is an autosomal recessive disorder involving a trimethylamine oxidase deficiency. Trimethylaminuria has also been observed in a certain breed of Rhode Island Red chicken that produces eggs with a fishy smell (Wikipedia).

M03054,1184-78-7,15724,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is an oxidation product of trimethylamine and a common metabolite in animals and humans. In particular, trimethylamine-N-oxide is biosynthesized endogenously from trimethylamine, which is derived from choline, which can be derived from dietary lecithin (phosphatidylcholines) or dietary carnitine. TMAO decomposes to trimethylamine (TMA), which is the main odorant that is characteristic of degrading seafood. TMAO is an osmolyte that the body will use to counteract the effects of increased concentrations of urea (due to kidney failure) and high levels can be used as a biomarker for kidney problems. Fish odor syndrome or trimethylaminuria is a defect in the production of the enzyme flavin containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3) causing incomplete breakdown of trimethylamine from choline-containing food into trimethylamine oxide. Trimethylamine then builds up and is released in the person's sweat, urine, and breath, giving off a strong fishy odor. The concentration of TMAO in the blood increases after consuming foods containing carnitine or lecithin (phosphatidylcholines), if the bacteria that convert those substances to TMAO are present in the gut (PMID: 23614584). High concentrations of carnitine are found in red meat, some energy drinks, and certain dietary supplements; lecithin is found in eggs and is commonly used as an ingredient in processed food. High levels of TMAO are found in many seafoods.  Some types of normal gut bacteria (e.g. species of Acinetobacter) in the human gut convert dietary carnitine and dietary lecithin to TMAO (PMID: 21475195). TMAO alters cholesterol metabolism in the intestines, in the liver and in arterial wall. When TMAO is present, cholesterol metabolism is altered and there is an increased deposition of cholesterol within, and decreased removal of cholesterol from, peripheral cells such as those in the artery wall (PMID: 23563705). Urinary TMAO is a biomarker for the consumption of fish, especially cold-water fish.

M03116,,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Undecanoyl CoA is an acyl-CoA with the C-11 Acyl chain. Acyl-CoA (or formyl-CoA) is a coenzyme involved in the metabolism of fatty acids. It is a temporary compound formed when coenzyme A (CoA) attaches to the end of a long-chain fatty acid, inside living cells. The CoA is then removed from the chain, carrying two carbons from the chain with it, forming acetyl-CoA. This is then used in the citric acid cycle to start a chain of reactions, eventually forming many adenosine triphosphates. To be oxidatively degraded, a fatty acid must first be activated in a two-step reaction catalyzed by acyl-CoA synthetase. First, the fatty acid displaces the diphosphate group of ATP, then coenzyme A (HSCoA) displaces the AMP group to form an Acyl-CoA. The acyladenylate product of the first step has a large free energy of hydrolysis and conserves the free energy of the cleaved phosphoanhydride bond in ATP. The second step, transfer of the acyl group to CoA (the same molecule that carries acetyl groups as acetyl-CoA), conserves free energy in the formation of a thioester bond. Consequently, the overall reaction Fatty acid + CoA + ATP <=> Acyl-CoA + AMP + PPi has a free energy change near zero. Subsequent hydrolysis of the product PPi (by the enzyme inorganic pyrophosphatase) is highly exergonic, and this reaction makes the formation of acyl-CoA spontaneous and irreversible. Fatty acids are activated in the cytosol, but oxidation occurs in the mitochondria. Because there is no transport protein for CoA adducts, acyl groups must enter the mitochondria via a shuttle system involving the small molecule carnitine.",Undecanoyl-CoA,HMDB0013114,,,,,FDB029290,M03116,[H]OC([H])(C(=O)N([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C(=O)N([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])SC(=O)C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])[H])C(C([H])([H])[H])(C([H])([H])[H])C([H])([H])OP(=O)(O[H])OP(=O)(O[H])OC([H])([H])[C@@]1([H])O[C@@]([H])(N2C([H])=NC3=C2N=C([H])N=C3N([H])[H])[C@]([H])(O[H])[C@]1([H])OP(=O)(O[H])O[H],"2-Methyloctanoyl CoA, 21***2-Methyloctanoyl coenzyme A, 21",IZWCGXGZGYKDHR-WMMBNDHFSA-N,"InChI=1S/C32H56N7O17P3S/c1-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-11-12-23(41)60-16-15-34-22(40)13-14-35-30(44)27(43)32(2,3)18-53-59(50,51)56-58(48,49)52-17-21-26(55-57(45,46)47)25(42)31(54-21)39-20-38-24-28(33)36-19-37-29(24)39/h19-21,25-27,31,42-43H,4-18H2,1-3H3,(H,34,40)(H,35,44)(H,48,49)(H,50,51)(H2,33,36,37)(H2,45,46,47)/t21-,25-,26-,27?,31-/m1/s1"

M03161,9005-79-2,28087,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Glycogen is a highly-branched polymer of about 30,000 glucose residues and has a molecular weight between 106 and 107 daltons (4.8 million approx.). Most of Glc units are linked by alpha-1,4 glycosidic bonds, approximately 1 in 12 Glc residues also makes -1,6 glycosidic bond with a second Glc which results in the creation of a branch. Glycogen only has one reducing end and a large number of non-reducing ends with a free hydroxyl group at carbon 4. The glycogen granules contain both glycogen and the enzymes of glycogen synthesis (glycogenesis) and degradation (glycogenolysis). The enzymes are nested between the outer branches of the glycogen molecules and act on the non-reducing ends. Therefore, the many non-reducing end-branches of glycogen facilitate its rapid synthesis and breakdown. In hypoglycemia caused by excessive insulin, liver glycogen levels are high, but the high insulin level prevents the glycogenolysis necessary to maintain normal blood sugar levels. Glucagon is a common treatment for this type of hypoglycemia. Glycogen is a polysaccharide that is the principal storage form of glucose (Glc) in animal and human cells. Glycogen is found in the form of granules in the cytosol in many cell types. Hepatocytes (liver cells) have the highest concentration of it - up to 8% of the fresh weight in well fed state, or 100 to 120 g in an adult - giving liver a distinctive, 'starchy taste'.

M03168,6244-93-5,,Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Malonyl-CoA semialdehyde is involved in the propanoate metabolism pathway. Malonyl-CoA semialdehyde can be reversibly produced from malonyl-CoA and 3-hydroxy-propionyl-CoA. Malonic semialdehyde is formed in the alternative pathway of propionate metabolism and in the catabolism of beta-alanine. Studies of these pathways in cultured cells from a patient with mitochondrial malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency indicate that malonic semialdehyde is directly converted into acetyl-CoA in man.

mal_L,97-67-6,30797,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Malic acid is a tart-tasting organic dicarboxylic acid that plays a role in many sour or tart foods. Apples contain malic acid, which contributes to the sourness of a green apple. Malic acid can make a wine taste tart, although the amount decreases with increasing fruit ripeness. (wikipedia). In its ionized form malic acid is called malate. Malate is an intermediate of the TCA cycle along with fumarate. It can also be formed from pyruvate as one of the anaplerotic reactions. In humans, malic acid is both derived from food sources and synthesized in the body through the citric acid cycle or Krebs cycle which takes place in the mitochondria. Malate's importance to the production of energy in the body during both aerobic and anaerobic conditions is well established. Under aerobic conditions, the oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate provides reducing equivalents to the mitochondria through the malate-aspartate redox shuttle. During anaerobic conditions, where a buildup of excess of reducing equivalents inhibits glycolysis, malic acid's simultaneous reduction to succinate and oxidation to oxaloacetate is capable of removing the accumulating reducing equivalents. This allows malic acid to reverse hypoxia's inhibition of glycolysis and energy production. In studies on rats it has been found that only tissue malate is depleted following exhaustive physical activity. Other key metabolites from the citric acid cycle needed for energy production were found to be unchanged. Because of this, a deficiency of malic acid has been hypothesized to be a major cause of physical exhaustion. Notably, the administration of malic acid to rats has been shown to elevate mitochondrial malate and increase mitochondrial respiration and energy production.",L-Malic acid,HMDB0000156,,,C00149,,FDB001044,mal_L,[H]O[C@]([H])(C([O-])=O)C([H])([H])C([O-])=O,(-)-L-Malic acid***(S)-(-)-Hydroxysuccinic acid***L-2-Hydroxybutanedioic acid***L-Apple acid***Malate***Malic acid***S-2-Hydroxybutanedioic acid***(-)-L-Malate***L-Malate***(S)-(-)-Hydroxysuccinate***L-2-Hydroxybutanedioate***S-2-Hydroxybutanedioate***(-)-(S)-Malate***(-)-(S)-Malic acid***(-)-Hydroxysuccinate***(-)-Hydroxysuccinic acid***(-)-Malic acid***(2S)-2-Hydroxybutanedioate***(2S)-2-Hydroxybutanedioic acid***(S)-Hydroxy-butanedioate***(S)-Hydroxy-butanedioic acid***(S)-Hydroxybutanedioate***(S)-Hydroxybutanedioic acid***(S)-Malic acid***Apple acid***L-(-)-Malic acid***L-Hydroxybutanedioate***L-Hydroxybutanedioic acid***L-Hydroxysuccinate***L-Hydroxysuccinic acid***S-(-)-Malate***S-(-)-Malic acid,BJEPYKJPYRNKOW-REOHCLBHSA-L,"InChI=1S/C4H6O5/c5-2(4(8)9)1-3(6)7/h2,5H,1H2,(H,6,7)(H,8,9)/p-2/t2-/m0/s1"

man,3458-28-4,4208,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): D-Mannose is a carbohydrate. High-mannose-type oligosaccharides have been shown to play important roles in protein quality control. Several intracellular proteins, such as lectins, chaperones and glycan-processing enzymes, are involved in this process. These include calnexin/calreticulin, UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGGT), cargo receptors (such as VIP36 and ERGIC-53), mannosidase-like proteins (e.g. EDEM and Htm1p) and ubiquitin ligase (Fbs). They are thought to recognize high-mannose-type glycans with subtly different structures. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is an important constituent of the innate immune system. This protein binds through multiple lectin domains to the repeating sugar arrays that decorate many microbial surfaces, and is then able to activate the complement system through a specific protease called MBL-associated protease-2. The primary pathway for the formation of L-fucose in procaryotic and eucaryotic cells is from D-mannose via an internal oxidation reduction and then epimerization of GDP-D-mannose to produce GDP-L-fucose.

melanin,8049-97-6,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Dermal melanin is produced by melanocytes, which are found in the stratum basale of the epidermis. Although human beings generally possess a similar concentration of melanocytes in their skin, the melanocytes in some individuals and races more frequently or less frequently express the melanin-producing genes, thereby conferring a greater or lesser concentration of skin melanin. Some individual animals and humans have no or very little melanin in their bodies, which is a condition known as albinism. Higher eumelanin levels also can be a disadvantage, however, beyond a higher disposition toward vitamin D deficiency. Dark skin is a complicating factor in the laser removal of port-wine stains. Effective in treating fair skin, lasers generally are less successful in removing port-wine stains in Asians and people of African descent. Higher concentrations of melanin in darker-skinned individuals simply diffuse and absorb the laser radiation, inhibiting light absorption by the targeted tissue. Melanin similarly can complicate laser treatment of other dermatological conditions in people with darker skin. Under the microscope melanin is brown, non-refractile and finely granular with individual granules having a diameter of less than 800 nanometers. This differentiates melanin from common blood breakdown pigments which are larger, chunky and refractile and range in color from green to yellow or red-brown. In heavily pigmented lesions, dense aggregates of melanin can obscure histologic detail. A dilute solution of potassium permanganate is an effective melanin bleach. Pigments causing darkness in skin, hair, feathers, etc. They are irregular polymeric structures and are divided into three groups: allomelanins in the plant kingdom and eumelanins and phaeomelanins in the animal kingdom. Because melanin is an aggregate of smaller component molecules, there are a number of different types of melanin with differing proportions and bonding patterns of these component molecules. Both pheomelanin and eumelanin are found in human skin and hair, but eumelanin is the most abundant melanin in humans, as well as the form most likely to be deficient in albinism. Freckles and moles are formed where there is a localized concentration of melanin in the skin. They are highly associated with pale skin. Melanin is a biopolymer and a neuropeptide. In the early 1970s, John McGinness, Peter Corry, and Peter Proctor reported that melanin is a high-conductivity organic semiconductor (Science, vol 183, 853-855 (1974)). Studies revealed that melanin acted as a voltage-controlled solid-state threshold switch.

melatn,73-31-4,16796,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Melatonin is a biogenic amine that is found in animals, plants and microbes. Aaron B.Lerner of Yale University is credited for naming the hormone and for defining its chemical structure in 1958. In mammals, melatonin is produced by the pineal gland. The pineal gland is small endocrine gland, about the size of a rice grain and shaped like a pine cone (hence the name), that is located in the center of the brain (rostro-dorsal to the superior colliculus) but outside the blood-brain barrier. The secretion of melatonin increases in darkness and decreases during exposure to light, thereby regulating the circadian rhythms of several biological functions, including the sleep-wake cycle. In particular, melatonin regulates the sleep-wake cycle by chemically causing drowsiness and. lowering the body temperature. Melatonin is also implicated in the regulation of mood,learning and memory, immune activity, dreaming, fertility and reproduction. Melatonin is also an effective antioxidant. Most of the actions of melatonin are mediated through the binding and activation of melatonin receptors. Individuals with autism spectrum disorders(ASD) may have lower than normal levels of melatonin. A 2008 study found that unaffected parents of individuals with ASD also have lower melatonin levels, and that the deficits. were associated with low activity of the ASMT gene, which encodes the last enzyme of melatonin synthesis.

melib,,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): TG(18:4(6Z,9Z,12Z,15Z)/18:1(9Z)/20:5(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)) is a monoeicosapentaenoic acid triglyceride. Triglycerides (TGs or TAGs) are also known as triacylglycerols or triacylglycerides, meaning that they are glycerides in which the glycerol is esterified with three fatty acid groups (i.e. fatty acid trimesters of glycerol). TGs may be divided into three general types with respect to their acyl substituents. They are simple or monoacid if they contain only one type of fatty acid, diacid if they contain two types of fatty acids and triacid if three different acyl groups. Chain lengths of the fatty acids in naturally occurring triglycerides can be of varying lengths and saturations but 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. TG(18:4(6Z,9Z,12Z,15Z)/18:1(9Z)/20:5(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)), in particular, consists of one chain of stearidonic acid at the C-1 position, one chain of oleic acid at the C-2 position and one chain of eicosapentaenoic acid at the C-3 position. TGs are the main constituent of vegetable oil and animal fats. TGs are major components of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and chylomicrons, play an important role in metabolism as energy sources and transporters of dietary fat. They contain more than twice the energy (9 kcal/g) of carbohydrates and proteins. In the intestine, triglycerides are split into glycerol and fatty acids (this process is called lipolysis) with the help of lipases and bile secretions, which can then move into blood vessels. The triglycerides are rebuilt in the blood from their fragments and become constituents of lipoproteins, which deliver the fatty acids to and from fat cells among other functions. Various tissues can release the free fatty acids and take them up as a source of energy. Fat cells can synthesize and store triglycerides. When the body requires fatty acids as an energy source, the hormone glucagon signals the breakdown of the triglycerides by hormone-sensitive lipase to release free fatty acids. As the brain cannot utilize fatty acids as an energy source, the glycerol component of triglycerides can be converted into glucose for brain fuel when it is broken down. (www.cyberlipid.org, www.wikipedia.org)<br />TAGs can serve as fatty acid stores in all cells, but primarily in adipocytes of adipose tissue. The major building block for the synthesis of triacylglycerides, in non-adipose tissue, is glycerol. Adipocytes lack glycerol kinase and so must use another route to TAG synthesis. Specifically, dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), which is produced during glycolysis, is the precursor for TAG synthesis in adipose tissue. DHAP can also serve as a TAG precursor in non-adipose tissues, but does so to a much lesser extent than glycerol. The use of DHAP for the TAG backbone depends on whether the synthesis of the TAGs occurs in the mitochondria and ER or the ER and the peroxisomes. The ER/mitochondria pathway requires the action of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase to convert DHAP to glycerol-3-phosphate. Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase then esterifies a fatty acid to glycerol-3-phosphate thereby generating lysophosphatidic acid. The ER/peroxisome reaction pathway uses the peroxisomal enzyme DHAP acyltransferase to acylate DHAP to acyl-DHAP which is then reduced by acyl-DHAP reductase. The fatty acids that are incorporated into TAGs are activated to acyl-CoAs through the action of acyl-CoA synthetases. Two molecules of acyl-CoA are esterified to glycerol-3-phosphate to yield 1,2-diacylglycerol phosphate (also known as phosphatidic acid). The phosphate is then removed by phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP1), to generate 1,2-diacylglycerol. This diacylglycerol serves as the substrate for addition of the third fatty acid to make TAG. Intestinal monoacylglycerols, derived from dietary fats, can also serve as substrates for the synthesis of 1,2-diacylglycerols.","TG(18:4(6Z,9Z,12Z,15Z)/18:1(9Z)/20:5(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z))",HMDB0055419,,,,,,,,"1-(6Z,9Z,12Z,15Z-Octadecatetraenoyl)-2-(9Z-octadecenoyl)-3-(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z-eicosapentaenoyl)-glycerol***1-Stearidonoyl-2-oleoyl-3-eicosapentaenoyl-glycerol***TAG(18:4/18:1/20:5)***TAG(56:10)***TG(18:4/18:1/20:5)***TG(56:10)***Tracylglycerol(18:4/18:1/20:5)***Tracylglycerol(56:10)***Triacylglycerol***Triglyceride***TG(18:4(6Z,9Z,12Z,15Z)/18:1(9Z)/20:5(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z))",KDEWWQZHBSXNPX-XGZCLZEASA-N,

met_L,63-68-3,16643,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Methionine is an essential amino acid (there are 9 essential amino acids) required for normal growth and development of humans, other mammals, and avian species. In addition to being a substrate for protein synthesis, it is an intermediate in transmethylation reactions, serving as the major methyl group donor in vivo, including the methyl groups for DNA and RNA intermediates. Methionine is a methyl acceptor for 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase (methionine synthase), the only reaction that allows for the recycling of this form of folate, and is also a methyl acceptor for the catabolism of betaine. Methionine is the metabolic precursor for cysteine. Only the sulfur atom from methionine is transferred to cysteine; the carbon skeleton of cysteine is donated by serine (PMID: 16702340). There is a general consensus concerning normal sulfur amino acid (SAA) requirements. WHO recommendations amount to 13 mg/kg per 24 h in healthy adults. This amount is roughly doubled in artificial nutrition regimens. In disease or after trauma, requirements may be altered for methionine, cysteine, and taurine. Although in specific cases of congenital enzyme deficiency, prematurity, or diminished liver function, hypermethioninemia or hyperhomocysteinemia may occur, SAA supplementation can be considered safe in amounts exceeding 2-3 times the minimum recommended daily intake. Apart from some very specific indications (e.g. acetaminophen poisoning) the usefulness of SAA supplementation is not yet established (PMID: 16702341). Methionine is known to exacerbate psychopathological symptoms in schizophrenic patients, but there is no evidence of similar effects in healthy subjects. The role of methionine as a precursor of homocysteine is the most notable cause for concern. Acute doses of methionine can lead to acute increases in plasma homocysteine, which can be used as an index of the susceptibility to cardiovascular disease. Sufficiently high doses of methionine can actually result in death. Longer-term studies in adults have indicated no adverse consequences of moderate fluctuations in dietary methionine intake, but intakes higher than 5 times the normal amount resulted in elevated homocysteine levels. These effects of methionine on homocysteine and vascular function are moderated by supplements of vitamins B-6, B-12, C, and folic acid (PMID: 16702346). When present in sufficiently high levels, methionine can act as an atherogen and a metabotoxin. An atherogen is a compound that when present at chronically high levels causes atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of methionine are associated with at least ten inborn errors of metabolism, including cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency, glycine N-methyltransferase deficiency, homocystinuria, tyrosinemia, galactosemia, homocystinuria-megaloblastic anemia due to defects in cobalamin metabolism, methionine adenosyltransferase deficiency, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency, and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) hydrolase deficiency. Chronically elevated levels of methionine in infants can lead to intellectual disability and other neurological problems, delays in motor skills, sluggishness, muscle weakness, and liver problems. Many individuals with these metabolic disorders tend to develop cardiovascular disease later in life. Studies on feeding rodents high levels of methionine have shown that methionine promotes atherosclerotic plaques independently of homocysteine levels (PMID: 26647293). A similar study in Finnish men showed the same effect (PMID: 16487911).",L-Methionine,HMDB0000696,,,C00073,MET,FDB012683,met_L,[H]C([H])([H])SC([H])([H])C([H])([H])[C@@]([H])(C([O-])=O)[N+]([H])([H])[H],"(2S)-2-amino-4-(Methylsulfanyl)butanoic acid***(S)-2-amino-4-(methylthio)Butanoic acid***(S)-2-amino-4-(methylthio)Butyric acid***(S)-Methionine***L-(-)-Methionine***L-alpha-amino-gamma-Methylmercaptobutyric acid***L-Methionin***M***Met***METHIONINE***(2S)-2-amino-4-(Methylsulfanyl)butanoate***(2S)-2-amino-4-(Methylsulphanyl)butanoate***(2S)-2-amino-4-(Methylsulphanyl)butanoic acid***(S)-2-amino-4-(methylthio)Butanoate***(S)-2-amino-4-(methylthio)Butyrate***L-a-amino-g-Methylmercaptobutyrate***L-a-amino-g-Methylmercaptobutyric acid***L-alpha-amino-gamma-Methylmercaptobutyrate***L-α-amino-γ-methylmercaptobutyrate***L-α-amino-γ-methylmercaptobutyric acid***(L)-Methionine***(S)-(+)-Methionine***(S)-2-amino-4-(methylthio)-Butanoate***(S)-2-amino-4-(methylthio)-Butanoic acid***2-amino-4-(methylthio)Butyrate***2-amino-4-(methylthio)Butyric acid***2-amino-4-Methylthiobutanoate***2-amino-4-Methylthiobutanoic acid***a-amino-g-Methylmercaptobutyrate***a-amino-g-Methylmercaptobutyric acid***Acimethin***alpha-amino-alpha-Aminobutyric acid***alpha-amino-gamma-Methylmercaptobutyrate***alpha-amino-gamma-Methylmercaptobutyric acid***Cymethion***g-methylthio-a-Aminobutyrate***g-methylthio-a-Aminobutyric acid***gamma-methylthio-alpha-Aminobutyrate***gamma-methylthio-alpha-Aminobutyric acid***H-Met-H***H-Met-OH***L(-)-amino-alpha-amino-alpha-Aminobutyric acid***L(-)-amino-gamma-Methylthiobutyric acid***L-2-amino-4-(methylthio)Butyric acid***L-2-amino-4-Methylthiobutyric acid***L-a-amino-g-Methylthiobutyrate***L-a-amino-g-Methylthiobutyric acid***L-alpha-amino-gamma-Methylthiobutyrate***L-alpha-amino-gamma-Methylthiobutyric acid***L-gamma-methylthio-alpha-Aminobutyric acid***L-Methioninum***Liquimeth***Mepron***Methilanin***Methioninum***Metionina***neo-Methidin***Poly-L-methionine***Polymethionine***S-Methionine***S-Methyl-L-homocysteine***Toxin war***L-Isomer methionine***Methionine, L-isomer***Pedameth***Methionine, L isomer",FFEARJCKVFRZRR-BYPYZUCNSA-N,"InChI=1S/C5H11NO2S/c1-9-3-2-4(6)5(7)8/h4H,2-3,6H2,1H3,(H,7,8)/t4-/m0/s1"

methf,7444-29-3,15636,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Folate is important for cells and tissues that rapidly divide. Cancer cells divide rapidly, and drugs that interfere with folate metabolism are used to treat cancer. Methotrexate is a drug often used to treat cancer because it inhibits the production of the active form, tetrahydrofolate. Unfortunately, methotrexate can be toxic, producing side effects such as inflammation in the digestive tract that make it difficult to eat normally. Folinic acid is a form of folate that can help 'rescue' or reverse the toxic effects of methotrexate. Folinic acid is not the same as folic acid. Folic acid supplements have little established role in cancer chemotherapy. There have been cases of severe adverse effects of accidental substitution of folic acid for folinic acid in patients receiving methotrexate cancer chemotherapy. It is important for anyone receiving methotrexate to follow medical advice on the use of folic or folinic acid supplements. Low concentrations of folate, vitamin B12, or vitamin B6 may increase your level of homocysteine, an amino acid normally found in your blood. There is evidence that an elevated homocysteine level is an independent risk factor for heart disease and stroke. The evidence suggests that high levels of homocysteine may damage coronary arteries or make it easier for blood clotting cells called platelets to clump together and form a clot. However, there is currently no evidence available to suggest that lowering homocysteine with vitamins will reduce your risk of heart disease. Clinical intervention trials are needed to determine whether supplementation with folic acid, vitamin B12 or vitamin B6 can lower your risk of developing coronary heart disease. Methylene tetrahydrofolate (CH2FH4) is formed from tetrahydrofolate by the addition of methylene groups from one of three carbon donors: formaldehyde, serine, or glycine. Methyl tetrahydrofolate(CH3FH4) can be made from methylene tetrahydrofolate by reduction of the methylene group, and formyl tetrahydrofolate (CHOFH4, folinic acid) is made by oxidation of methylene tetrahydrofolate. In the form of a series of tetrahydrofolate compounds, folate derivatives are substrates in a number of single-carbon-transfer reactions, and also are involved in the synthesis of dTMP (2'-deoxythymidine-5'-phosphate) from dUMP (2'-deoxyuridine-5'-phosphate). It helps convert vitamin B12 to one of its coenzyme forms and helps synthesize the DNA required for all rapidly growing cells.","5,10-Methenyltetrahydrofolic acid",HMDB0001354,,,C00445,"5,10-methenyl-thf",FDB022573,methf,[H]OC1=NC(=NC2=C1[N+]1=C([H])N(C3=C([H])C([H])=C(C([H])=C3[H])C(=O)N([H])[C@]([H])(C([O-])=O)C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([O-])=O)C([H])([H])[C@@]1([H])C([H])([H])N2[H])N([H])[H],"5,10-Methenyl-THF***5,10-Methenyltetrahydrofolate***anhydro-Leucovorin***anhydro-Leucovorin a***Anhydroleucovorin***Anhydroleucovorin a***CH-THF***Methenyl-tetrahydrofolate***Methenyl-THF***Methenyltetrahydrofolate***Methenyltetrahydrofolic acid***N5-N10-CH-THF***N5-N10-Methenyltetrahydrofolate***5,10-Methenyltetrahydropteroylglutamate***N5,N10-Methenyl tetrahydrofolate",MEANFMOQMXYMCT-QWHCGFSZSA-M,"InChI=1S/C20H21N7O6/c21-20-24-16-15(18(31)25-20)27-9-26(8-12(27)7-22-16)11-3-1-10(2-4-11)17(30)23-13(19(32)33)5-6-14(28)29/h1-4,9,12-13H,5-8H2,(H6-,21,22,23,24,25,28,29,30,31,32,33)/p-1/t12-,13+/m0/s1"

mg2,7439-95-4,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Magnesium salts are essential in nutrition, being required for the activity of many enzymes, especially those concerned with oxidative phosphorylation. Physiologically, it exists as an ion in the body. It is a component of both intra- and extracellular fluids and is excreted in the urine and feces. Deficiency causes irritability of the nervous system with tetany, vasodilatation, convulsions, tremors, depression, and psychotic behavior. Magnesium ion in large amounts is an ionic laxative, and magnesium sulfate (Epsom salts) is sometimes used for this purpose. So-called ""milk of magnesia"" is a water suspension of one of the few insoluble magnesium compounds, magnesium hydroxide; the undissolved particles give rise to its appearance and name. Milk of magnesia is a mild base, and is commonly used as an antacid. Moreover, magnesium is found to be associated with primary hypomagnesemia, which is an inborn error of metabolism.",Magnesium,HMDB0000547,,,,,,,,,JLVVSXFLKOJNIY-UHFFFAOYSA-N,InChI=1S/Mg/q+2

mi1345p,102850-29-3,16783,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphopsphate (IP4) is a second messenger responsible for mediating Ca2+ entry through plasma membrane and mobilize intracellular Ca2+ by acting synergistically with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase (IP3K, EC 2.7.1.127) phosphorylates IP3 to IP4. Evidence shows that IP4 can activate a protein with ras- and rap-GAP activity and finally inactivate the G protein. This indicates that IP4 regulates Ca2+ influx in a GTP-dependent way, which potentially links the IP3 signaling pathway to GTP-regulated signaling mechanisms. IP4 is demonstrated to be a common regulator in Ca2+ homeostasis. IP4 can bind with high affinity to several intracellular proteins: synaptotagmin (I and II), Gap1, Btk, and centaurin-alpha-and may interact with synaptotagmin to inhibit synaptic transmission. IP4 also acts as a mediator in neuronal death in the ischemic hippocampus. IP4 production is not always associated with modification in calcium concentration, and control of calcium mobilization is not the sole function proposed for IP4. IP4 define an essential signaling pathway for T cell precursor responsiveness and development. In the thymus, IP4 is essential during positive and negative selection of double-positive thymocytes, and in the control of thymocyte reactivity to antigens. 1D-Myo-inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate is also a substrate for Type I inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate 5-phosphatase, Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 5-phosphatase A and Skeletal muscle and kidney enriched inositol phosphatase.

Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate is released into the cytoplasm where it releases calcium ions from internal stores within the cell's endoplasmic reticulum. These calcium ions stimulate the activity of B kinase or calmodulin. (PubChem). Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) is traditionally considered to be the messenger that initiates the increase and spreading of the activating Ca2+ wave. In line with this hypothesis, recent evidence suggests that the penetrating sperm delivers into mammalian eggs a novel isoform of phospholipase C (PLC), which promotes the formation of InsP3. The mechanism by which the interacting sperm triggers the production of NAADP and subsequently that of InsP3 remains obscure.

D-Myo-inositol (3,4,5,6) tetrakisphosphate (Ins(3,4,5,6)P4) has a direct biphasic (activation/inhibition) effect on an epithelial Ca2+-activated chloride channel. The effect of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 is not mimicked by other inositol tetrakisphosphate isomers, is dependent on the prevailing calcium concentration, and is influenced when channels are phosphorylated by calmodulin kinase II. The predominant effect of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 on phosphorylated channels is inhibitory at levels of intracellular calcium observed in stimulated cells. Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 activity acts to inhibit calcium-dependent chloride secretion. The secretion of fluid and electrolytes across intestinal epithelial cells in response to Ca2+-dependent secretagogues is a tightly regulated process that is subject to both positive and negative influences. Agonists of Gq protein-coupled receptor (GqPCRs) appear to have the ability to evoke antisecretory mechanisms.

Interestingly, methylamine and ammonia levels are reciprocally controlled by a semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase activity that deaminates methylamine to formaldehyde with the production of ammonia and hydrogen peroxide. Methylamine also targets the voltage-operated neuronal potassium channels, probably inducing release of neurotransmitter(s). Semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO) catalyzes the deamination of primary amines. Such deamination has been shown capable of regulating glucose transport in adipose cells. It has been independently discovered that the primary structure of vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1) is identical to SSAO. Increased serum SSAO activities have been found in patients with diabetic mellitus, vascular disorders and Alzheimer's disease. The SSAO-catalyzed deamination of endogenous substrates like methylamine led to production of toxic formaldehyde. Chronic elevated methylamine increases the excretion of malondialdehyde and microalbuminuria. Amine oxidase substrates such as methylamine have been shown to stimulate glucose uptake by increasing the recruitment of the glucose transporter GLUT4 from vesicles within the cell to the cell surface. Inhibition of this effect by the presence of semicarbazide and catalase led to the suggestion that the process is mediated by the H (2) O (2) produced in the oxidation of these amines.

mnl,,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Mannitol is a diuretic and renal diagnostic aid related to sorbitol. It has little significant energy value as it is largely eliminated from the body before any metabolism can take place. It can be used to treat oliguria associated with kidney failure or other manifestations of inadequate renal function and has been used for determination of glomerular filtration rate. Mannitol is also commonly used as a research tool in cell biological studies, usually to control osmolarity. Chemically, mannitol is an alcohol and a sugar, or a polyol; it is similar to xylitol or sorbitol. However, mannitol has a tendency to lose a hydrogen ion in aqueous solutions, which causes the solution to become acidic. For this, it is not uncommon to add a substance to adjust its pH, such as sodium bicarbonate. Mannitol is a non-permeating molecule i.e. it cannot cross biological membranes. Mannitol or hexan-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexol (C6H8(OH)6) is an osmotic diuretic agent and a weak renal vasodilator. It is a sorbitol isomer. Mannitol is found to be associated with cytochrome c oxidase deficiency and ribose-5-phosphate isomerase deficiency, which are inborn errors of metabolism.",D-Mannitol,HMDB0000765,,,,,,,,,,

N1aspmd,14278-49-0,17927,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): N1-Acetylspermidine is a polyamine. In many organisms, polyamines originate from L-ornithine and methionine. Ornithine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.17), a key enzyme in polyamine metabolism, decarboxylates L-ornithine to yield putrescine which is then converted to higher polyamines spermidine and spermine by successive addition of aminopropyl groups derived from decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine. Aliphatic polyamines occur ubiquitously in organisms and have important functions in the stabilization of cell membranes, biosynthesis of informing molecules, cell growth and differentiation, as well as adaptation to osmotic, ionic, pH and thermal stress. These cationic substances are implicated in multiple functions, therefore it is not surprising that intracellular levels of polyamines are regulated by different mechanisms. The inhibition of polyamine metabolism has important pharmacological and therapeutic implications for the control of physiological processes, reproduction, cancer and parasitic diseases. Recent reports have suggested the idea that parasites with an high turnover of Ornithine Decarboxilase (ODC) are resistant to Difluoromethyl ornithine (DFMO, the irreversible inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase) because they always contain a fraction of newly synthesized and active enzyme, therefore not DFMO inhibited, sufficient to produce small amounts of putrescine rapidly converted into spermidine, which can support protozoan proliferation.

n2,,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Elemental nitrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless and mostly inert diatomic gas at standard conditions, constituting 78% by volume of Earth's atmosphere. Nitrogen occurs in all living organisms. It is a constituent element of amino acids and therefore of proteins and nucleic acids (DNA and RNA). Nitrogen is found in the chemical structure of almost all neurotransmitters and is a key component of alkaloids. Specific bacteria (e.g. Rhizobium trifolium) possess nitrogenase enzymes which can fix atmospheric nitrogen into a form (ammonium ion) which is chemically useful to higher organisms. Animals use nitrogen-containing amino acids from plant sources, as starting materials for all nitrogen-compound animal biochemistry, including the manufacture of proteins and nucleic acids. Animal metabolism of NO (nitric oxide) results in production of nitrite. Animal metabolism of nitrogen in proteins generally results in excretion of urea, while animal metabolism of nucleic acids results in excretion of urea and uric acid. The characteristic odor of animal flesh decay is caused by nitrogen-containing long-chain amines, such as putrescine and cadaverine. Decay of organisms and their waste products may produce small amounts of nitrate, but most decay eventually returns nitrogen content to the atmosphere, as molecular nitrogen. The circulation of nitrogen from the atmosphere through organics and then back to the atmosphere is commonly referred to as the nitrogen cycle. Nitrogen can be measured in urine with the Kjeldahl method or by spectrophotometric methods (enzymic tests). Total urinary nitrogen is calculated based on urea urinary nitrogen quantified with these methods.",Nitrogen,HMDB0001371,,,,,,,,,,

It is the second most concentrated molecule in the brain after the amino acid glutamate. It is synthesized in neurons from the amino acid aspartate and acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl CoA). The various functions served by N-acetylaspartic acid are still under investigation, but the primary proposed functions include (1) acting as a neuronal osmolyte that is involved in fluid balance in the brain, (2) serving as a source of acetate for lipid and myelin synthesis in oligodendrocytes (the glial cells that myelinate neuronal axons), (3) serving as a precursor for the synthesis of the important dipeptide neurotransmitter N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG), and (4) playing a potential role in energy production from the amino acid glutamate in neuronal mitochondria. High neurotransmitter levels can lead to abnormal neural signaling, delayed or arrested intellectual development, and difficulties with general motor skills. When present in sufficiently high levels, N-acetylaspartic acid can be a neurotoxin, an acidogen, and a metabotoxin. A neurotoxin is a compound that disrupts or attacks neural tissue. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of N-acetylaspartic acid are associated with Canavan disease. N-acetylaspartic acid is an organic acid. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. Infants with acidosis have symptoms that include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy).

The initial steps of the arginine biosynthetic pathways proceed via N-acetylated intermediates. The presumed reason for this is that the acetylation prevents the spontaneous cyclization of glutamate derivatives, which leads to proline biosynthesis. N-acetyl-L-ornithine can be transcarbamylated directly by the enzyme acetylornithine transcarbamylase, resulting in N-acetyl-L-citrulline. The enzyme acetylornithine deacetylase can accept N-acetyl-L-citrulline as a substrate, and can deacetylate it into citrulline.

Serotonin-N-acetyltransferase (SNAT), which regulates the rate of melatonin biosynthesis in the pineal gland, catalyzes the acetylation of 5HT to N-acetylserotonin (NAS). A methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine is transferred to NAS by hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase (HIOMT), and finally NAS is converted to 5-methoxy-N-acetyltryptamine, or melatonin. In most mammalian species the content of NAS (and melatonin) in the pineal gland shows clear circadian changes with the highest level occurring during the dark period. This elevation of the contents of NAS (and melatonin) in the dark period is due to the increase of SNAT activity and the elevation of SNAT gene expression. Experimental studies show that N-acetylserotonin possess free radical scavenging activity. Acute administration of irreversible and reversible selective MAO-A inhibitors and high doses (or chronic administration of low doses) of relatively selective MAO-B inhibitors (but not of highly selective MAO-B inhibitors) suppressed MAO-A activity and stimulated N-acetylation of pineal serotonin into N-acetylserotonin, the immediate precursor of melatonin. N-acetylserotonin increase after MAO-A inhibitors might mediate their antidepressive and antihypertensive effects.

nh4,7664-41-7,16134,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Ammonia is a colourless alkaline gas and is one of the most abundant nitrogen-containing compounds in the atmosphere. It is an irritant with a characteristic pungent odor that is widely used in industry. Inasmuch as ammonia is highly soluble in water and, upon inhalation, is deposited in the upper airways, occupational exposures to ammonia have commonly been associated with sinusitis, upper airway irritation, and eye irritation. Acute exposures to high levels of ammonia have also been associated with diseases of the lower airways and interstitial lung. Small amounts of ammonia are naturally formed in nearly all tissues and organs of the vertebrate organism. Ammonia is both a neurotoxin and a metabotoxin. In fact, it is the most common endogenous neurotoxin. A neurotoxin is a compound that causes damage to neural tissue and neural cells. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Ammonia is recognized to be central in the pathogenesis of a brain condition known as hepatic encephalopathy, which arises from various liver diseases and leads to a build up ammonia in the blood (hyperammonemia). More than 40% of people with cirrhosis develop hepatic encephalopathy. Part of the neurotoxicity of ammonia arises from the fact that it easily crosses the blood-brain barrier and is absorbed and metabolized by the astrocytes, a population of cells in the brain that constitutes 30% of the cerebral cortex. Astrocytes use ammonia when synthesizing glutamine from glutamate. The increased levels of glutamine lead to an increase in osmotic pressure in the astrocytes, which become swollen. There is increased activity of the inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system, and the energy supply to other brain cells is decreased. This can be thought of as an example of brain edema. The source of the ammonia leading to hepatic encaphlopahy is not entirely clear. The gut produces ammonia, which is metabolized in the liver, and almost all organ systems are involved in ammonia metabolism. Colonic bacteria produce ammonia by splitting urea and other amino acids, however this does not fully explain hyperammonemia and hepatic encephalopathy. The alternative explanation is that hyperammonemia is the result of intestinal breakdown of amino acids, especially glutamine. The intestines have significant glutaminase activity, predominantly located in the enterocytes. On the other hand, intestinal tissues only have a little glutamine synthetase activity, making it a major glutamine-consuming organ. In addition to the intestine, the kidney is an important source of blood ammonia in patients with liver disease. Ammonia is also taken up by the muscle and brain in hepatic coma, and there is confirmation that ammonia is metabolized in muscle. Excessive formation of ammonia in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients has also been demonstrated, and it has been shown that some Alzheimer's disease patients exhibit elevated blood ammonia concentrations. Ammonia is the most important natural modulator of lysosomal protein processing. Indeed, there is strong evidence for the involvement of aberrant lysosomal processing of beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta-APP) in the formation of amyloid deposits. Inflammatory processes and activation of microglia are widely believed to be implicated in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. Ammonia is able to affect the characteristic functions of microglia, such as endocytosis, and cytokine production. Based on these facts, an ammonia-based hypothesis for Alzheimer's disease has been suggested (PMID: 17006913, 16167195, 15377862, 15369278). Chronically high levels of ammonia in the blood are associated with nearly twenty different inborn errors of metabolism including: 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency, 3-methyl-crotonylglycinuria, argininemia, argininosuccinic aciduria, beta-ketothiolase deficiency, biotinidase deficiency, carbamoyl phosphate synthetase deficiency, carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase deficiency, citrullinemia type I, hyperinsulinism-hyperammonemia syndrome, hyperornithinemia-hyperammonemia-homocitrullinuria syndrome, isovaleric aciduria, lysinuric protein intolerance, malonic aciduria, methylmalonic aciduria, methylmalonic aciduria due to cobalamin-related disorders, propionic acidemia, pyruvate carboxylase deficiency, and short chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (SCAD deficiency). Many of these inborn errors of metabolism are associated with urea cycle disorders or impairment to amino acid metabolism. High levels of ammonia in the blood (hyperammonemia) lead to the activation of NMDA receptors in the brain. This results in the depletion of brain ATP, which in turn leads to release of glutamate. Ammonia also leads to the impairment of mitochondrial function and calcium homeostasis, thereby decreasing ATP synthesis. Excess ammonia also increases the formation of nitric oxide (NO), which in turn reduces the activity of glutamine synthetase, and thereby decreases the elimination of ammonia in the brain (PMID: 12020609). As a neurotoxin, ammonia predominantly affects astrocytes. Disturbed mitochondrial function and oxidative stress, factors implicated in the induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition, appear to be involved in the mechanism of ammonia neurotoxicity. Ammonia can also affect the glutamatergic and GABAergic neuronal systems, the two prevailing neuronal systems of the cortical structures. All of these effects can lead to irreversible brain damage, coma, and/or death. Infants with urea cycle disorders and hyperammonia initially exhibit vomiting and increasing lethargy. If untreated, seizures, hypotonia (poor muscle tone, floppiness), respiratory distress (respiratory alkalosis), and coma can occur. Adults with urea cycle disorders and hyperammonia will exhibit episodes of disorientation, confusion, slurred speech, unusual and extreme combativeness or agitation, stroke-like symptoms, lethargy, and delirium. Ammonia also has toxic effects when an individual is exposed to ammonia solutions. Acute exposure to high levels of ammonia in air may be irritating to skin, eyes, throat, and lungs and cause coughing and burns. Lung damage and death may occur after exposure to very high concentrations of ammonia. Swallowing concentrated solutions of ammonia can cause burns in the mouth, throat, and stomach. Splashing ammonia into eyes can cause burns and even blindness.",Ammonia,HMDB0000051,,,C00014,AMMONIA,FDB003908,nh4,[H][N+]([H])([H])[H],[NH3]***Ammoniac***Ammoniak***Amoniaco***NH3***R-717***Spirit OF hartshorn***Ammonia anhydrous***Ammonia inhalant***Ammonia solution strong***Ammonia water***Liquid ammonia***Am-fol***Ammonia (CONC 20% or greater)***Ammonia gas***Ammonia solution***Ammonia solution strong (NF)***Ammonia water (JP15)***Ammoniacum gummi***Ammoniak kconzentrierter***Ammoniakgas***Ammonium ion***Anhydrous ammonia***Aromatic ammonia vaporole***Azane***NH(3)***nitro-Sil***Primaeres amin***Sekundaeres amin***Tertiaeres amin,QGZKDVFQNNGYKY-UHFFFAOYSA-O,InChI=1S/H3N/h1H3/p+1

It is present in many alloys in widespread use, including stainless steels. It may also be present as an impurity in any alloy. Nickel is used in the production of coins, jewellery, and nickel-cadmium batteries, and as a catalyst for the hydrogenation of liquid oils to solid fats such as oleomargarine and vegetable shortening. Nickel-containing dental alloys continue to be used successfully in the provision of various forms of dental care. Many of these alloys have applications in the construction of restorations designed to remain in clinical service for many years, including crowns, fixed bridgework, and removable partial dentures. Furthermore, nickel containing alloys find extensive application in orthodontics, including metallic brackets, arch wires, bands, springs and ligature wires. Many instruments and devises, for example, endodontic instruments also contain nickel. Allergic responses are mediated through the immune system. In a sensitized individual, allergic responses can be initiated by relatively small amounts of the allergen; for example, if nickel ions are released from a nickel plated material following direct and prolonged contact with the skin. Individuals are first sensitized to the allergen. Subsequent exposures, if sufficiently high, may then result in an allergic reaction. A number of allergens are used in the clinical practice of dentistry, notably eugenol, mercury, nickel, chromium, cobalt, components of resin-based materials and a host of other chemical agents. The majority of dental allergies, including allergic responses to nickel-containing dental alloys, comprise Type IV hypersensitivity reactions, cell-mediated by T-lymphocytes.

no,10102-43-9,16480,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): The biologically active molecule nitric oxide (NO) is a simple, membrane-permeable gas with unique chemistry. It is formed by the conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline, with the release of NO. The enzymatic oxidation of L-arginine to L-citrulline takes place in the presence of oxygen and NADPH using flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), flavin mononucleotide (FMN), heme, thiol and tetrahydrobiopterin as cofactors. The enzyme responsible for the generation of NO is nitric oxide synthase (E.C. 1.7.99.7; NOS). Three NOS isoforms have been described and shown to be encoded on three distinct genes: Neuronal NOS (nNOS, NOS type I), inducible NOS (NOS type II) and endothelial NOS (eNOS, NOS type III). Two of them are constitutively expressed and dependent on the presence of calcium ions and calmodulin to function (nNOS and eNOS), while iNOS is considered non-constitutive and calcium-independent. However, experience has shown that constitutive expression of nNOS and eNOS is not as rigid as previously thought (i.e., either present or absent), but can be dynamically controlled during development and in response to injury. Functionally, NO may act as a hormone, neurotransmitter, paracrine messenger, mediator, cytoprotective and cytotoxic molecule. NO has multiple cellular molecular targets. It influences the activity of transcription factors, modulates upstream signaling cascades, mRNA stability and translation, and processes the primary gene products. In the brain, many processes are linked to NO. NO activates its receptor, soluble guanylate cyclase by binding to it. The stimulation of this enzyme leads to increased synthesis of the second messenger, cGMP, which in turn activates cGMP-dependent kinases in target cells. NO exerts strong influence on glutamatergic neurotransmission by directly interacting with the N-Methyl-d-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor. Neuronal NOS is connected to NMDA receptors (see below) and sharply increases NO production following activation of this receptor. Thus, the level of endogenously produced NO around NMDA synapses reflects the activity of glutamate-mediated neurotransmission. However, there is recent evidence showing that non-NMDA glutamate receptors (i.e., AMPA and type I metabotropic receptors) also contribute to NO generation. Besides its influence on glutamate, NO is known to have effects on the storage, uptake and/or release of most other neurotransmitters in the CNS (acetylcholine, dopamine, noradrenaline, GABA, and taurine and glycine, as well as of certain neuropeptides. Finally, since NO is a highly diffusible molecule, it may reach extrasynaptic receptors at target cell membranes at some distance from the place of NO synthesis. NO is thus capable of mediating both synaptic and nonsynaptic communication processes. NO is a potent vasodilator (a major endogenous regulator of vascular tone), and an important endothelium-dependent relaxing factor. NO is synthesized by NO synthases (NOS) and NOS are inhibited by asymmetrical dimethylarginine (ADMA). ADMA is metabolized by dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) and excreted in the kidneys. Lower ADMA levels in pregnant women compared to non-pregnant controls suggest that ADMA has a role in vascular dilatation and blood pressure changes. Several studies show an increase in ADMA levels in pregnancies complicated with preeclampsia. Elevated ADMA levels in preeclampsia are seen before clinical symptoms have developed; these findings suggest that ADMA has a role in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. In some pulmonary hypertensive states such as ARDS, the production of endogenous NO may be impaired. Nitric oxide inhalation selectively dilates the pulmonary circulation. Significant systemic vasodilation does not occur because NO is inactivated by rapidly binding to hemoglobin. In an injured lung with pulmonary hypertension, inhaled NO produces local vasodilation of well-ventilated lung units and may ""steal"" blood flow away from unventilated regions. This reduces intrapulmonary shunting and may improve systemic arterial oxygenation. Nitric oxide is a chemical mediator fundamental in the maintenance of adequate tissue perfusion and effective cardiovascular function. The use of nitrates is well established as pharmacological agents but it is only recently that it has been recognized that they act as a source of nitric oxide.

The nitrate ion is a polyatomic anion with the empirical formula NO3- and a molecular mass of 62.01 daltons; it consists of one central nitrogen atom surrounded by three identical oxygen atoms in a trigonal planar arrangement. The nitrate ion carries a negative one formal charge. Nitrates should not be confused with nitrites, the salts of nitrous acid. Organic compounds containing the nitro functional group (which has the same formula and structure as the nitrate ion save that one of the O2 atoms is replaced by the R group) are known as nitro compounds. Nitrate ions can be toxic. In particular, nitrate toxicosis in humans occurs through enterohepatic metabolism of nitrates to ammonia, with nitrite being an intermediate. Nitrites oxidize the iron atoms in hemoglobin from Ferrous Iron (2+) to Ferric Iron (3+), rendering it unable to carry oxygen.

o2,7782-44-7,15379,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Oxygen is the third most abundant element in the universe after hydrogen and helium and the most abundant element by mass in the Earth's crust. Diatomic oxygen gas constitutes 20.9% of the volume of air. All major classes of structural molecules in living organisms, such as proteins, carbohydrates, and fats, contain oxygen, as do the major inorganic compounds that comprise animal shells, teeth, and bone. Oxygen in the form of O2 is produced from water by cyanobacteria, algae and plants during photosynthesis and is used in cellular respiration for all living organisms. Green algae and cyanobacteria in marine environments provide about 70% of the free oxygen produced on earth and the rest is produced by terrestrial plants. Oxygen is used in mitochondria to help generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) during oxidative phosphorylation. For animals, a constant supply of oxygen is indispensable for cardiac viability and function. To meet this demand, an adult human, at rest, inhales 1.8 to 2.4 grams of oxygen per minute. This amounts to more than 6 billion tonnes of oxygen inhaled by humanity per year. At a resting pulse rate, the heart consumes approximately 8-15 ml O2/min/100 g tissue. This is significantly more than that consumed by the brain (approximately 3 ml O2/min/100 g tissue) and can increase to more than 70 ml O2/min/100 g myocardial tissue during vigorous exercise. As a general rule, mammalian heart muscle cannot produce enough energy under anaerobic conditions to maintain essential cellular processes; thus, a constant supply of oxygen is indispensable to sustain cardiac function and viability. However, the role of oxygen and oxygen-associated processes in living systems is complex, and they and can be either beneficial or contribute to cardiac dysfunction and death (through reactive oxygen species). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are a family of oxygen-derived free radicals that are produced in mammalian cells under normal and pathologic conditions. Many ROS, such as the superoxide anion (O2-)and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), act within blood vessels, altering mechanisms mediating mechanical signal transduction and autoregulation of cerebral blood flow. Reactive oxygen species are believed to be involved in cellular signaling in blood vessels in both normal and pathologic states. The major pathway for the production of ROS is by way of the one-electron reduction of molecular oxygen to form an oxygen radical, the superoxide anion (O2-). Within the vasculature there are several enzymatic sources of O2-, including xanthine oxidase, the mitochondrial electron transport chain, and nitric oxide (NO) synthases. Studies in recent years, however, suggest that the major contributor to O2- levels in vascular cells is the membrane-bound enzyme NADPH-oxidase. Produced O2- can react with other radicals, such as NO, or spontaneously dismutate to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In cells, the latter reaction is an important pathway for normal O2- breakdown and is usually catalyzed by the enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD). Once formed, H2O2 can undergo various reactions, both enzymatic and nonenzymatic. The antioxidant enzymes catalase and glutathione peroxidase act to limit ROS accumulation within cells by breaking down H2O2 to H2O. Metabolism of H2O2 can also produce other, more damaging ROS. For example, the endogenous enzyme myeloperoxidase uses H2O2 as a substrate to form the highly reactive compound hypochlorous acid. Alternatively, H2O2 can undergo Fenton or Haber-Weiss chemistry, reacting with Fe2+/Fe3+ ions to form toxic hydroxyl radicals (-.OH).

o2s,11062-77-4,18421,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Superoxide is the anionic form O2. It is important as the product of the one-electron reduction of dioxygen (oxygen gas), which occurs widely in nature. With one unpaired electron, the superoxide ion is a free radical. It is also paramagnetic. The biological toxicity of superoxide is due to its capacity to inactivate iron-sulfur cluster containing enzymes (which are critical in a wide variety of metabolic pathways), thereby liberating free iron in the cell, which can undergo fenton-chemistry and generate the highly reactive hydroxyl radical. In its HO2 form, superoxide can also initiate lipid peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. It also reacts with carbonyl compounds and halogenated carbons to create toxic peroxy radicals. As such, superoxide is a main cause of oxidative stress. Highly reactive compounds produced when oxygen is reduced by a single electron. In biological systems, they may be generated during the normal catalytic function of a number of enzymes and during the oxidation of hemoglobin to Methemoglobin. Because superoxide is toxic, nearly all organisms living in the presence of oxygen contain isoforms of the superoxide scavenging enzyme, superoxide dismutase, or SOD. SOD is an extremely efficient enzyme; it catalyzes the neutralization of superoxide nearly as fast as the two can diffuse together spontaneously in solution. Genetic inactivation (""knockout"") of SOD produces deleterious phenotypes in organisms ranging from bacteria to mice. The latter species dies around 21 days after birth if the mitochondrial variant of SOD (Mn-SOD) is inactivated, and suffers from multiple pathologies, including reduced lifespan, liver cancer, muscle atrophy, cataracts and female infertility when the cytoplasmic (Cu, Zn -SOD) variant is inactivated. With one unpaired electron, the superoxide ion is a free radical and therefore paramagnetic.

ocdececrn,,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Vaccenyl carnitine is a long-chain acyl fatty acid derivative ester of carnitine. Long-chain acyl fatty acid derivatives accumulate in the cytosol and serum of patients suffering of mitochondrial carnitine palmitoyltransferase II (CPT II, EC 2.3.1.12) deficiency, the most common inherited disorder of lipid metabolism in adults. carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder of fatty acid metabolism presenting as two clinical phenotypes: (i) a severe infantile hepatocardiomuscular form and (ii) a milder adult muscular form. Energy production from long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) requires the transport of LCFAs into the mitochondrial matrix. This transport is carnitine-dependent and involves translocation machinery. mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation disorders cause hypoglycaemia, hepatic dysfunction, myopathy, cardiomyopathy and encephalopathy. Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing long-term haemodialysis exhibit elevated acylcarnitine concentrations.

oleth,111-58-0,116103,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): N-Oleoylethanolamine (NOE or OEA) is a N-acylethanolamine. N-acylethanolamines (NAEs) constitute a class of lipid compounds naturally present in both animal and plant membranes as constituents of the membrane-bound phospholipid, N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE). NAPE is composed of a third fatty acid moiety linked to the amino head group of the commonly occurring membrane phospholipid, phosphatidylethanolamine. NAEs are released from NAPE by phospholipase D-type hydrolases in response to a variety of stimuli. Transient NAE release and accumulation has been attributed a variety of biological activities, including neurotransmission, membrane protection, and immunomodulation in animals. N-oleoylethanolamine is an inhibitor of the sphingolipid signaling pathway, via specific ceramidase inhibition (ceramidase converts ceramide to sphingosine). N-oleoylethanolamine blocks the effects of TNF- and arachidonic acid on intracellular Ca concentration. (PMID: 12692337, 12056855, 12560208, 11997249). N-oleoyl ethanolamine is related to the endocannabinoid anandamide. Endocannabinoids signal through cannabinoid receptors (also stimulated by the active ingredient of cannabis) but although related in structure, synthesis and degradation to anandamide, NOE cannot be considered an endocannabinoid as it does not activate the cannabinoid receptors. Most of the reported responses to NOE can be attributed to activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha). Administration of NOE inhibits body weight gain in rats. In adipocytes and hepatocytes, NOE inhibits mitogenic and metabolic signaling by the insulin receptor and produces glucose intolerance. It also inhibits gastric emptying, which might act together with the sensory neuronal signals to achieve satiety. NOE is permanently elevated in diabetic obese patients. NOE also reduces visceral and inflammatory responses through a PPAR-alpha-activation independent mechanism (PMID: 17449181). NOE has been shown to be an antagonist of TRVP1 (the transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 receptor). Overall, NOE has beneficial effects on health by inducing food intake control, lipid beta-oxidation, body weight loss and analgesic effects (PMID: 18704536).",N-Oleoylethanolamine,HMDB0002088,,,,,FDB022839,oleth,[H]OC([H])([H])C([H])([H])N([H])C(=O)C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C(\[H])=C(\[H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])[H],"N-(2-Hydroxyethyl)-9-octadecenamide***N-(2-Hydroxyethyl)oleamide***N-(9Z-Octadecenoyl) ethanolamine***N-(9Z-Octadecenoyl)-ethanolamine***N-(cis-9-Octadecenoyl) ethanolamine***N-(Hydroxyethyl)oleamide***N-Oleoyl ethanolamine***OEA***Oleamide mea***Oleoyl 1-ethanolamide***Oleoyl monoethanolamide***Oleoylethanolamide***N-Oleoyl ethanolamine, oleoyl monoethanolamide, oleoylethanolamide***N-Oleoyl-2-aminoethanol***NOE***Oleic acid ethanolamide***Oleic acid monoethanolamide***N-OEA",BOWVQLFMWHZBEF-KTKRTIGZSA-N,"InChI=1S/C20H39NO2/c1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-11-12-13-14-15-16-17-20(23)21-18-19-22/h9-10,22H,2-8,11-19H2,1H3,(H,21,23)/b10-9-"

orn,3184-13-2,15729,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): L-ornithine, also known as (S)-2,5-diaminopentanoic acid or ornithine is a member of the class of compounds known as L-alpha-amino acids. L-alpha-amino acids are alpha amino acids which have the L-configuration of the alpha-carbon atom. L-ornithine is soluble (in water) and a moderately acidic compound. It has been claimed that ornithine improves athletic performance, has anabolic effects, has wound-healing effects, and is immuno-enhancing. L-ornithine is abundant in a number of food items such as wild rices, brazil nuts, common oregano, and common grapes. L-ornithine can be found throughout most human tissues; and in most biofluids, some of which include blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), sweat, saliva, and feces. Within the cell, L-ornithine is located in the mitochondria and the cytoplasm. L-ornithine exists in all living species, from bacteria to humans. In humans, L-ornithine is involved in numerous metabolic disorders, some of which include, ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTC deficiency), argininemia, and guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency (GAMT deficiency). Moreover, Ornithine is found to be associated with cystinuria, hyperdibasic aminoaciduria I, and lysinuric protein intolerance, which are inborn errors of metabolism. Ornithine is produced in the urea cycle through the cleavage of urea from arginine. It is a central part of the urea cycle, which allows for the disposal of excess nitrogen. L-Ornithine is also a precursor of citrulline and arginine. In order for ornithine produced in the cytosol to be converted to citrulline, it must first cross the inner mitochondrial membrane into the mitochondrial matrix where it is carbamylated by ornithine transcarbamylase. This transfer is mediated by the mitochondrial ornithine transporter (SLC25A15; AF112968; ORNT1). Mutations in the mitochondrial ornithine transporter result in hyperammonemia, hyperornithinemia, homocitrullinuria (HHH) syndrome, a disorder of the urea cycle (PMID: 16256388). The pathophysiology of the disease may involve diminished ornithine transport into mitochondria, resulting in ornithine accumulation in the cytoplasm and reduced ability to clear carbamoyl phosphate and ammonia loads (OMIM 838970).",Ornithine,HMDB0000214,,,C00077,L-ORNITHINE,FDB003654,orn,[H][N+]([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])[C@@]([H])(C([O-])=O)[N+]([H])([H])[H],"(S)-2,5-Diaminopentanoate***(S)-2,5-Diaminopentanoic acid***(S)-2,5-Diaminovaleric acid***(S)-alpha,delta-Diaminovaleric acid***(S)-Ornithine***(S)-2,5-Diaminovalerate***(S)-a,delta-Diaminovalerate***(S)-a,delta-Diaminovaleric acid***(S)-alpha,delta-Diaminovalerate***(S)-α,δ-diaminovalerate***(S)-α,δ-diaminovaleric acid***(S)-a,δ-diaminovalerate***(S)-a,δ-diaminovaleric acid***(+)-S-Ornithine***(S)-a,D-Diaminovalerate***(S)-a,D-Diaminovaleric acid***5-amino-L-Norvaline***L-(-)-Ornithine***L-Ornithine***2,5-Diaminopentanoic acid***Ornithine dihydrochloride, (L)-isomer***Ornithine hydrochloride, (D)-isomer***Ornithine, (D)-isomer***Ornithine, (L)-isomer***2,5 Diaminopentanoic acid***Ornithine monoacetate, (L)-isomer***Ornithine monohydrochloride, (D)-isomer***Ornithine monohydrochloride, (DL)-isomer***Ornithine phosphate (1:1), (L)-isomer***Ornithine sulfate (1:1), (L)-isomer***Ornithine hydrochloride, (DL)-isomer***Ornithine hydrochloride, (L)-isomer***Ornithine monohydrobromide, (L)-isomer***Ornithine, (DL)-isomer",AHLPHDHHMVZTML-BYPYZUCNSA-O,"InChI=1S/C5H12N2O2/c6-3-1-2-4(7)5(8)9/h4H,1-3,6-7H2,(H,8,9)/p+1/t4-/m0/s1"

orot,65-86-1,16742,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Orotic acid is a minor dietary constituent. Indeed, until it was realized that it could be synthesized by humans, orotic acid was known as vitamin B-13. The richest dietary sources of orotic acid are cow's milk and other dairy products as well as root vegetables such as carrots and beets. Dietary intake probably contributes to a basal rate of orotic acid excretion in urine because fasting decreases excretion by ~50%. However, it is now apparent that most urinary orotic acid is synthesized in the body, where it arises as an intermediate in the pathway for the synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides. Orotic acid is converted to UMP by UMP synthase, a multifunctional protein with both orotate phosphoribosyltransferase and orotidylate decarboxylase activity. The most frequently observed inborn error of pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis is a mutation of the multifunctional protein UMP synthase (UMP synthase deficiency or orotic aciduria). This disorder prevents the conversion of orotic acid to UMP, and thus to other pyrimidines. As a result, plasma orotic acid accumulates to high concentrations, and increased quantities appear in the urine. Indeed, urinary orotic acid is so markedly increased in individuals harboring a mutation in UMP synthase that orotic acid crystals can form in the urine. The urinary concentration of orotic acid in individuals suffering from orotic aciduria can be of the order of millimoles per millimole creatinine. By comparison, the urinary level in unaffected individuals is ~ 1 µmol/mmol creatinine (PMID: 17513443). Orotic aciduria is characterized by megaloblastic anemia and orotic acid crystalluria that is frequently associated with some degree of physical and mental retardation. These features respond to appropriate pyrimidine replacement therapy and most cases appear to have a good prognosis. When present in sufficiently high levels, orotic acid can act as an acidogen and a metabotoxin. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of orotic acid are associated with at least seven inborn errors of metabolism, including argininemia, LPI syndrome (lysinuric protein intolerance), hyperornithinemia-hyperammonemia-homocitrullinuria (HHH), OTC deficiency, citrullinemia type I, purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency, and orotic aciduria. Orotic acid is an organic acid. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy).

It is produced in the body by metabolism of glyoxylic acid or ascorbic acid. It is not metabolized but excreted in the urine. It is used as an analytical reagent and general reducing agent (Pubchem). Oxalic acid (IUPAC name: ethanedioic acid, formula H2C2O4) is a dicarboxylic acid with structure (HOOC)-(COOH). Because of the joining of two carboxyl groups, this is one of the strongest organic acids. It is also a reducing agent. The anions of oxalic acid as well as its salts and esters are known as oxalates (Wikipedia). Bodily oxalic acid may also be synthesized via the metabolism of either glyoxylic acid or unused ascorbic acid (vitamin C), which is a serious health consideration for long term megadosers of vitamin C supplements. 80% of kidney stones are formed from calcium oxalate. Some Aspergillus species produce oxalic acid, which reacts with blood or tissue calcium to precipitate calcium oxalate. There is some preliminary evidence that the administration of probiotics can affect oxalic acid excretion rates (and presumably oxalic acid levels as well) (Wikipedia).

Excess phenylalanine in the body can be disposed of through a transamination process leading to the production of phenylpyruvate. The phenylpyruvate can be further metabolized into a number of products. Decarboxylation of phenylpyruvate gives phenylacetate, while a reduction reaction gives phenyllactate. The phenylacetate can be further conjugated with glutamine to give phenylacetyl glutamine. All of these metabolites can be detected in serum and urine of PKU patients. Phenyl acetate is also produced endogenously as the metabolite of 2-Phenylethylamine, which is mainly metabolized by monoamine oxidase to form phenyl acetate. 2-phenylethylamine is an ""endogenous amphetamine"" which may modulate central adrenergic functions, and the urinary phenyl acetate levels have been postulated as a marker for depression.

Ether lipids are lipids in which one or more of the carbon atoms on glycerol is bonded to an alkyl chain via an ether linkage, as opposed to the usual ester linkage.While most phospholipids have a saturated fatty acid on C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid on C-2 of the glycerol backbone, the fatty acid distribution at the C-1 and C-2 positions of glycerol within phospholipids is continually in flux, owing to phospholipid degradation and the continuous phospholipid remodeling that occurs while these molecules are in membranes. PCs can be synthesized via three different routes. In one route, choline is activated first by phosphorylation and then by coupling to CDP prior to attachment to phosphatidic acid.

It can be generated from Pantatheine (via pantothenate kinase 1) or R-4'-Phospho-pantothenoyl-L-cysteine (via phosphopantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase) or Dephospho-CoA (via 4'-phosphopantetheine adenylyl-transferase and ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase). In most mammals, coenzyme A can be hydrolyzed to pantetheine and pantothenate in the intestinal lumen via the following series of reactions: coenzyme A leads to phosphopantetheine leads to pantetheine leads to pantothenate. The conversion of 4'-phosphopantetheine (4'-PP) to dephospho-CoA, is catalyzed by 4'-phosphopantetheine adenylyl-transferase. In mammalian systems, this step may occur in the mitochondria or in the cytosol. (PMID: 1746161) It has been identified as an essential cofactor in in the biosynthesis of fatty acids, polyketides, depsipeptides, peptides, and compounds derived from both carboxylic and amino acid precursors. In particular it is a key prosthetic group of acyl carrier protein (ACP) and peptidyl carrier proteins (PCP) and aryl carrier proteins (ArCP) derived from Coenzyme A. Phosphopantetheine fulfils two demands. Firstly, the intermediates remain covalently linked to the synthases (or synthetases) in an energy-rich thiol ester linkage.

pap,1053-73-2,17985,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Adenosine 3', 5'-diphosphate or PAP is a nucleotide that is closely related to ADP. It has two phosphate groups attached to the 5' and 3' positions of the pentose sugar ribose (instead of pyrophosphoric acid at the 5' position, as found in ADP), and the nucleobase adenine. PAP is converted to PAPS by Sulfotransferase and then back to PAP after the sulfotransferase reaction. Sulfotransferase (STs) catalyze the transfer reaction of the sulfate group from the ubiquitous donor 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) to an acceptor group of numerous substrates. This reaction, often referred to as sulfuryl transfer, sulfation, or sulfonation, is widely observed from bacteria to humans and plays a key role in various biological processes such as cell communication, growth and development, and defense. PAP also appears to a role in bipolar depression. Phosphatases converting 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphate (PAP) into adenosine 5'-phosphate are of fundamental importance in living cells as the accumulation of PAP is toxic to several cellular systems.

pb,,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Lead is one of the oldest known and most widely studied occupational and environmental toxins. Despite intensive study, there is still vigorous debate about the toxic effects of lead, both from low level exposure in the general population owing to environmental pollution and historic use of lead in paint and plumbing and from exposure in the occupational setting. The majority of industries historically associated with high lead exposure have made dramatic advances in their control of occupational exposure. However, cases of unacceptably high exposure and even of frank lead poisoning are still seen, predominantly in the demolition and tank cleaning industries. Nevertheless, in most industries blood lead levels have declined below levels at which signs or symptoms are seen and the current focus of attention is on the subclinical effects of exposure. The significance of some of these effects for the overt health of the workers is often the subject of debate. Inevitably there is pressure to reduce lead exposure in the general population and in working environments, but any legislation must be based on a genuine scientific evaluation of the available evidence. Physiologically, it exists as an ion in the body. Inorganic lead is undoubtedly one of the oldest occupational toxins and evidence of lead poisoning can be found dating back to Roman times. As industrial lead production started at least 5000 years ago, it is likely that outbreaks of lead poisoning occurred from this time. These episodes of poisoning were not limited to lead workers. The general population could be significantly exposed owing to poorly glazed ceramic ware, the use of lead solder in the food canning industry, high levels of lead in drinking water, the use of lead compounds in paint and cosmetics and by deposition on crops and dust from industrial and motor vehicle sources. It was an important cause of morbidity and mortality during the Industrial Revolution and effective formal control of lead workers did not occur until the pioneering occupational health work of Ronald Lane in 1949. At very high blood lead levels, lead is a powerful abortifacient. At lower levels, it has been associated with miscarriages and low birth weights of infants. Predominantly to protect the developing fetus, legislation for lead workers often includes lower exposure criteria for women of reproductive capacity. Studies have shown a slowing of sensory motor reaction time in male lead workers and some disturbance of cognitive function in workers with blood lead levels >40 ig/100 ml. Peripheral motor neuropathy is seen as a result of chronic high-level lead exposure, but there is conflicting, although on the whole convincing, evidence of a reduction in peripheral nerve conduction velocity at lower blood lead levels. The threshold has been suggested to be as low as 30 ug/100 ml, although other studies have not seen effects below a blood lead level of 70 ug/100 ml. Several large epidemiological studies of lead workers have found inconclusive evidence of an association between lead exposure and the incidence of cancer. However, based on closer analysis the increase did not appear to be related to lead exposure. There was also a small but significant increase in the incidence of lung cancer, but this could have been the result of confounding from cigarette smoking or concurrent arsenic exposure. There is some evidence in humans that there is an association between low level lead exposure and blood pressure, but the results are inconsistent. Lead appears to reduce the resistance and increase the mortality of experimental animals. It apparently impairs antibody production and decreases immunoglobulin plaque forming cells. There is some evidence for suggesting that workers with blood lead levels between 20 and 85 ug/100 ml may have an increased susceptibility to colds, but a study of lead workers with blood lead levels less than 50 ug/100 ml showed no significant immunological changes. Although it is widely accepted that personal hygiene is the most important determinant of an individual's blood lead level, recent interesting information has shown that genetic polymorphism may also have an impact. The use of most of these chemicals is declining with the gradual demise of the use of lead in petrol, but lead naphthenates and stearates are still used in stabilizers for plastics and as lead 'soaps'. In fact, the only compound now produced for petrol usage is tetraethyl lead. Exposure is only seen during the production, transportation and blending of this substance into petrol and in workers involved in cleaning storage tanks that have contained leaded petrol. It is in this final group, the tank cleaners, where the highest potential morbidity and mortality may be seen. (PMID: 15020724).",Lead,HMDB0004628,,,,,,,,,,

pcholn24_hs,,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): LysoPC(24:0) is a lysophospholipid (LyP). It is a monoglycerophospholipid in which a phosphorylcholine moiety occupies a glycerol substitution site. Lysophosphatidylcholines can have different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached at the C-1 (sn-1) position. Fatty acids containing 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. LysoPC(24:0), in particular, consists of one chain of lignoceric acid at the C-1 position. The lignoceric acid moiety is derived from groundnut oil. Lysophosphatidylcholine is found in small amounts in most tissues. It is formed by hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine by the enzyme phospholipase A2, as part of the de-acylation/re-acylation cycle that controls its overall molecular species composition. It can also be formed inadvertently during extraction of lipids from tissues if the phospholipase is activated by careless handling. In blood plasma significant amounts of lysophosphatidylcholine are formed by a specific enzyme system, lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), which is secreted from the liver.

Lysophosphatidylcholines can have different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached at the C-1 (sn-1) position. Fatty acids containing 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. LysoPC(18:0), in particular, consists of one chain of stearic acid at the C-1 position. The stearic acid moiety is derived from animal fats, coco butter and sesame oil. Lysophosphatidylcholine is found in small amounts in most tissues. It is formed by hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine by the enzyme phospholipase A2, as part of the de-acylation/re-acylation cycle that controls its overall molecular species composition. It can also be formed inadvertently during extraction of lipids from tissues if the phospholipase is activated by careless handling. In blood plasma significant amounts of lysophosphatidylcholine are formed by a specific enzyme system, lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), which is secreted from the liver. The enzyme catalyzes the transfer of the fatty acids of position sn-2 of phosphatidylcholine to the free cholesterol in plasma, with formation of cholesterol esters and lysophosphatidylcholine.

pcreat,67-07-2,17287,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Phosphocreatine undergoes irreversible cyclization and dehydration to form creatinine at a fractional rate of 0.026 per day, thus forming approximately 2 g creatinine/day in an adult male. This is the amount of creatine that must be provided either from dietary sources or by endogenous synthesis to maintain the body pool of (creatine and) phosphocreatine. Creatine is an amino acid that plays a vital role as phosphocreatine in regenerating adenosine triphosphate in skeletal muscle to energize muscle contraction. Creatine is phosphorylated to phosphocreatine in muscle in a reaction that is catalyzed by the enzyme creatine kinase. This enzyme is in highest concentration in muscle and nerve. Oral administration increases muscle stores. During the past decade, creatine has assumed prominence as an ergogenic (and legal) aid for professional and elite athletes. Most (~ 95%) of the total body creatine-phosphocreatine pool is in muscle (more in skeletal muscle than in smooth muscle) and amounts to 120 g (or 925 mmol) in a 70 kg adult male. Approximately 60-67% of the content in resting muscle is in the phosphorylated form. This generates enough ATP at the myofibrillar apparatus to power about 4 seconds of muscle contraction in exercise. Phosphocreatine reacts with ADP to yield ATP and creatine; the reversible reaction is catalyzed by creatine kinase. phosphocreatine is the chief store of high-energy phosphates in muscle. Thus, this reaction, which permits the rephosphorylation of ADP to ATP, is the immediate source of energy in muscle contraction. During rest, metabolic processes regenerate phosphocreatine stores. In normal muscle, ATP that is broken down to ADP is immediately rephosphorylated to ATP. Thus, phosphocreatine serves as a reservoir of ATP-synthesizing potential. phosphocreatine is the only fuel available to precipitously regenerate ATP during episodes of rapid fluctuations in demand. The availability of phosphocreatine likely limits muscle performance during brief, high-power exercise, i.e., maximal exercise of short duration. With near maximal isometric contraction, the rate of utilization of phosphocreatine declines after 1-2 seconds of contraction, prior to the glycolysis peak at approximately 3 seconds.

pcresol,106-44-5,17847,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): p-Cresol (4-methylphenol), a 108.1 Da volatile low-molecular-weight compound, is a phenol. It is a partially lipophilic moiety which strongly binds to plasma protein (close to 100%) under normal conditions. p-Cresol is metabolized through conjugation, mainly sulphation and glucuronization, but removal of the unconjugated p-cresol is, at least in part, via the urine. Therefore it is not surprising that this compound, together with several other phenoles, is retained when the kidneys fail. P-Cresol is an end-product of protein breakdown, and an increase of the nutritional protein load in healthy individuals results in enhanced generation and urinary excretion. The serum p-cresol concentration in uremic patients can be decreased by changing to a low-protein diet. p-Cresol is one of the metabolites of the amino acid tyrosine, and to a certain extent also of phenylalanine, which are converted to 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid by intestinal bacteria, before being decarboxylated to p-cresol (putrefaction). The main contributing bacteria are aerobes (mainly enterobacteria), but to a certain extent also anaerobes play a role (mainly Clostridium perfringens). In uremia, modifications in the intestinal flora result in the specific overgrowth of bacteria that are specific p-cresol producers. The administration of antibiotics reduces urinary excretion of p-cresol, as a result of the liquidation of the producing bacteria. Environmental factors might also contribute. The liver cytochrome P450 metabolizes toluene to benzyl alcohol, but also to o-cresol and p-cresol. Toluene is not only used industrially, but it is also the most widely abusively inhaled solvent. Furthermore, p-cresol is a metabolite of menthofuran, one of the metabolites of R-(+)-pulegone, which is found in extracts from the plants Mentha pulegium and Hedeoma pulegioides, commonly known as pennyroyal oil and pennyroyal tea. These extracts are popular as unconventional herbal therapeutic agents and are applied as abortiva, diaphoretics, emmenagogues, and psychedelic drugs. Pennyroyal oil is extensively used for its pleasant mint-like smell in the flavoring industry. The toxicity of pennyroyal oil and menthofuran is well known. Another compound used in traditional medicine, especially in Japan, which is a precursor of p-cresol is wood tar creosote. p-Cresol has been reported to affect several biochemical, biological and physiological functions: (i) it diminishes the oxygen uptake of rat cerebral cortex slices; (ii) it increases the free active drug concentration of warfarin and diazepam; (iii) it has been related to growth retardation in the weanling pig; (iv) it alters cell membrane permeability, at least in bacteria; (v) it induces LDH leakage from rat liver slices; (vi) it induces susceptibility to auditive epileptic crises; and (vii) it blocks cell K+ channels. (PMID: 10570076). p-Cresol is a uremic toxin that is at least partially removed by peritoneal dialysis in haemodialysis patients, and has been involved in the progression of renal failure.

peamn,64-04-0,18397,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Phenethylamine (PEA) is an aromatic amine, which is a colorless liquid at room temperature. It is soluble in water, ethanol, and ether. Similar to other low-molecular-weight amines, it has a fishy odor. Upon exposure to air, it forms a solid carbonate salt with carbon dioxide. Phenethylamine is strongly basic and forms a stable crystalline hydrochloride salt with a melting point of 217 oC. Phenethylamine is also a skin irritant and possible sensitizer. Phenethylamine also has a constitutional isomer (+)-phenylethylamine (1-phenylethylamine), which has two stereoisomers: (R)-(+)-1-phenylethylamine and (S)-(-)-1-phenylethylamine. In the human brain, 2-phenethylamine is believed to function as a neuromodulator or neurotransmitter (a trace amine). Phenethylamine can be biosynthesized from the amino acid phenylalanine by enzymatic decarboxylation. It is also found in many foods such as chocolate, especially after microbial fermentation. However trace amounts from food are quickly metabolized by the enzyme MAO-B (into phenylacetic acid), preventing significant concentrations from reaching the brain. Phenylethylamine is a precursor to the neurotransmitter phenylethanolamine. High levels of PEA have been found in the urine of schizophrenics but it is not significantly elevated in the serum or CSF of schizophrenics (PMID: 7906896, PMID: 7360842).  Urinary levels of PEA are significantly lower in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (PMID: 12205654).  It has been found that PEA is the primary compound found in carnivore (especially cat) urine that leads to rodent (mouse and rat) avoidance. In other words, phenylethylamine is useful for scaring off rodent pests.  Quantitative HPLC analysis across 38 mammalian species has shown that PEA production in urine is especially enhanced in carnivores, with some producing >3,000-fold more than herbivores (PMID: 21690383).",Phenylethylamine,HMDB0012275,,,C05332,PHENYLETHYLAMINE,FDB010580,peamn,[H]C1=C([H])C([H])=C(C([H])=C1[H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])[N+]([H])([H])[H],"Benzeneethanamine***beta-Aminoethylbenzene***beta-Phenethylamine***beta-Phenylethylamine***Phenethylamine***b-Aminoethylbenzene***β-aminoethylbenzene***b-Phenethylamine***β-phenethylamine***b-Phenylethylamine***β-phenylethylamine***(2-Aminoethyl)benzene***(2-Aminoethyl)polystyrene***1-amino-2-Phenylethane***1-Phenethylamine***1-Phenyl-2-amino-athan***1-Phenyl-2-aminoethane***1TNJ***1Utm***1Uto***2-amino-1-Phenylethane***2-amino-Fenylethan***2-Fenylethylamin***2-Phenethylamine***2-Phenyl-ethanamine***2-Phenylethanamine***2-Phenylethanamine (acd/name 4.0)***2-Phenylethylamine***2-Phenylethylamine (acd/name 4.0)***b-Phenylaethylamin***Benzeneethanamine hydrochloride***beta Phenethylamine***beta-Phenylaethylamin***Omega-phenylethylamine***PEA***Phenethylamine hydrochloride***Polystyrene a-NH2***Phenethylamine hydrobromide***Phenethylamine tosylate***Phenethylamine conjugate acid***Phenethylamine sulfate***Phenethylamine, monolithium salt***2-Phenylethylammonium chloride***Phenethylamine sulfate (2:1)***Phenethylamine, 15N-labeled CPD***Phenethylamine mesylate***Phenethylamine perchlorate***Phenethylamine, beta-(14)C-labeled CPD",BHHGXPLMPWCGHP-UHFFFAOYSA-O,"InChI=1S/C8H11N/c9-7-6-8-4-2-1-3-5-8/h1-5H,6-7,9H2/p+1"

It has a high energy phosphate bond, and is involved in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. In glycolysis, PEP is formed by the action of the enzyme enolase on 2-phosphoglycerate. Metabolism of PEP to pyruvate by pyruvate kinase (PK) generates 1 molecule of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) via substrate-level phosphorylation. ATP is one of the major currencies of chemical energy within cells. In gluconeogenesis, PEP is formed from the decarboxylation of oxaloacetate and hydrolysis of 1 guanosine triphosphate molecule. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). This reaction is a rate-limiting step in gluconeogenesis.

phe_L,63-91-2,17295,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Phenylalanine is an essential amino acid and the precursor of the amino acid tyrosine. Like tyrosine, phenylalanine is also a precursor for catecholamines including tyramine, dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. Catecholamines are neurotransmitters that act as adrenalin-like substances. Interestingly, several psychotropic drugs (mescaline, morphine, codeine, and papaverine) also have phenylalanine as a constituent. Phenylalanine is highly concentrated in the human brain and plasma. Normal metabolism of phenylalanine requires biopterin, iron, niacin, vitamin B6, copper, and vitamin C. An average adult ingests 5 g of phenylalanine per day and may optimally need up to 8 g daily. Phenylalanine is highly concentrated in a number of high protein foods, such as meat, cottage cheese, and wheat germ. An additional dietary source of phenylalanine is artificial sweeteners containing aspartame. As a general rule, aspartame should be avoided by phenylketonurics and pregnant women. When present in sufficiently high levels, phenylalanine can act as a neurotoxin and a metabotoxin. A neurotoxin is a compound that disrupts or attacks neural cells and neural tissue. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of phenylalanine are associated with at least five inborn errors of metabolism, including Hartnup disorder, hyperphenylalaninemia due to guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase deficiency, phenylketonuria (PKU), tyrosinemia type 2 (or Richner-Hanhart syndrome), and tyrosinemia type III (TYRO3). Phenylketonurics have elevated serum plasma levels of phenylalanine up to 400 times normal. High plasma concentrations of phenylalanine influence the blood-brain barrier transport of large neutral amino acids. The high plasma phenylalanine concentrations increase phenylalanine entry into the brain and restrict the entry of other large neutral amino acids (PMID: 19191004). Phenylalanine has been found to interfere with different cerebral enzyme systems. Untreated phenylketonuria (PKU) can lead to intellectual disability, seizures, behavioural problems, and mental disorders. It may also result in a musty smell and lighter skin. Classic PKU dramatically affects myelination and white matter tracts in untreated infants; this may be one major cause of neurological disorders associated with phenylketonuria. Mild phenylketonuria can act as an unsuspected cause of hyperactivity, learning problems, and other developmental problems in children. It has been recently suggested that PKU may resemble amyloid diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, due to the formation of toxic amyloid-like assemblies of phenylalanine (PMID: 22706200). Phenylalanine also has some potential benefits. Phenylalanine can act as an effective pain reliever. Its use in premenstrual syndrome and Parkinson's may enhance the effects of acupuncture and electric transcutaneous nerve stimulation (TENS). Phenylalanine and tyrosine, like L-DOPA, produce a catecholamine-like effect. Phenylalanine is better absorbed than tyrosine and may cause fewer headaches. Low phenylalanine diets have been prescribed for certain cancers with mixed results. For instance, some tumours use more phenylalanine than others (particularly melatonin-producing tumours called melanomas).",L-Phenylalanine,HMDB0000159,,,C00079,PHE,FDB014705,phe_L,[H]C1=C([H])C([H])=C(C([H])=C1[H])C([H])([H])[C@@]([H])(C([O-])=O)[N+]([H])([H])[H],"(S)-2-amino-3-Phenylpropionic acid***(S)-alpha-amino-beta-Phenylpropionic acid***3-Phenyl-L-alanine***beta-Phenyl-L-alanine***F***Phe***PHENYLALANINE***(S)-2-amino-3-Phenylpropionate***(S)-a-amino-b-Phenylpropionate***(S)-a-amino-b-Phenylpropionic acid***(S)-alpha-amino-beta-Phenylpropionate***(S)-α-amino-β-phenylpropionate***(S)-α-amino-β-phenylpropionic acid***b-Phenyl-L-alanine***β-phenyl-L-alanine***(-)-beta-Phenylalanine***(L)-Phenylalanine***(S)-(-)-Phenylalanine***(S)-2-amino-3-Phenylpropanoate***(S)-2-amino-3-Phenylpropanoic acid***(S)-alpha-amino-Benzenepropanoate***(S)-alpha-amino-Benzenepropanoic acid***(S)-alpha-Aminobenzenepropanoate***(S)-alpha-Aminobenzenepropanoic acid***(S)-alpha-Aminohydrocinnamate***(S)-alpha-Aminohydrocinnamic acid***(S)-Phenylalanine***alpha-Aminohydrocinnamate***alpha-Aminohydrocinnamic acid***beta-Phenyl-alpha-alanine***beta-Phenylalanine***L-2-amino-3-Phenylpropionate***L-2-amino-3-Phenylpropionic acid***Phenyl-alanine***Phenylalamine***L-Isomer phenylalanine***Phenylalanine, L isomer***Phenylalanine, L-isomer***Endorphenyl",COLNVLDHVKWLRT-QMMMGPOBSA-N,"InChI=1S/C9H11NO2/c10-8(9(11)12)6-7-4-2-1-3-5-7/h1-5,8H,6,10H2,(H,11,12)/t8-/m0/s1"

Phenylacetylglutamine is a major nitrogenous metabolite that accumulates in uremia. (PMID: 2791363; PMID: 8972626). It has been shown that over 50% of urine phenylacetylglutamine may be derived from kidney conjugation of free plasma phenylacetic acid and/or from the kidney's preferential filtration of conjugated phenylacetic acid (PMID: 6420430). In enzymology, a glutamine N-phenylacetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.14) is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction. phenylacetyl-CoA + L-glutamine CoA + alpha-N-phenylacetyl-L-glutamine. Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are phenylacetyl-CoA and L-glutamine, whereas its two products are CoA and alpha-N-phenylacetyl-L-glutamine.(Wikipedia).",Alpha-N-Phenylacetyl-L-glutamine,HMDB0006344,,,C04148,CPD-1097,FDB023896,pheacgln,[H]OC(=O)[C@@]([H])(N([H])C(=O)C([H])([H])C1=C([H])C([H])=C([H])C([H])=C1[H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C(=O)N([H])[H],Phenylacetyl-L-glutamine***Phenylacetylglutamine***N2-(2-Phenylacetyl)-L-glutamine***a-N-Phenylacetyl-L-glutamine***Α-N-phenylacetyl-L-glutamine***N(2)-(Phenylacetyl)-L-glutamine***N(2)-(2-Phenylacetyl)-L-glutamine***N-Phenylacetylglutamine***N2-(Phenylacetyl)-L-glutamine***α-N-Phenylacetylglutamine***alpha-N-Phenylacetylglutamine***alpha-N-Phenylacetyl-L-glutamine,JFLIEFSWGNOPJJ-JTQLQIEISA-N,"InChI=1S/C13H16N2O4/c14-11(16)7-6-10(13(18)19)15-12(17)8-9-4-2-1-3-5-9/h1-5,10H,6-8H2,(H2,14,16)(H,15,17)(H,18,19)/t10-/m0/s1"

phenol,,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Phenol, is a toxic, colourless crystalline solid with a sweet tarry odor that resembles a hospital smell. It is commonly used as an antiseptic and disinfectant. It is active against a wide range of micro-organisms including some fungi and viruses, but is only slowly effective against spores. It has been used to disinfect skin and to relieve itching. Phenol is also used in the preparation of cosmetics including sunscreens, hair dyes, and skin lightening preparations. It is also used in the production of drugs (it is the starting material in the industrial production of aspirin), weedkillers, and synthetic resins. Phenol can be found in areas with high levels of motor traffic, therefore, people living in crowded urban areas are frequently exposed to traffic-derived phenol vapor. The average (mean +/- SD) phenol concentration in urine among normal individuals living in urban areas is 7.4 +/- 2.2 mg/g of creatinine. Exposure of the skin to concentrated phenol solutions causes chemical burns which may be severe; in laboratories where it is used, it is usually recommended that polyethylene glycol solution is kept available for washing off splashes. Notwithstanding the effects of concentrated solutions, it is also used in cosmetic surgery as an exfoliant, to remove layers of dead skin (Wikipedia). In some bacteria phenol can be directly synthesized from tyrosine via the enzyme tyrosine phenol-lyase [EC:4.1.99.2].",Phenol,HMDB0000228,,,,,,,,,,

phpyr,156-06-9,30851,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Phenylpyruvic acid is a keto-acid that is an intermediate or catabolic byproduct of phenylalanine metabolism. It has a slight honey-like odor. Levels of phenylpyruvate are normally very low in blood or urine. High levels of phenylpyruvic acid can be found in the urine of individuals with phenylketonuria (PKU), an inborn error of metabolism. PKU is due to lack of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), so that phenylalanine is converted not to tyrosine but to phenylpyruvic acid. In particular, excessive phenylalanine can be metabolized into phenylketones through, a transaminase pathway route involving glutamate. Metabolites of this transamination reaction include phenylacetate, phenylpyruvate and phenethylamine. In persons with PKU, dietary phenylalanine either accumulates in the body or some of it is converted to phenylpyruvic acid. Individuals with PKU tend to excrete large quantities of phenylpyruvate, phenylacetate and phenyllactate, along with phenylalanine, in their urine. If untreated, mental retardation effects and microcephaly are evident by the first year along with other symptoms which include: unusual irritability, epileptic seizures and skin lesions. Hyperactivity, EEG abnormalities and seizures, and severe learning disabilities are major clinical problems later in life. A ""musty or mousy"" odor of skin, hair, sweat and urine (due to phenylacetate accumulation); and a tendency to hypopigmentation and eczema are also observed. The neural-development effects of PKU are primarily due to the disruption of neurotransmitter synthesis. In particular, phenylalanine is a large, neutral amino acid which moves across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) via the large neutral amino acid transporter (LNAAT). Excessive phenylalanine in the blood saturates the transporter. Thus, excessive levels of phenylalanine significantly decrease the levels of other LNAAs in the brain. But since these amino acids are required for protein and neurotransmitter synthesis, phenylalanine accumulation disrupts brain development, leading to mental retardation.",Phenylpyruvic acid,HMDB0000205,,,C00166,PHENYL-PYRUVATE,FDB020197,phpyr,[H]C1=C([H])C([H])=C(C([H])=C1[H])C([H])([H])C(=O)C([O-])=O,"3-Phenyl-2-oxopropanoate***3-Phenyl-2-oxopropanoic acid***3-PHENYLPYRUVIC ACID***alpha-Ketohydrocinnamic acid***alpha-oxo-Benzenepropanoic acid***beta-Phenylpyruvic acid***keto-Phenylpyruvate***Phenylbrenztraubensaeure***Phenylpyruvate***3-PHENYLPYRUVate***a-Ketohydrocinnamate***a-Ketohydrocinnamic acid***alpha-Ketohydrocinnamate***α-ketohydrocinnamate***α-ketohydrocinnamic acid***a-oxo-Benzenepropanoate***a-oxo-Benzenepropanoic acid***alpha-oxo-Benzenepropanoate***α-oxo-benzenepropanoate***α-oxo-benzenepropanoic acid***b-Phenylpyruvate***b-Phenylpyruvic acid***beta-Phenylpyruvate***β-phenylpyruvate***β-phenylpyruvic acid***keto-Phenylpyruvic acid***2-Hydroxy-3-phenyl-2-propenoic acid, 9ci***2-oxo-3-Phenylpropanoate***2-oxo-3-Phenylpropanoic acid***2-oxo-3-Phenylpropanoic acid (mixture oxo and keto)***a-Hydroxycinnamic acid***a-Oxobenzenepropanoic acid, 9ci***FEMA 3892***Phenylpyroracemate***Phenylpyroracemic acid***Phenylpyruvic acid, calcium salt***Phenylpyruvic acid, sodium salt",BTNMPGBKDVTSJY-UHFFFAOYSA-M,"InChI=1S/C9H8O3/c10-8(9(11)12)6-7-4-2-1-3-5-7/h1-5H,6H2,(H,11,12)/p-1"

phyt,14721-66-5,16285,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Phytanic acid (or 3,7,11,15-tetramethylhexadecanoic acid) is a 20-carbon branched-chain fatty acid that humans can obtain through the consumption of dairy products, ruminant animal fats, and certain fish. It is primarily formed by bacterial degradation of chlorophyll in the intestinal tract of ruminants. Unlike most fatty acids, phytanic acid cannot be metabolized by beta-oxidation (because of a methyl group in the beta position). Instead, it undergoes alpha-oxidation in the peroxisome, where it is converted into pristanic acid by the removal of one carbon. Pristanic acid can undergo several rounds of beta-oxidation in the peroxisome to form medium-chain fatty acids that can be converted into carbon dioxide and water in mitochondria. Refsum disease, an autosomal recessive neurological disorder caused by mutations in the PHYH gene, is characterized by having impaired alpha-oxidation activity. Individuals with Refsum disease accumulate large stores of phytanic acid in their blood and tissues. This frequently leads to peripheral polyneuropathy, cerebellar ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa, anosmia, and hearing loss. Therefore, chronically high levels of phytanic acid can be neurotoxic. Phytanic acid's neurotoxicity appears to lie in its ability to initiate astrocyte/neural cell death by activating the mitochondrial route of apoptosis. In particular, phytanic acid can induce the substantial generation of reactive oxygen species in isolated mitochondria as well as in intact cells.

Carotenoids are isoprenoid molecules that are widespread in nature and are typically seen as pigments in fruits, flowers, birds and crustacea. Animals are unable to synthesise carotenoids de novo, and rely upon the diet as a source of these compounds. Over recent years there has been considerable interest in dietary carotenoids with respect to their potential in alleviating age-related diseases in humans. This attention has been mirrored by significant advances in cloning most of the carotenoid genes and in the genetic manipulation of crop plants with the intention of increasing levels in the diet. Studies have shown an inverse relationship between the consumption of certain fruits and vegetables and the risk of epithelial cancer. Since carotenoids are among the micronutrients found in cancer preventive foods, detailed qualitative and quantitative determination of these compounds, particularly in fruits and vegetables and in human plasma, have recently become increasingly important.

pi,14265-44-2,18367,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Phosphate is a salt of phosphoric acid. In organic chemistry, a phosphate, or organophosphate, is an ester of phosphoric acid. Organic phosphates are important in biochemistry, biogeochemistry and ecology. Phosphate (Pi) is an essential component of life. In biological systems, phosphorus is found as a free phosphate ion in solution and is called inorganic phosphate, to distinguish it from phosphates bound in various phosphate esters. Inorganic phosphate is generally denoted Pi and at physiological (neutral) pH primarily consists of a mixture of HPO<sup>2-</sup><sub>4</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>PO<sup>-</sup><sub>4</sub> ions. phosphates are most commonly found in the form of adenosine phosphates, (AMP, ADP and ATP) and in DNA and RNA and can be released by the hydrolysis of ATP or ADP. Similar reactions exist for the other nucleoside diphosphates and triphosphates. Phosphoanhydride bonds in ADP and ATP, or other nucleoside diphosphates and triphosphates, contain high amounts of energy which give them their vital role in all living organisms. Phosphate must be actively transported into cells against its electrochemical gradient. In vertebrates, two unrelated families of Na+-dependent Pi transporters carry out this task. Remarkably, the two families transport different Pi species: whereas type II Na+/Pi cotransporters (SCL34) prefer divalent HPO4(2), type III Na+/Pi cotransporters (SLC20) transport monovalent H2PO4. The SCL34 family comprises both electrogenic and electroneutral members that are expressed in various epithelia and other polarized cells. Through regulated activity in apical membranes of the gut and kidney, they maintain body Pi homeostasis, and in salivary and mammary glands, liver, and testes they play a role in modulating the Pi content of luminal fluids. Phosphate levels in the blood play an important role in hormone signaling and in bone homeostasis. In classical endocrine regulation, low serum phosphate induces the renal production of the seco-steroid hormone 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3). This active metabolite of vitamin D acts to restore circulating mineral (i.e. phosphate and calcium) levels by increasing absorption in the intestine, reabsorption in the kidney, and mobilization of calcium and phosphate from bone. Thus, chronic renal failure is associated with hyperparathyroidism, which in turn contributes to osteomalacia (softening of the bones). Another complication of chronic renal failure is hyperphosphatemia (low levels of phosphate in the blood). Hyperphosphatemia (excess levels of phosphate in the blood) is a prevalent condition in kidney dialysis patients and is associated with increased risk of mortality. Hypophosphatemia (hungry bone syndrome) has been associated to postoperative electrolyte aberrations and after parathyroidectomy (PMID: 17581921, 11169009, 11039261, 9159312, 17625581). Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) has recently been recognized as a key mediator of phosphate homeostasis, its most notable effect being promotion of phosphate excretion.

pmeth,544-31-0,147261,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): N-Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is present in the tissues of most mammals. It was initially described as an agonist of the type 2 cannabinoid receptor (CB2), although it is now universally recognized that PEA is in fact incapable of binding to cannabinoid receptors, or at least not to the known receptors. In addition to its anti-inflammatory activity, PEA also produces analgesia, neuroprotection, and possesses anti-epileptic properties. It also reduces gastrointestinal motility and cancer cell proliferation, as well as protecting the vascular endothelium in the ischemic heart. The physiological stimuli that regulate PEA levels in mammalian tissues are largely unknown, however, multiple studies indicate that this lipid accumulates during cellular stress, particularly following tissue injury. For example, PEA increases post-mortem in the pig brain. Similar elevations in PEA levels have been observed in the ischemic brain and PEA is also up-regulated in response to ultraviolet-B irradiation in mouse epidermal cells. Adipose tissue is highly implicated in the systemic secretion of IL-6 and leptin, and human mature adipocytes are able to secrete large quantity of PEA. Human adipose tissue can be subjected to modulation of its inflammatory state by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS strongly inhibits adipose cell leptin release, with PEA acting as a potentiator of this inhibitory effect. These actions are not linked to a reduction in leptin gene transcription. Thus, PEA does not have an anti-inflammatory role in the secretion of IL-6 via NFkappaB at the adipocyte level, but instead seems to act at the heart of the LPS-stimulated pathway, which, independently of NFkappaB, inhibits the secretion of leptin.

L-palmitoylcarnitine, due to its amphipatic character is, like detergents, a surface-active molecule and by changing the membrane fluidity and surface charge can change activity of several enzymes and transporters localized in the membrane. L-palmitoylcarnitine has been also reported to change the activity of certain proteins. On the contrary to carnitine, palmitoylcarnitine was shown to stimulate the activity of caspases 3, 7 and 8 and the level of this long-chain acylcarnitine increased during apoptosis. Palmitoylcarnitine was also reported to diminish completely binding of phorbol esters, the protein kinase C activators and to decrease the autophosphorylation of the enzyme. Apart from these isoform nonspecific phenomena, palmitoylcarnitine was also shown to be responsible for retardation in cytoplasm of protein kinase C isoforms &#946; and &#948; and, in the case of the latter one, to decrease its interaction with GAP-43. Some of the physico-chemical properties of palmitoylcarnitine may help to explain the need for coenzyme A-carnitine-coenzyme A acyl exchange during mitochondrial fatty acid import. The amphiphilic character of palmitoylcarnitine may also explain its proposed involvement in the pathogenesis of myocardial ischemia.

In propionic aciduria, propionyl CoA accumulates within the mitochondria in massive quantities; free carnitine is then esterified, creating propionyl carnitine, which is then excreted in the urine. Because the supply of carnitine in the diet and from synthesis is limited, such patients readily develop carnitine deficiency as a result of the increased loss of acylcarnitine derivatives.

ppi,14000-31-8,18361,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): The anion, the salts, and the esters of pyrophosphoric acid are called pyrophosphates. The pyrophosphate anion is abbreviated PPi and is formed by the hydrolysis of ATP into AMP in cells. This hydrolysis is called pyrophosphorolysis. The pyrophosphate anion has the structure P2O74-, and is an acid anhydride of phosphate. It is unstable in aqueous solution and rapidly hydrolyzes into inorganic phosphate. Pyrophosphate is an osteotoxin (arrests bone development) and an arthritogen (promotes arthritis). It is also a metabotoxin (an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health affects at chronically high levels). Chronically high levels of pyrophosphate are associated with hypophosphatasia. Hypophosphatasia (also called deficiency of alkaline phosphatase or phosphoethanolaminuria) is a rare, and sometimes fatal, metabolic bone disease. Hypophosphatasia is associated with a molecular defect in the gene encoding tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP). TNSALP is an enzyme that is tethered to the outer surface of osteoblasts and chondrocytes. TNSALP hydrolyzes several substances, including inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), a major form of vitamin B6. When TSNALP is low, inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) accumulates outside of cells and inhibits the formation of hydroxyapatite, one of the main components of bone, causing rickets in infants and children and osteomalacia (soft bones) in adults. Vitamin B6 must be dephosphorylated by TNSALP before it can cross the cell membrane. Vitamin B6 deficiency in the brain impairs synthesis of neurotransmitters which can cause seizures.

ppp9,553-12-8,15430,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Protoporphyrins are tetrapyrroles containing 4 methyl, 2 propionic, and 2 vinyl side chains. Protoporphyrin is produced by oxidation of the methylene bridge of protoporphyrinogen. Protoporphyrin IX is the only naturally occurring isomer; it is an intermediate in heme biosynthesis, combining with ferrous iron to form protoheme IX, the heme prosthetic group of hemoglobin. Protoporphyrin IX is created by the enzyme protoporphyrinogen oxidase. The enzyme ferrochelatase converts it into heme. Protoporphyrin IX naturally occurs in small amounts in feces. Protoporphyrin IX is also responsible for the brown pigment (ooporphyrin) of birds' eggs. Protoporphyrin IX is used as a branch point in the biosynthetic pathway leading to heme (by insertion of iron) and chlorophylls (by insertion of Mg and further side-chain transformation). Protoporphyrin IX can be used to treat liver disorders, mainly as the sodium salt. Under certain conditions, protoporphyrin IX can act as a neurotoxin, a phototoxin, and a metabotoxin. A neurotoxin causes damage to nerve cells and nerve tissues. A phototoxin causes cell damage upon exposure to light. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of porphyrins are associated with porphyrias such as porphyria variegate, acute intermittent porphyria, and hereditary coproporphyria (HCP). In particular, it is accumulated and excreted excessively in the feces in acute intermittent porphyria, protoporphyria, and variegate porphyria. There are several types of porphyrias (most are inherited).

Pregnenolone is the precursor to gonadal steroid hormones and the adrenal corticosteroids. This reaction occurs in steroid hormone-producing tissues such as the adrenal cortex, corpus luteum and placenta. The most notable difference between the placenta and other steroidogenic tissues is that electron supply to CYP11A1 limits the rate at which cholesterol is converted to pregnenolone in the placenta. The limiting component for electron delivery to CYP11A1 is the concentration of adrenodoxin reductase in the mitochondrial matrix which is insufficient to maintain the adrenodoxin pool in a fully reduced state. Pregnenolone is also a neurosteroid, and is produced in the spinal cord; CYP11A1 is the key enzyme catalyzing the conversion of cholesterol into pregnenolone, the rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of all classes of steroids, and has been localized in sensory networks of the spinal cord dorsal horn. In the adrenal glomerulosa cell angiotensin II, one of the major physiological regulators of mineralocorticoid synthesis, appears to affect most of the cholesterol transfer to the mitochondrial outer membrane and transport to the inner membrane steps and thus to exerts a powerful control over the use of cholesterol for aldosterone production.

Progesterone acts on the uterus, the mammary glands and the brain. It is required in embryo implantation, pregnancy maintenance, and the development of mammary tissue for milk production. Progesterone, converted from pregnenolone, also serves as an intermediate in the biosynthesis of gonadal steroid hormones and adrenal corticosteroids (Pubchem). Progesterone is a C-21 steroid hormone involved in the female menstrual cycle, pregnancy (supports gestation) and embryogenesis of humans and other species. Progesterone belongs to a class of hormones called progestagens, and is the major naturally occurring human progestagen (Wikipedia). During implantation and gestation, progesterone appears to decrease the maternal immune response to allow for the acceptance of the pregnancy. Progesterone decreases contractility of the uterine smooth muscle. The fetus metabolizes placental progesterone in the production of adrenal mineralo- and glucosteroids. A drop in progesterone levels is possibly one step that facilitates the onset of labor. In addition progesterone inhibits lactation during pregnancy. The fall in progesterone levels following delivery is one of the triggers for milk production (Wikipedia).

It is also found in the lipids from many sources such as freshwater sponges, krill, earthworms, whales, human milk fat, bovine depot fat, butterfat or Californian petroleum. It is usually present in combination with phytanic acid. In humans, pristanic acid is obtained from two sources: either directly from the diet or as the alpha oxidation product of phytanic acid. At physiological concentrations pristanic acid is a natural ligand for PPARalpha. In liver, pristanic acid is degraded by peroxisomal beta oxidation to propionyl-CoA. Together with phytanic acid, pristanic acid accumulates in several inherited disorders such as Zellweger syndrome. Pristanic acid is a branched chain fatty acid that arises from the breakdown of phytanic acid. It is present at micromolar concentrations in the plasma of healthy individuals. Pristanic acid is normally degraded by peroxisomal beta-oxidation. In patients affected with generalized peroxisomal disorders, degradation of both phytanic acid and pristanic acid is impaired owing to absence of functional peroxisomes.

pro_L,147-85-3,17203,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): L-proline is one of the twenty amino acids used in living organisms as the building blocks of proteins. Proline is sometimes called an imino acid, although the IUPAC definition of an imine requires a carbon-nitrogen double bond. Proline is a non-essential amino acid that is synthesized from glutamic acid. It is an essential component of collagen and is important for proper functioning of joints and tendons. Proline is derived from the amino acid L-glutamate in which glutamate-5-semialdehyde is first formed by glutamate 5-kinase and glutamate-5-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (which requires NADH or NADPH). This semialdehyde can then either spontaneously cyclize to form 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylic acid, which is reduced to proline by pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase, or turned into ornithine by ornithine aminotransferase, followed by cyclization by ornithine cyclodeaminase to form proline. L-Proline has been found to act as a weak agonist of the glycine receptor and of both NMDA and non-NMDA ionotropic glutamate receptors. It has been proposed to be a potential endogenous excitotoxin/neurotoxin. Studies in rats have shown that when injected into the brain, proline non-selectively destroys pyramidal and granule cells (PMID: 3409032). Therefore, under certain conditions proline can act as a neurotoxin and a metabotoxin. A neurotoxin causes damage to nerve cells and nerve tissues. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of proline are associated with at least five inborn errors of metabolism, including hyperprolinemia type I, hyperprolinemia type II, iminoglycinuria, prolinemia type II, and pyruvate carboxylase deficiency. People with hyperprolinemia type I often do not show any symptoms even though they have proline levels in their blood between 3 and 10 times the normal level. Some individuals with hyperprolinemia type I exhibit seizures, intellectual disability, or other neurological or psychiatric problems. Hyperprolinemia type II results in proline levels in the blood between 10 and 15 times higher than normal, and high levels of a related compound called pyrroline-5-carboxylate. Hyperprolinemia type II has signs and symptoms that vary in severity, and is more likely than type I to involve seizures or intellectual disability.",L-Proline,HMDB0000162,,,C00148,PRO,FDB000570,pro_L,[H]C1([H])C([H])([H])[N+]([H])([H])[C@]([H])(C([O-])=O)C1([H])[H],(-)-(S)-Proline***(-)-2-Pyrrolidinecarboxylic acid***(-)-Proline***(2S)-Pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid***(S)-2-Carboxypyrrolidine***(S)-2-Pyrrolidinecarboxylic acid***(S)-Pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid***2-Pyrrolidinecarboxylic acid***L-(-)-Proline***L-alpha-Pyrrolidinecarboxylic acid***L-Prolin***L-Pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid***P***Prolina***PROLINE***Prolinum***(-)-2-Pyrrolidinecarboxylate***(2S)-Pyrrolidine-2-carboxylate***(S)-2-Pyrrolidinecarboxylate***(S)-Pyrrolidine-2-carboxylate***2-Pyrrolidinecarboxylate***L-a-Pyrrolidinecarboxylate***L-a-Pyrrolidinecarboxylic acid***L-alpha-Pyrrolidinecarboxylate***L-α-pyrrolidinecarboxylate***L-α-pyrrolidinecarboxylic acid***L-Pyrrolidine-2-carboxylate***(S)-(-)-Proline***(S)-(-)-Pyrrolidine-2-carboxylate***(S)-(-)-Pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid***(S)-2-Pyrralidinecarboxylate***(S)-2-Pyrralidinecarboxylic acid***(S)-Proline***L Proline,ONIBWKKTOPOVIA-BYPYZUCNSA-N,"InChI=1S/C5H9NO2/c7-5(8)4-2-1-3-6-4/h4,6H,1-3H2,(H,7,8)/t4-/m0/s1"

prostgd2,41598-07-6,15555,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Prostaglandin D2 (or PGD2) is a prostaglandin that is actively produced in various organs such as the brain, spleen, thymus, bone marrow, uterus, ovary, oviduct, testis, prostate and epididymis, and is involved in many physiological events. PGD2 binds to the prostaglandin D2 receptor (PTGDR) which is a G-protein-coupled receptor. Its activity is mainly mediated by G-S proteins that stimulate adenylate cyclase resulting in an elevation of intracellular cAMP and Ca2+. PGD2 promotes sleep; regulates body temperature, olfactory function, hormone release, and nociception in the central nervous system; prevents platelet aggregation; and induces vasodilation and bronchoconstriction. PGD2 is also released from mast cells as an allergic and inflammatory mediator. Prostaglandin H2 is an unstable intermediate formed from PGG2 by the action of cyclooxygenase (COX) in the arachidonate cascade. In mammalian systems, it is efficiently converted into more stable arachidonate metabolites, such as PGD2, PGE2, PGF2a by the action of three groups of enzymes, PGD synthases (PGDS), PGE synthases and PGF synthases, respectively. PGDS catalyzes the isomerization of PGH2 to PGD2. Two types of PGD2 synthase are known. Lipocalin-type PGD synthase is present in cerebrospinal fluid, seminal plasma and may play an important role in male reproduction. Another PGD synthase, hematopoietic PGD synthase is present in the spleen, fallopian tube, endometrial gland cells, extravillous trophoblasts and villous trophoblasts, and perhaps plays an important role in female reproduction. Recent studies demonstrate that PGD2 is probably involved in multiple aspects of inflammation through its dual receptor systems, DP and CRTH2. (PMID: 12148545)Prostaglandins are eicosanoids.

It inhibits platelet aggregation and has many other biological effects such as bronchodilation, mediation of inflammation, and various protective functions.The protective action of PGE1 has been shown on both experimental animal models of liver injury and patients with fulminant viral hepatitis. PGE1-treated cirrhotic rats had less hepatosplenomegaly, lower serum alanine aminotransferase levels, and portal pressures and higher arterial pressure than placebo-treated cirrhotic rats. Mechanisms of hepatic cytopotection of PGE1: inhibitory effects on T-cell mediated cytotoxicity, enhance DNA synthesis of injured liver after partial hepatectomy by stimulating cyclic AMP production and increasing ATP level in hepatic tissue, and could accelerate the recovery of mitochondrial respiratory functio n after reperfusion, stabilization of membrane microviscosity.PGE1 is a prostanoid.

It has important effects in labour and also stimulates osteoblasts to release factors which stimulate bone resorption by osteoclasts (a type of bone cell that removes bone tissue by removing the bone's mineralized matrix). PGE2 is also the prostaglandin that ultimately induces fever. PGE2 has been shown to increase vasodilation and cAMP production, to enhance the effects of bradykinin and histamine, induction of uterine contractions and of platelet aggregation. PGE2 is also responsible for maintaining the open passageway of the fetal ductus arteriosus; decreasing T-cell proliferation and lymphocyte migration and activating the secretion of IL-1&#945; and IL-2. PGE2 exhibits both pro- and anti-inflammatory effects, particularly on dendritic cells (DC). Depending on the nature of maturation signals, PGE2 has different and sometimes opposite effects on DC biology. PGE2 exerts an inhibitory action, reducing the maturation of DC and their ability to present antigen. PGE2 has also been shown to stimulate DC and promote IL-12 production when given in combination with TNF-alpha. PGE2 is an environmentally bioactive substance. Its action is prolonged and sustained by other factors especially IL-10. It modulates the activities of professional DC by acting on their differentiation, maturation and their ability to secrete cytokines.

prostgf2,551-11-1,15553,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Prostaglandin F2a (PGF2) is one of the earliest discovered and most common prostaglandins. It is actively biosynthesized in various organs of mammals and exhibits a variety of biological activities, including contraction of pulmonary arteries. It is used in medicine to induce labor and as an abortifacient. PGF2a binds to the Prostaglandin F2 receptor (PTGFR) which is a member of the G-protein coupled receptor family. PGF2-alpha mediates luteolysis. Luteolysis is the structural and functional degradation of the corpus luteum (CL) that occurs at the end of the luteal phase of both the estrous and menstrual cycles in the absence of pregnancy. PGF2 may also be involved in modulating intraocular pressure and smooth muscle contraction in the uterus and gastrointestinal tract sphincters. PGF2 is mainly synthesized directly from PGH2 by PGH2 9,11-endoperoxide reductase. A small amount of PGF2 is also produced from PGE2 by PGE2 9-ketoreductase. A PGF2 epimer has been reported to exhibit various biological activities, and its levels are increased in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, plasma, and urine in patients with mastocytosis and bronchial asthma. PGF2 is synthesized from PGD2 by PGD2 11-ketoreductase. (PMID: 16475787). Prostaglandins are eicosanoids.

prostgh2,42935-17-1,15554,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) is the first intermediate in the biosynthesis of all prostaglandins. Prostaglandins are synthesized from arachidonic acid by the enzyme COX-1 and COX-2, which are also called PGH synthase 1 and 2. These enzymes generate a reactive intermediate PGH2 which has a reasonably long half-life (90-100 s) but is highly lipophilic. PGH2 is converted into the biologically active prostaglandins by prostaglandin isomerases, yielding PGE2, PGD2, and PGF2, or by thromboxane synthase to make TxA2 or by prostacyclin synthase to make PGI2. Most nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin and indomethacin inhibit both PGH synthase 1 and 2. A key feature for eicosanoid transcellular biosynthesis is the export of PGH2 or LTA4 from the donor cell as well as the uptake of these reactive intermediates by the acceptor cell. Very little is known about either process despite the demonstrated importance of both events. In cells, PGH2 rearranges nonenzymatically to LGs even in the presence of enzymes that use PGH2 as a substrate. When platelets form Thromboxane A2 (TXA2) from endogenous arachidonic acid (AA), PGH2 reaches concentrations very similar to those of TXA2 and high enough to produce strong platelet activation. Therefore, platelet activation by TXA2 appears to go along with an activation by PGH2. The agonism of PGH2 is limited by the formation of inhibitory prostaglandins, especially PGD2 at higher concentrations. That is why thromboxane synthase inhibitors in PRP and at a physiological HSA concentration do not augment platelet activation. (PMID: 2798452, 15650407, 16968946)Prostaglandins are eicosanoids.

prostgi2,35121-78-9,15552,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Prostaglandin I2 or prostacyclin (or PGI2) is a member of the family of lipid molecules known as eicosanoids. It is produced in endothelial cells from prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) by the action of the enzyme prostacyclin synthase. It is a powerful vasodilator and inhibits platelet aggregation. Prostaglandin I2 is the main prostaglandin synthesized by the blood vessel wall. This suggests that it may play an important role in limiting platelet-mediated thrombosis. In particular, prostacyclin (PGI2) chiefly prevents formation of the platelet plug involved in primary hemostasis (a part of blood clot formation). The sodium salt (known as epoprostenol) has been used to treat primary pulmonary hypertension. Prostacyclin (PGI2) is released by healthy endothelial cells and performs its function through a paracrine signaling cascade that involves G protein-coupled receptors on nearby platelets and endothelial cells. The platelet Gs protein-coupled receptor (prostacyclin receptor) is activated when it binds to PGI2. This activation, in turn, signals adenylyl cyclase to produce cAMP. cAMP goes on to inhibit any undue platelet activation (in order to promote circulation) and also counteracts any increase in cytosolic calcium levels which would result from thromboxane A2 (TXA2) binding (leading to platelet activation and subsequent coagulation). PGI2 also binds to endothelial prostacyclin receptors and in the same manner raise cAMP levels in the cytosol. This cAMP then goes on to activate protein kinase A (PKA). PKA then continues the cascade by inhibiting myosin light-chain kinase which leads to smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation. Notably, PGI2 and TXA2 work as antagonists. PGI2 is stable in basic buffers (pH=8), but it is rapidly hydrolyzed to 6-keto PGF1alpha in neutral or acidic solutions. The half-life is short both in vivo and in vitro, ranging from 30 seconds to a few minutes. PGI2 is administered by continuous infusion in humans for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary hypertension.Prostaglandins are eicosanoids. The eicosanoids consist of the prostaglandins (PGs), thromboxanes (TXs), leukotrienes (LTs) and lipoxins (LXs). The PGs and TXs are collectively identified as prostanoids.

protochloroph,,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Protochlorophyllide is found in fruits. Protochlorophyllide is isolated from the seed husks of Cucurbita pepo Chlorophyll itself is bound to proteins and can transfer the absorbed energy in the required direction. Protochlorophyllide, differently, mostly occurs in the free form and under light conditions acts as photosensitizer, forming highly toxic free radicals. Hence plants need an efficient mechanism of regulating the amount of chlorophyll precursor. In angiosperms, this is done at the step of D-Aminolevulinic acid (ALA), one of the intermediate compounds in the biosynthesis pathway. Plants that are fed by ALA accumulate high and toxic levels of protochlorophyllide, so do the mutants with the damaged regulatory system. Despite of numerous past attempts to find the mutant that overacumulates protochlorophyllide under usual conditions, only one such gene (flu) is currently (2009) known. Flu (first described in ) is a nuclear - encoded, chloroplast - located protein that appears containing only protein - protein interaction sites. It is currently not know which other proteins interact through this linker. The regulatory protein is a transmembrane protein that is located in the thylakoid membrane. Later it was discovered that Tigrina mutants in barley, known long time ago, are also mutated in the same gene It is not obvious why no mutants of any other gene were observed; maybe mutations in other proteins, involved into the regulatory chain, are fatal. Flu is a single gene, not a member of the gene family. Protochlorophyllide , more accurate monovinyl protochlorophyllide, is an immediate precursor of chlorophyll a that lacks the phytol side chain of chlorophyll. Unlike chlorophyll, protochlorophyllide is highly fluorescent; mutants that accumulate it glow in red if irradiated by the blue lightIn Angiosperms, the last step, conversion of protochlorophyllide to chlorophyll, is light - dependent and such plants are pale (etiolated) if grown in the darkness. Gymnosperms, algae, and photosynthetic bacteria additionally have another, light - independent enzyme and grow green in the darkness as well. The enzyme that converts protochlorophyllide to chlorophyll is protochlorophyllide reductase , EC 1.3.1.33. There are two structurally unrelated proteins with this activity: the light - dependent and the dark - operative. The light dependent reductase needs light to operate. The dark - operative version is a completely different protein, consisting of three subunits that exhibit significant sequence similarity to the three subunits of nitrogenase, which catalyzes the formation of ammonia from dinitrogen. This enzyme might be evolutionary older but (being similar to nitrogenase) is highly sensitive to free oxygen and does not work if its concentration exceeds about 3 %. Hence the alternative, light dependent version needed to evolve",Protochlorophyllide,HMDB0031148,,,,,,,,,,

ptrc,110-60-1,17148,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Putrescine is a polyamine. Putrescine is related to cadaverine (another polyamine). Both are produced by the breakdown of amino acids in living and dead organisms and both are toxic in large doses. Putrescine and cadaverine are largely responsible for the foul odor of putrefying flesh, but also contribute to the odor of such processes as bad breath and bacterial vaginosis. Putrescine is also found in semen. Putrescine attacks s-adenosyl methionine and converts it to spermidine. Spermidine in turn attacks another s-adenosyl methionine and converts it to spermine. Putrescine is synthesized in small quantities by healthy living cells by the action of ornithine decarboxylase. The polyamines, of which putrescine is one of the simplest, appear to be growth factors necessary for cell division. Putrescine apparently has specific role in skin physiology and neuroprotection. (PMID: 15009201, 16364196). Pharmacological interventions have demonstrated convincingly that a steady supply of polyamines is a prerequisite for cell proliferation to occur. Genetic engineering of polyamine metabolism in transgenic rodents has shown that polyamines play a role in spermatogenesis, skin physiology, promotion of tumorigenesis and organ hypertrophy as well as neuronal protection. Transgenic activation of polyamine catabolism not only profoundly disturbs polyamine homeostasis in most tissues, but also creates a complex phenotype affecting skin, female fertility, fat depots, pancreatic integrity and regenerative growth. Transgenic expression of ornithine decarboxylase antizyme has suggested that this unique protein may act as a general tumor suppressor.

Pitavastatin appears to be a substrate of CYP2C9, and not CYP3A4 (which is a common source of interactions in other statins). As a result, pitavastatin is less likely to interact with drugs that are metabolized via CYP3A4, which might be important for elderly patients who need to take multiple medicines. Pitavastatin (usually as a calcium salt) is a member of the medication class of statins, marketed in the United States under the trade name Livalo.

Later it was shown that vitamin B6 could exist in two other, slightly different, chemical forms, termed pyridoxal and pyridoxamine. All three forms of vitamin B6 are precursors of an activated compound known as pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP), which plays a vital role as the cofactor of a large number of essential enzymes in the human body.

q8h2,,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Ubiquinol 8 is a ubiquinol in which the polyprenyl substituent is octaprenyl. Ubiquinol-8 is the reduced form of ubiquinone-8. Ubiquinone (also known as coenzyme Q) is an isoprenoid quinone that functions as an electron carrier in membranes. In eukaryotes, ubiquinone is found mostly within the inner mitochondrial membrane where it functions in respiratory electron transport, transferring two electrons from either complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) or complex II (succinate-ubiquinone reductase) to complex III (bc1 complex). The quinone nucleus of ubiquinone is derived directly from 4-hydroxybenzoate, while the isoprenoid subunits of the polyisoprenoid tail are synthesized via the methylerythritol phosphate pathway, which feeds isoprene units into the polyprenyl biosynthesis pathways. The number of isoprenoid subunits in the ubiquinone side chain varies in different species. For example, Saccharomyces cerevisiae has 6 such subunits, Escherichia coli K-12 has 8, rat and mouse have 9, and Homo sapiens has 10. Ubiquinol-8 is effective as an anti-oxidant. By donating one of its hydrogen atoms to become the free-radical semiquinone (.Q-), it can neutralize a lipid peroxyl radical. The free-radical semiquinone is then restored to a non-free-radical state by the respiratory chain Q cycle. Ubiquinol or the free-radical semiquinone can also regenerate the Vitamin E tocopheroxyl radical by electron donation (http://www.benbest.com/nutrceut/CoEnzymeQ.html).",Ubiquinol-8,HMDB0001060,,,,,,,,,,

Ribose 1-phosphate can be formed from guanosine through the action of purine nucleoside phosphorylase. Ribose 1-phosphate can also act as a ribose donor in the synthesis of xanthosine as catalyzed by the same enzyme (purine nucleoside phosphorylase). The presence of guanase, which irreversibly converts guanine to xanthine, affects the overall process of guanosine transformation. As a result of this purine pathway, guanosine is converted into xanthosine, thus overcoming the lack of guanosine deaminase in mammals.

rib_D,50-69-1,16988,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): D-ribose is commonly referred to simply as ribose, a five-carbon sugar found in all living cells. Ribose is not an essential nutrient because it can be synthesized by almost every tissue in the body from other substances, such as glucose. It is vital for life as a component of DNA, RNA, ATP, ADP, and AMP. In nature, small amounts of ribose can be found in ripe fruits and vegetables. Brewer's yeast, which has a high concentration of RNA, is another rich source of ribose. D-ribose is also a component of many so-called energy drinks and antiaging products available on the market today. Ribose is a structural component of ATP, which is the primary energy source for exercising muscle. The adenosine component is an adenine base attached to the five-carbon sugar ribose. ATP provides energy to working muscles by releasing a phosphate group, hence becoming ADP, which in turn may release a phosphate group, then becoming AMP. During intense muscular activity, the total amount of ATP available is quickly depleted. In an effort to correct this imbalance, AMP is broken down in the muscle and secreted from the cell. Once the breakdown products of AMP are released from the cell, the energy potential (TAN pool) of the muscle is reduced and ATP must then be reformed using ribose. Ribose helps restore the level of adenine nucleotides by bypassing the rate-limiting step in the de novo (oxidative pentose phosphate) pathway, which regenerates 5-phosphoribosyl-l-pyrophosphate (PRPP), the essential precursor for ATP. If ribose is not readily available to a cell, glucose may be converted to ribose. Ribose supplementation has been shown to increase the rate of ATP resynthesis following intense exercise. The use of ribose in men with severe coronary artery disease resulted in improved exercise tolerance. Hence, there is interest in the potential of ribose supplements to boost muscular performance in athletic activities (PMID: 17618002, Curr Sports Med Rep. 2007 Jul;6(4):254-7.).

Nicotinamide riboside has recently been discovered to be an NAD(+) precursor that is converted to nicotinamide mononucleotide by specific nicotinamide riboside kinases, Nrk1 and Nrk2. It has been shown that exogenous nicotinamide riboside promotes Sir2-dependent repression of recombination, improves gene silencing, and extends the lifespan of certain animal models without calorie restriction [PMID:17482543]. Supplementation in mammalian cells and mouse tissues increases NAD(+) levels and activates SIRT1 and SIRT3, culminating in enhanced oxidative metabolism and protection against high-fat diet-induced metabolic abnormalities. (PMID:22682224). Recent data suggest that nicotinamide riboside may be the only vitamin precursor that supports neuronal NAD+ synthesis (PMID: 18429699).

s,,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): A sulfide or sulphide (UK) is an anion of sulfur in its lowest oxidation state of 2-. Sulfide is also a slightly archaic term for thioethers, a common type oforganosulfur compound that are well known for their bad odors. Sulfides are moderately strong reducing agents. They react with oxygen in the air in elevated temperatures to form higher-valence sulfur salts, such as sulfates and sulfur dioxide. (Wikipedia). Sulfur (Greek is theion) is the chemical element in the periodic table that has the symbol S and atomic number 16. It is an abundant, tasteless, odorless, multivalent non-metal. Sulfur, in its native form, is a yellow crystalline solid. In nature, it can be found as the pure element or as sulfide and sulfate minerals. It is an essential element for life, and is widely used in biochemical processes. Sulfur is an important part of many enzymes and also in antioxidant molecules like glutathione and thioredoxin. The amino acids cysteine and methionine contain sulfur, as do all polypeptides, proteins, and enzymes which contain these amino acids. This makes sulfur a necessary component of all living cells. Disulfide bonds between polypeptides are very important in protein assembly and structure. They are largely responsible for the mechanical strength and insolubility of the protein keratin, found in outer skin, hair, and feathers, and the element contributes to their pungent odor when burned. (Wikipedia). Homocysteine and taurine are also sulfur containing amino acids but are not coded for by DNA nor are they part of the primary structure of proteins. Some forms of bacteria use hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in the place of water as the electron donor in a primitive photosynthesis-like process. Sulfur is absorbed by plants via the roots from soil as the sulfate ion and reduced to sulfide before it is incorporated into cysteine and other organic sulfur compounds (sulfur assimilation). Inorganic sulfur forms a part of iron-sulfur clusters, and sulfur is the bridging ligand in the CuA site of cytochrome c oxidase. Sulfur is an important component of coenzyme A. At room temperature, sulfur is a soft bright yellow solid. Although sulfur is blamed for the smell of rotten eggs elemental sulfur has only the faintest odor (the odor associated with rotten eggs is actually due to hydrogen sulfide and organic sulfur compounds). It burns with a blue flame that emits sulfur dioxide, notable for its peculiar suffocating odor. Sulfur is insoluble in water but soluble in carbon disulfide and to a lesser extent in other organic solvents such as benzene. Through its major derivative, sulfuric acid (H2SO4), sulfur ranks as one of the more important industrial raw materials. It is of prime importance to every sector of the world's economies. The Latin name of the element is sulfur with an F. Since it is an original Latin name and not a Classical Greek loan, the fricative phoneme is indeed denoted with f rather than ph. Its commercial uses are primarily in fertilizers, but it is also widely used in gunpowder, matches, insecticides and fungicides; A flammable, poisonous gas with a characteristic odor of rotten eggs. It is used in the manufacture of chemicals, in metallurgy, and as an analytical reagent. (From Merck Index, 11th ed.) The burning of coal and petroleum by industry and power plants liberates huge amounts of sulfur dioxide (SO2) which reacts with atmospheric water and oxygen to produce sulfuric acid. This sulfuric acid is a component of acid rain, which lowers the pH of soil and freshwater bodies, resulting in substantial damage to the natural environment and chemical weathering of statues and architecture.",Sulfur,HMDB0000598,,,,,,,,,,

saccrp_L,997-68-2,16927,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Saccharopine is an intermediate in the degradation of lysine, formed by the condensation of lysine and alpha-ketoglutarate. The saccharopine pathway is the main route for lysine degradation in mammals, and its first two reactions are catalyzed by enzymatic activities known as lysine-oxoglutarate reductase (LOR) and saccharopine dehydrogenase (SDH), which reside on a single bifunctional polypeptide (LOR/SDH) (EC 1.5.1.8). The reactions involved with saccharopine dehydrogenases have very strict substrate specificity for L-lysine, 2-oxoglutarate, and NADPH. LOR/SDH has been detected in a number of mammalian tissues, mainly in the liver and kidney, contributing not only to the general nitrogen balance in the organism but also to the controlled conversion of lysine into ketone bodies. A tetrameric form has also been observed in human liver and placenta. LOR activity has also been detected in brain mitochondria during embryonic development, and this opens up the question of whether or not lysine degradation has any functional significance during brain development. As a result, there is now a new focus on the nutritional requirements for lysine in gestation and infancy. Finally, LOR and/or SDH deficiencies seem to be involved in a human autosomal genetic disorder known as familial hyperlysinemia, which is characterized by serious defects in the functioning of the nervous system and characterized by a deficiency in lysine-ketoglutarate reductase, saccharopine dehydrogenase, and saccharopine oxidoreductase activities. Saccharopinuria (high amounts of saccharopine in the urine) and saccharopinemia (an excess of saccharopine in the blood) are conditions present in some inherited disorders of lysine degradation (PMID: 463877, 10567240, 10772957, 4809305). If present in sufficiently high levels, saccharopine can act as an acidogen and a metabotoxin. An acidogen is an acidic compound that induces acidosis, which has multiple adverse effects on many organ systems. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Saccharopine is an organic acid. Abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). Many affected children with organic acidemias experience intellectual disability or delayed development.",Saccharopine,HMDB0000279,,,C00449,SACCHAROPINE,FDB000461,saccrp_L,[H][N+]([H])([H])[C@]([H])(C([O-])=O)C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])[N+]([H])([H])[C@]([H])(C([O-])=O)C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([O-])=O,"epsilon-N-(L-Glutar-2-yl)-L-lysine***N-[(S)-5-amino-5-Carboxypentyl]-L-glutamic acid***N6-(L-1,3-Dicarboxypropyl)-L-lysine***N-[(S)-5-amino-5-Carboxypentyl]-L-glutamate***(S)-N-(5-amino-5-Carboxypentyl)-L-glutamic acid***L-N-(5-amino-5-Carboxypentyl)-glutamic acid***L-Saccharopin***L-Saccharopine***N(6)-(L-1,3-Dicarboxypropyl)-L-lysine***N-(5-amino-5-Carboxypentyl)-glutamic acid***N-(5-amino-5-Carboxypentyl)-L-glutamic acid***N-[(5S)-5-amino-5-Carboxypentyl]-L-glutamic acid***Saccharopin",ZDGJAHTZVHVLOT-YUMQZZPRSA-M,"InChI=1S/C11H20N2O6/c12-7(10(16)17)3-1-2-6-13-8(11(18)19)4-5-9(14)15/h7-8,13H,1-6,12H2,(H,14,15)(H,16,17)(H,18,19)/p-1/t7-,8-/m0/s1"

Selenomethionine is the major seleno-compound in cereal grains (wheat grain, maize and rice), soybeans and enriched yeast. Seleno-compounds present in plants may have a profound effect upon the health of animals and human subjects. It is now known that the total Se content cannot be used as an indication of its efficacy, but knowledge of individual selenocompounds is necessary to fully assess the significance. Thus, speciation of the seleno-compounds has moved to the forefront. Since animals and man are dependent upon plants for their nutritional requirements, this makes the types of seleno-compounds in plants even more critical. Se enters the food chain through incorporation into plant proteins, mostly as selenocysteine and selenomethionine at normal Se levels. There are two possible pathways for the catabolism of selenomethionine. One is the transsulfuration pathway via selenocystathionine to produce selenocysteine, which in turn is degraded to H2Se by the enzyme b-lyase. The other pathway is the transamination-decarboxylation pathway. It was estimated that 90% of methionine is metabolized through this pathway and thus could be also the major route for selenomethionine catabolism.

D-serine is synthesized from L-serine by serine racemase (SRR), and it is degraded by D-amino acid oxidase (DAO). It is found in high abundance in the brain. D-serine acts on the glycine binding site of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and modulates glutamate-mediated receptor activation. For the receptor to open, glutamate and either glycine or D-serine must bind to it. In fact, D-serine is a more potent agonist at the glycine site on the NMDAR than glycine itself. The importance of D-serine in mammalian brain function is apparent from extensive investigations reported and reviewed over the past decade, including roles in synaptic plasticity and memory. D-serine is also implicated in the pathophysiology and therapy of several psychiatric and neurological conditions including schizophrenia and glioma. In schizophrenia, there is evidence that D-serine levels are decreased, a deficiency that may contribute to the proposed NMDAR hypofunction of the disorder and that has led to D-serine replenishment as a novel therapeutic strategy.",D-Serine,HMDB0003406,,,C00740,Serines,FDB023164,ser_D,[H]OC([H])([H])[C@]([H])(C([O-])=O)[N+]([H])([H])[H],(2R)-2-amino-3-Hydroxypropanoic acid***(R)-2-amino-3-Hydroxy-propionic acid***(R)-2-amino-3-Hydroxypropanoic acid***D-Serin***DSN***(2R)-2-amino-3-Hydroxypropanoate***(R)-2-amino-3-Hydroxy-propionate***(R)-2-amino-3-Hydroxypropanoate***DL-Serine***Serine D-form,MTCFGRXMJLQNBG-UWTATZPHSA-N,"InChI=1S/C3H7NO3/c4-2(1-5)3(6)7/h2,5H,1,4H2,(H,6,7)/t2-/m1/s1"

ser_L,56-45-1,17115,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Serine is a nonessential amino acid derived from glycine. Like all the amino acid building blocks of protein and peptides, serine can become essential under certain conditions, and is thus important in maintaining health and preventing disease. Low-average concentration of serine compared to other amino acids is found in muscle. Serine is highly concentrated in all cell membranes. (http://www.dcnutrition.com/AminoAcids/) L-Serine may be derived from four possible sources: dietary intake; biosynthesis from the glycolytic intermediate 3-phosphoglycerate; from glycine ; and by protein and phospholipid degradation. Little data is available on the relative contributions of each of these four sources of l-serine to serine homoeostasis. It is very likely that the predominant source of l-serine will be very different in different tissues and during different stages of human development. In the biosynthetic pathway, the glycolytic intermediate 3-phosphoglycerate is converted into phosphohydroxypyruvate, in a reaction catalyzed by 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (3- PGDH; EC 1.1.1.95). Phosphohydroxypyruvate is metabolized to phosphoserine by phosphohydroxypyruvate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.52) and, finally, phosphoserine is converted into l-serine by phosphoserine phosphatase (PSP; EC 3.1.3.3). In liver tissue, the serine biosynthetic pathway is regulated in response to dietary and hormonal changes. Of the three synthetic enzymes, the properties of 3-PGDH and PSP are the best documented. Hormonal factors such as glucagon and corticosteroids also influence 3-PGDH and PSP activities in interactions dependent upon the diet. L-serine plays a central role in cellular proliferation. L-Serine is the predominant source of one-carbon groups for the de novo synthesis of purine nucleotides and deoxythymidine monophosphate. It has long been recognized that, in cell cultures, L-serine is a conditional essential amino acid, because it cannot be synthesized in sufficient quantities to meet the cellular demands for its utilization. In recent years, L-serine and the products of its metabolism have been recognized not only to be essential for cell proliferation, but also to be necessary for specific functions in the central nervous system. The findings of altered levels of serine and glycine in patients with psychiatric disorders and the severe neurological abnormalities in patients with defects of L-serine synthesis underscore the importance of L-serine in brain development and function.

so3,14265-45-3,17359,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Endogenous sulfite is generated as a consequence of the body's normal processing of sulfur-containing amino acids. Sulfites occur as a consequence of fermentation and also occur naturally in a number of foods and beverages. As food additives, sulfiting agents were first used in 1664 and have been approved in the United States since the 1800s. Sulfite is an allergen, a neurotoxin, and a metabotoxin.  An allergen is a compound that causes allergic reactions such as wheezing, rash, or rhinitis. A neurotoxin is a substance that causes damage to nerves or brain tissues. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. As an allergen, sulfite is known to induce asthmatic reactions. Sulfite sensitivity occurs most often in asthmatic adults (predominantly women), but it is also occasionally reported in preschool children. Adverse reactions to sulfites in nonasthmatics are extremely rare. Asthmatics who are steroid-dependent or who have a higher degree of airway hyperreactivity may be at greater risk of experiencing a reaction to sulfite-containing foods. Sulfite sensitivity reactions vary widely, ranging from no reaction to severe. The majority of reactions are mild. These manifestations may include dermatologic, respiratory, or gastrointestinal signs and symptoms. The precise mechanisms of the sensitivity responses have not been completely elucidated: inhalation of sulfur dioxide (SO2) generated in the stomach following ingestion of sulfite-containing foods or beverages, a deficiency in a mitochondrial enzyme, and an IgE-mediated immune response have all been implicated. Exogenously supplied sulfite is detoxified by the enzyme sulfite oxidase. Sulfite oxidase (EC 1.8.3.1) is 1 of 3 enzymes in humans that require molybdenum as a cofactor. Under certain circumstances, chronically high levels of sulfite can lead to serious neurotoxicity. Sulfite oxidase deficiency (also called molybdenum cofactor deficiency) is a rare autosomal inherited disease that is typified by high concentrations of sulfite in the blood and urine. It is characterized by severe neurological symptoms such as untreatable seizures, attenuated growth of the brain, and mental retardation. It results from defects in the enzyme sulfite oxidase, which is responsible for the oxidation of sulfite to sulfate. This sulfite to sulfate reaction is the final step in the degradation of sulfur-containing metabolites (including the amino acids cysteine and methionine). The term ""isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency"" is used to define the deficiency caused by mutations in the sulfite oxidase gene. This differentiates it from another version of sulfite oxidase deficiency that is due to defects in the molybdenum cofactor biosynthetic pathway (with mutations in the MOCS1 or MOCS2 genes). Isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency is a rare but devastating neurologic disease that usually presents in early infancy with seizures and alterations in muscle tone (PMID: 16234925, 16140720, 8586770). Sulfite oxidase deficiency (as caused by MOCS1 or MOCS2) may be treated with cPMP, a precursor of the molybdenum cofactor (PMID: 20385644).  The mechanism behind sulfite neurotoxicity appears to be related to its ability to bind and inhibit glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). Inhibition of GDH leads to a decrease in alpha-ketoglutarate and a diminished flux through the tricarboxylic acid cycle. This is accompanied by a decrease in NADH through the mitochondrial electron transport chain, which leads to a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential and in ATP synthesis. Since glutamate is a major metabolite in the brain, inhibition of GDH by sulfite appears to contribute to neural damage characteristic of sulfite oxidase deficiency in human infants (PMID: 15273247).",Sulfite,HMDB0000240,,,C00094,SO3,FDB021915,so3,[O-]S([O-])=O,[so(OH)2]***Acide sulfureux***acido Sulfuroso***H2SO3***S(O)(OH)2***Schweflige saeure***Sulfite***Sulphurous acid***Acide sulphureux***acido Sulphuroso***Sulphite***Sulfur dioxide solution***Sulfuric(IV) acid (H2SO3),LSNNMFCWUKXFEE-UHFFFAOYSA-L,"InChI=1S/H2O3S/c1-4(2)3/h(H2,1,2,3)/p-2"

Serotonin is widely distributed in the nervous system of vertebrates and invertebrates and some of its behavioral effects have been preserved along evolution. Such is the case of aggressive behavior and rhythmic motor patterns , including those responsible for feeding. In vertebrates, which display a wider and much more sophisticated behavioral repertoire, serotonin also modulates sleep, the arousal state , sexual behavior, and others, and deficiencies of the serotonergic system causes disorders such as depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, phobias, posttraumatic stress disorder, epilepsy, and generalized anxiety disorder. Serotonin has three different modes of action in the nervous system: as transmitter, acting locally at synaptic boutons; upon diffusion at a distance from its release sites, producing paracrine (also called volume) effects, and by circulating in the blood stream, producing hormonal effects.

stcoa,362-66-3,15541,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Stearoyl-CoA is a long-chain acyl CoA ester that acts as an intermediate metabolite in the biosynthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids; a critical committed step in the reaction is the introduction of the cis-configuration double bond into acyl-CoAs (between carbons 9 and 10). This oxidative reaction is catalyzed by the iron-containing, microsomal enzyme, stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD, EC 1.14.19.1). NADH supplies the reducing equivalents for the reaction, the flavoprotein is cytochrome b5-reductase and the electron carrier is the heme protein cytochrome b5. Stearoyl-CoA is converted into oleoyl-CoA and then used as a major substrate for the synthesis of various kinds of lipids including phospholipids, triglycerides, cholesteryl esters and wax esters. Oleic acid is the preferred substrate for acyl-CoA cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT, EC 2.3.1.26) and diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT, EC 2.3.1.20), the enzymes responsible for cholesteryl esters and triglycerides synthesis, respectively. In addition oleate is the major monounsaturated fatty acid in human adipose tissue and in the phospholipid of the red-blood-cell membrane. In the biosynthesis of sphinganine, stearoyl-CoA proceeds through the acyl-CoA + serine -> 3-keto-sphinganine -> sphinganine pathway, with the key enzyme being acyl-CoA serine acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.50) to yield C20-(3-ketosphinganine) long-chain base. There is growing recognition that acyl-CoA esters could act as signaling molecules in cellular metabolism.

succ,110-15-6,15741,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Succinic acid is a dicarboxylic acid. The anion, succinate, is a component of the citric acid or TCA cycle and is capable of donating electrons to the electron transfer chain. Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) plays an important role in mitochondrial function, being both part of the respiratory chain and the Krebs cycle. SDH with a covalently attached FAD prosthetic group, is able to bind several different enzyme substrates (succinate and fumarate) and physiological regulators (oxaloacetate and ATP). Oxidizing succinate links SDH to the fast-cycling Krebs cycle portion where it participates in the breakdown of acetyl-CoA throughout the entire Krebs cycle. Succinate can readily be imported into the mitochondrial matrix by the n-butylmalonate- (or phenylsuccinate-) sensitive dicarboxylate carrier in exchange with inorganic phosphate or another organic acid, e. g. malate (PMID 16143825). Mutations in the four genes encoding the subunits of the mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase are associated with a wide spectrum of clinical presentations, i.e.: Huntington's disease (PMID 11803021 ). Moreover, succinic acid is found to be associated with D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria, which is an inborn error of metabolism. Succinic acid has recently been identified as an oncometabolite or an endogenous, cancer causing metabolite. High levels of this organic acid can be found in tumors or biofluids surrounding tumors. Its oncogenic action appears to due to its ability to inhibit prolyl hydroxylase-containing enzymes. In many tumours, oxygen availability becomes limited (hypoxia) very quickly due to rapid cell proliferation and limited blood vessel growth. The major regulator of the response to hypoxia is the HIF transcription factor (HIF-alpha). Under normal oxygen levels, protein levels of HIF-alpha are very low due to constant degradation, mediated by a series of post-translational modification events catalyzed by the prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing enzymes PHD1, 2 and 3, (also known as EglN2, 1 and 3) that hydroxylate HIF-alpha and lead to its degradation. All three of the PHD enzymes are inhibited by succinate.

Succinyl-CoA may be an end product of peroxisomal beta-oxidation of dicarboxylic fatty acids; the identification of an apparently specific succinyl-CoA thioesterase (ACOT4, EC 3.1.2.3, hydrolyzes succinyl-CoA) in peroxisomes strongly suggests that succinyl-CoA is formed in peroxisomes. Acyl-CoA thioesterases (ACOTs) are a family of enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of the CoA esters of various lipids to the free acids and coenzyme A, thereby regulating levels of these compounds.

It is obtained commercially from sugarcane, sugar beet (beta vulgaris), and other plants and used extensively as a food and a sweetener. Sucrose is derived by crushing and extraction of sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) with water or extraction of the sugar beet (Beta vulgaris) with water, evaporating, and purifying with lime, carbon, and various liquids. Sucrose is also obtainable from sorghum. Sucrose occurs in low percentages in honey and maple syrup. Sucrose is used as a sweetener in foods and soft drinks, in the manufacture of syrups, in invert sugar, confectionery, preserves and jams, demulcent, pharmaceutical products, and caramel. Sucrose is also a chemical intermediate for detergents, emulsifying agents, and other sucrose derivatives. Sucrose is wiidespread in seeds, leaves, fruits, flowers and roots of plants, where it functions as an energy store for metabolism and as a carbon source for biosynthesis. The annual world production of sucrose is in excess of 90 million tons mainly from the juice of sugar cane (20%) and sugar beet (17%).

sucsal,692-29-5,16265,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Succinic acid semialdehyde (or succinate semialdehyde) is an intermediate in the catabolism of gamma-aminobutyrate or GABA (PMID: 16435183). It is formed from GABA by the action of GABA transaminase, which leads to the production of succinate semialdehyde and alanine. The resulting succinate semialdehyde is further oxidized by succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase to become succinic acid, which also yields NADPH. Under certain situations, high levels of succinate semialdehyde can function as a neurotoxin and a metabotoxin. A neurotoxin is a compound that causes damage to the brain and nerve tissues. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Elevated serum levels of succinate semialdehyde are found in succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) deficiency (gamma-hydroxybutyric aciduria), a rare neurometabolic disorder of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) degradation. Symptoms include motor delay, hypotonia, speech delay, autistic features, seizures, and ataxia. Patients also exhibit behavioural problems such as attention deficit, hyperactivity, anxiety, or aggression (PMID: 18622364). Succinate semialdehyde is considered a reactive carbonyl and may lead to increased oxidative stress. This stress is believed to contribute to the formation of free radicals in the brain tissue of animal models induced with SSADH deficiency, which further leads to secondary cell damage and death. Additionally, oxidative stress may be responsible for the loss of striatal dopamine, which may contribute to the neuropathology of SSADH deficiency.",Succinic acid semialdehyde,HMDB0001259,,,C00232,SUCC-S-ALD,FDB022516,sucsal,[H]C(=O)C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([O-])=O,"3-Formylpropanoic acid***3-Formylpropionic acid***4-Oxobutanoate***beta-Formylpropionic acid***Semialdehyde succinique***Succinaldehydic acid***Succinate semialdehyde***3-Formylpropanoate***3-Formylpropionate***4-Oxobutanoic acid***b-Formylpropionate***b-Formylpropionic acid***beta-Formylpropionate***β-formylpropionate***β-formylpropionic acid***Succinaldehydate***2-Formylpropionic acid ethyl ester***Butryaldehydate***Butryaldehydic acid***gamma-Oxybutyrate***gamma-Oxybutyric acid***Succinic semialdehyde***Succinic semialdehyde, calcium salt",UIUJIQZEACWQSV-UHFFFAOYSA-M,"InChI=1S/C4H6O3/c5-3-1-2-4(6)7/h3H,1-2H2,(H,6,7)/p-1"

taur,107-35-7,15891,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Taurine is a sulfur amino acid like methionine, cystine, cysteine and homocysteine. It is a lesser-known amino acid because it is not incorporated into the structural building blocks of protein. Yet taurine is an essential amino acid in pre-term and newborn infants of humans and many other species. Adults can synthesize their own taurine, yet are probably dependent in part on dietary taurine. Taurine is abundant in the brain, heart, breast, gallbladder and kidney and has important roles in health and disease in these organs. Taurine has many diverse biological functions serving as a neurotransmitter in the brain, a stabilizer of cell membranes and a facilitator in the transport of ions such as sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium. Taurine is highly concentrated in animal and fish protein, which are good sources of dietary taurine. It can be synthesized by the body from cysteine when vitamin B6 is present. Deficiency of taurine occurs in premature infants and neonates fed formula milk, and in various disease states. Inborn errors of taurine metabolism have been described. OMIM 168605, an unusual neuropsychiatric disorder inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion through 3 generations of a family. Symptoms began late in the fifth decade in 6 affected persons and death occurred after 4 to 6 years. The earliest and most prominent symptom was mental depression not responsive to antidepressant drugs or electroconvulsive therapy. Sleep disturbances, exhaustion and marked weight loss were features. Parkinsonism developed later, and respiratory failure occurred terminally. OMIM 145350 describes congestive cardiomyopathy and markedly elevated urinary taurine levels (about 5 times normal). Other family members had late or holosystolic mitral valve prolapse and elevated urinary taurine values (about 2.5 times normal). In 2 with mitral valve prolapse, congestive cardiomyopathy eventually developed while the amounts of urinary taurine doubled. Taurine, after GABA, is the second most important inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. Its inhibitory effect is one source of taurine's anticonvulsant and antianxiety properties. It also lowers glutamic acid in the brain, and preliminary clinical trials suggest taurine may be useful in some forms of epilepsy. Taurine in the brain is usually associated with zinc or manganese. The amino acids alanine and glutamic acid, as well as pantothenic acid, inhibit taurine metabolism while vitamins A and B6, zinc and manganese help build taurine. Cysteine and B6 are the nutrients most directly involved in taurine synthesis. Taurine levels have been found to decrease significantly in many depressed patients. One reason that the findings are not entirely clear is because taurine is often elevated in the blood of epileptics who need it. It is often difficult to distinguish compensatory changes in human biochemistry from true metabolic or deficiency disease. Low levels of taurine are found in retinitis pigmentosa. Taurine deficiency in experimental animals produces degeneration of light-sensitive cells. Therapeutic applications of taurine to eye disease are likely to be forthcoming. Taurine has many important metabolic roles. Supplements can stimulate prolactin and insulin release. The parathyroid gland makes a peptide hormone called glutataurine (glutamic acid-taurine), which further demonstrates taurine's role in endocrinology. Taurine increases bilirubin and cholesterol excretion in bile, critical to normal gallbladder function. It seems to inhibit the effect of morphine and potentiates the effects of opiate antagonists. Low plasma taurine levels have been found in a variety of conditions, i.e., depression, hypertension, hypothyroidism, gout, institutionalized patients, infertility, obesity, kidney failure and others (http://www.dcnutrition.com/AminoAcids/). Moreover, taurine is found to be associated with maple syrup urine disease, which is an inborn error of metabolism.",Taurine,HMDB0000251,,,C00245,,FDB003191,taur,[H][N+]([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])S([O-])(=O)=O,"2-Aminoethanesulfonic acid***2-Aminoethyl sulfonate***Aminoethylsulfonic acid***beta-Aminoethylsulfonic acid***2-Aminoethanesulfonate***2-Aminoethanesulphonate***2-Aminoethanesulphonic acid***2-Aminoethyl sulfonic acid***2-Aminoethyl sulphonate***2-Aminoethyl sulphonic acid***Aminoethylsulfonate***Aminoethylsulphonate***Aminoethylsulphonic acid***b-Aminoethylsulfonate***b-Aminoethylsulfonic acid***b-Aminoethylsulphonate***b-Aminoethylsulphonic acid***beta-Aminoethylsulfonate***beta-Aminoethylsulphonate***beta-Aminoethylsulphonic acid***β-aminoethylsulfonate***β-aminoethylsulfonic acid***β-aminoethylsulphonate***β-aminoethylsulphonic acid***1-Aminoethane-2-sulfonate***1-Aminoethane-2-sulfonic acid***2-Aminoethylsulfonate***2-Aminoethylsulfonic acid***2-Sulfoethylamine***Taurine hydrochloride***Taurine zinc salt (2:1)***Taurine, monopotassium salt***Taufon***Tauphon",XOAAWQZATWQOTB-UHFFFAOYSA-N,"InChI=1S/C2H7NO3S/c3-1-2-7(4,5)6/h1-3H2,(H,4,5,6)"

tchola,81-24-3,28865,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Taurocholic acid is a bile acid and is the product of conjugation of cholic acid with taurine. Its sodium salt is the chief ingredient of the bile of carnivorous animals. Bile acids are steroid acids found predominantly in bile of mammals. The distinction between different bile acids is minute, depends only on presence or absence of hydroxyl groups on positions 3, 7, and 12. Bile acids are physiological detergents that facilitate excretion, absorption, and transport of fats and sterols in the intestine and liver. Bile acids are also steroidal amphipathic molecules derived from the catabolism of cholesterol. They modulate bile flow and lipid secretion, are essential for the absorption of dietary fats and vitamins, and have been implicated in the regulation of all the key enzymes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Bile acids recirculate through the liver, bile ducts, small intestine and portal vein to form an enterohepatic circuit. They exist as anions at physiological pH and, consequently, require a carrier for transport across the membranes of the enterohepatic tissues. The unique detergent properties of bile acids are essential for the digestion and intestinal absorption of hydrophobic nutrients. Bile acids have potent toxic properties (e.g., membrane disruption) and there are a plethora of mechanisms to limit their accumulation in blood and tissues. (PMID: 11316487 , 16037564 , 12576301 , 11907135 ) Taurocholic acid, as with all bile acids, acts as a detergent to solubilize fats for absorption and is itself absorbed. It is used as a cholagogue and cholerectic (a bile purging agent). Hydrolysis of taurocholic acid yields taurine, a nonessential amino acid. Taurocholic acid is one of the main components of urinary nonsulfated bile acids in biliary atresia. Raised levels of the bile acid taurocholate in the fetal serum in obstetric cholestasis may result in the development of a fetal dysrhythmia and in sudden intra-uterine death.

It is also used in the myristoylation of proteins. The first pass through the beta-oxidation process starts with the saturated fatty acid palmitoyl-CoA and produces myristoyl-CoA. A total of four enzymatic steps are required, starting with VLCAD CoA dehydrogenase (Very Long Chain) activity, followed by three enzymatic steps catalyzed by enoyl-CoA hydratase, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, all present in the mitochondria. Myristoylation of proteins is also catalyzed by the presence of myristoyl-CoA along with Myristoyl-CoA:protein N-myristoyltransferase (NMT). Myristoylation is an irreversible, co-translational (during translation) protein modification found in animals, plants, fungi and viruses. In this protein modification a myristoyl group (derived from myristioyl CoA) is covalently attached via an amide bond to the alpha-amino group of an N-terminal amino acid of a nascent polypeptide. It is more common on glycine residues but also occurs on other amino acids. Myristoylation also occurs post-translationally, for example when previously internal glycine residues become exposed by caspase cleavage during apoptosis. Myristoylation plays a vital role in membrane targeting and signal transduction in plant responses to environmental stress.

tdechola,516-50-7,9410,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Taurodeoxycholic acid is a bile salt formed in the liver by conjugation of deoxycholate with taurine, usually as the sodium salt. Bile acids are steroid acids found predominantly in bile of mammals. The distinction between different bile acids is minute, depends only on presence or absence of hydroxyl groups on positions 3, 7, and 12. Bile acids are physiological detergents that facilitate excretion, absorption, and transport of fats and sterols in the intestine and liver. Bile acids are also steroidal amphipathic molecules derived from the catabolism of cholesterol. They modulate bile flow and lipid secretion, are essential for the absorption of dietary fats and vitamins, and have been implicated in the regulation of all the key enzymes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Bile acids recirculate through the liver, bile ducts, small intestine and portal vein to form an enterohepatic circuit. They exist as anions at physiological pH and, consequently, require a carrier for transport across the membranes of the enterohepatic tissues. The unique detergent properties of bile acids are essential for the digestion and intestinal absorption of hydrophobic nutrients. Bile acids have potent toxic properties (e.g., membrane disruption) and there are a plethora of mechanisms to limit their accumulation in blood and tissues.

Distribution of 24:6n-3 in marine organisms was investigated by several researchers. Takagi et al. reported relatively high contents of 24:6n-3 in sea lilies and brittle stars (4&#8211;10% of total fatty acids). High 24:6n-3 content was also found in marine coelenterates. In some edible fishes, 24:6n-3 was detected at significant levels (0&#8211;10% of total fatty acids).The existence of 24:6n-3 in mammalian tissues was reported with other very long chain fatty acids in the spermatozoa,the retina, and the brain. Voss et al. reported that 24:6n-3 is formed as an intermediate in the metabolic pathway from 20:5n-3 to 22:6n-3 in rat liver. Even though 24:6n-3 is a PUFA existing in fish and mammalian species, physiological functions of 24:6n-3 have not been studied. As functions to be studied, anti-inflammatory and antiallergic. effects of 24:6n-3 are noteworthy because these events are known to be closely related to the unsaturated fatty acid metabolism such as in the arachidonic acid cascade, and 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 were reported to suppress inflammatory actions by influencing arachidonic acid metabolism.s24:6n-3 could inhibit the antigen-stimulated production of LT-related compounds as well as other n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) such as eicosapentaenoic. acid (20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3), which are major n-3 PUFA in fish oils; 24:6n-3 was also shown to reduce the histamine content in MC/9 cells at 25 uM (27% reduction from the control), and the effect was diminished with increase of the fatty acid concentration (up to 100 uM). These two n-3 PUFA, 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3, also reduced the histamine content (16 and 20% reduction at 25 &#956;M, respectively), whereas arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) increased it (18% increase at 25 &#956;M).

thbpt,17528-72-2,15372,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Tetrahydrobiopterin or BH4 is a cofactor in the synthesis of nitric oxide. In fact it is used by all three human nitric-oxide synthases (NOS) eNOS, nNOS, and iNOS as well as the enzyme glyceryl-ether monooxygenase. It is also essential in the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine by the enzyme phenylalanine-4-hydroxylase; the conversion of tyrosine to L-dopa by the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase; and conversion of tryptophan to 5-hydroxytryptophan via tryptophan hydroxylase. Specifically, tetrahydrobiopterin is a cofactor for tryptophan 5-hydroxylase 1, tyrosine 3-monooxygenase, and phenylalanine hydroxylase all of which are essential for the formation of the neurotransmitters dopamine, noradrenaline and adrenaline. Tetrahydrobiopterin has been proposed to be involved in promotion of neurotransmitter release in the brain and the regulation of human melanogenesis.

Bile acids are physiological detergents that facilitate excretion, absorption, and transport of fats and sterols in the intestine and liver. Bile acids are also steroidal amphipathic molecules derived from the catabolism of cholesterol. They modulate bile flow and lipid secretion, are essential for the absorption of dietary fats and vitamins, and have been implicated in the regulation of all the key enzymes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Bile acids recirculate through the liver, bile ducts, small intestine and portal vein to form an enterohepatic circuit. They exist as anions at physiological pH and, consequently, require a carrier for transport across the membranes of the enterohepatic tissues.

The desulfuration reaction of cystine in vivo produces thiocysteine containing a bound sulfur atom. Persulfide generated from L-cysteine inactivates tyrosine aminotransferase. Thiocysteine is the reactive (unstable) intermediate of thiocystine which functions as a persulfide in transferring its sulfane sulfur to thiophilic acceptors. Thiocystine conversion to unstable thiocysteine is accelerated by sulfhydryl compounds, or reagents that cleave sulfur-sulfur bonds to yield sulfhydryl groups. Thiocystine is proposed as the storage form of sulfane sulfur in biological systems. Liver cytosols contain factors that produce an inhibitor of tyrosine aminotransferase in 3 steps: initial oxidation of cysteine to form cystine; desulfurization of cystine catalyzed by cystathionase to form the persulfide, thiocysteine; and reaction of thiocysteine (or products of its decomposition) with proteins to form protein-bound sulfane.

thdp,,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Tetrahydrodipicolinate, converted from L-aspartate, is an important intermediate in lysine biosynthesis pathway. Several pathways are now recognized in bacteria, most algae, fungi and higher plants for the biosynthesis of lysine. They are divided into two groups - the diaminopimelate (DAP) pathways, and the &#945;-aminoadipate (AAA) pathways. In the pathways that belong to the DAP group, lysine is produced from aspartate (along with methionine, threonine and isoleucine). All of these pathways share the upper segments, which include the four steps required for conversion of L-aspartate to tetrahydrodipicolinate. They also share the last step, which is the conversion of the intermediate meso-diaminopimelate (D,L-DAP, or meso-DAP) to lysine. However, these pathways differ in the routes leading from tetrahydrodipicolinate to meso-diaminopimelate. The four variations include: (I) the succinylase variant, which involves succinylated intermediates. In this route tetrahydrodipicolinate is coverted to meso-diaminopimelate in four enzymatic steps; (II) the acetylase variant, which involves acetylated intermediates. This route also involves four enzymatic steps for the conversion of tetrahydrodipicolinate to meso-diaminopimelate; (III) the dehydrogenase variant, in which tetrahydrodipicolinate is converted to meso-diaminopimelate in a single enzymatic step; (IV) the diaminopimelate-aminotransferase variant, in which tetrahydrodipicolinate is converted to meso-diaminopimelate in two steps.

thf,135-16-0,20506,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Tetrahydrofolate is a soluble coenzyme (vitamin B9) that is synthesized de novo by plants and microorganisms, and absorbed from the diet by animals. It is composed of three distinct parts: a pterin ring, a p-ABA (p-aminobenzoic acid) and a polyglutamate chain with a number of residues varying between 1 and 8. Only the tetra-reduced form of the molecule serves as a coenzyme for C1 transfer reactions. In biological systems, the C1-units exist under various oxidation states and the different tetrahydrofolate derivatives constitute a family of related molecules named indistinctly under the generic term folate. (PMID 16042593). Folate is important for cells and tissues that rapidly divide. Cancer cells divide rapidly, and drugs that interfere with folate metabolism are used to treat cancer. Methotrexate is a drug often used to treat cancer because it inhibits the production of the active form, tetrahydrofolate. Unfortunately, methotrexate can be toxic, producing side effects such as inflammation in the digestive tract that make it difficult to eat normally. -- Wikipedia; Signs of folic acid deficiency are often subtle. Diarrhea, loss of appetite, and weight loss can occur. Additional signs are weakness, sore tongue, headaches, heart palpitations, irritability, and behavioral disorders. Women with folate deficiency who become pregnant are more likely to give birth to low birth weight and premature infants, and infants with neural tube defects. In adults, anemia is a sign of advanced folate deficiency. In infants and children, folate deficiency can slow growth rate. Some of these symptoms can also result from a variety of medical conditions other than folate deficiency. It is important to have a physician evaluate these symptoms so that appropriate medical care can be given. -- Wikipedia; Folinic acid is a form of folate that can help 'rescue' or reverse the toxic effects of methotrexate. Folinic acid is not the same as folic acid. Folic acid supplements have little established role in cancer chemotherapy. There have been cases of severe adverse effects of accidental substitution of folic acid for folinic acid in patients receiving methotrexate cancer chemotherapy. It is important for anyone receiving methotrexate to follow medical advice on the use of folic or folinic acid supplements. -- Wikipedia. Low concentrations of folate, vitamin B12, or vitamin B6 may increase the level of homocysteine, an amino acid normally found in blood. There is evidence that an elevated homocysteine level is an independent risk factor for heart disease and stroke. The evidence suggests that high levels of homocysteine may damage coronary arteries or make it easier for blood clotting cells called platelets to clump together and form a clot. However, there is currently no evidence available to suggest that lowering homocysteine with vitamins will reduce your risk of heart disease. Clinical intervention trials are needed to determine whether supplementation with folic acid, vitamin B12 or vitamin B6 can lower your risk of developing coronary heart disease. -- Wikipedia.",Tetrahydrofolic acid,HMDB0001846,,,C00101,THF,FDB022705,thf,[H]OC1=NC(=NC2=C1N([H])C([H])(C([H])([H])N([H])C1=C([H])C([H])=C(C([H])=C1[H])C(=O)N([H])C([H])(C([O-])=O)C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([O-])=O)C([H])([H])N2[H])N([H])[H],"(6S)-Tetrahydrofolate***(6S)-Tetrahydrofolic acid***5,6,7,8-Tetrahydrofolate***5,6,7,8-Tetrahydrofolic acid***Tetra-H-folate***Tetrahydrafolate***Tetrahydrofolate***Tetrahydropteroyl mono-L-glutamate***Tetrahydropteroylglutamate",MSTNYGQPCMXVAQ-UHFFFAOYSA-L,"InChI=1S/C19H23N7O6/c20-19-25-15-14(17(30)26-19)23-11(8-22-15)7-21-10-3-1-9(2-4-10)16(29)24-12(18(31)32)5-6-13(27)28/h1-4,11-12,21,23H,5-8H2,(H,24,29)(H,27,28)(H,31,32)(H4,20,22,25,26,30)/p-2"

thmpp,154-87-0,9532,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Thiamine pyrophosphate is the active form of thiamine, and it serves as a cofactor for several enzymes involved primarily in carbohydrate catabolism. The enzymes are important in the biosynthesis of a number of cell constituents, including neurotransmitters, and for the production of reducing equivalents used in oxidant stress defenses and in biosyntheses and for synthesis of pentoses used as nucleic acid precursors. The chemical structure of TPP is that of an aromatic methylaminopyrimidine ring, linked via a methylene bridge to a methylthiazolium ring with a pyrophosphate group attached to a hydroxyethyl side chain. In non-enzymatic model studies it has been demonstrated that the thiazolium ring can catalyse reactions which are similar to those of TPP-dependent enzymes but several orders of magnitude slower. Using infrared and NMR spectrophotometry it has been shown that the dissociation of the proton from C2 of the thiazolium ring is necessary for catalysis; the abstraction of the proton leads to the formation of a carbanion (ylid) with the potential for a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl group of the substrate. In all TPP-dependent enzymes the abstraction of the proton from the C2 atom is the first step in catalysis, which is followed by a nucleophilic attack of this carbanion on the substrate. Subsequent cleavage of a C-C bond releases the first product with formation of a second carbanion (2-greek small letter alpha-carbanion or enamine). The formation of this 2-greek small letter alpha-carbanion is the second feature of TPP catalysis common to all TPP-dependent enzymes. Depending on the enzyme and the substrate(s), the reaction intermediates and products differ. Methyl-branched fatty acids, as phytanic acid, undergo peroxisomal beta-oxidation in which they are shortened by 1 carbon atom. This process includes four steps: activation, 2-hydroxylation, thiamine pyrophosphate dependent cleavage and aldehyde dehydrogenation. In the third step, 2-hydroxy-3-methylacyl-CoA is cleaved in the peroxisomal matrix by 2-hydroxyphytanoyl-CoA lyase (2-HPCL), which uses thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) as cofactor. The thiamine pyrophosphate dependence of the third step is unique in peroxisomal mammalian enzymology. Human pathology due to a deficient alpha-oxidation is mostly linked to mutations in the gene coding for the second enzyme of the sequence, phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase (EC 1.14.11.18).

thr_L,72-19-5,16857,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Threonine is an essential amino acid in humans. It is abundant in human plasma, particularly in newborns. Severe deficiency of threonine causes neurological dysfunction and lameness in experimental animals. Threonine is an immunostimulant which promotes the growth of thymus gland. It also can probably promote cell immune defense function. This amino acid has been useful in the treatment of genetic spasticity disorders and multiple sclerosis at a dose of 1 gram daily. It is highly concentrated in meat products, cottage cheese and wheat germ. (http://www.dcnutrition.com/AminoAcids/) The threonine content of most of the infant formulas currently on the market is approximately 20% higher than the threonine concentration in human milk. Due to this high threonine content the plasma threonine concentrations are up to twice as high in premature infants fed these formulas than in infants fed human milk. The whey proteins which are used for infant formulas are sweet whey proteins. Sweet whey results from cheese production. Threonine catabolism in mammals appears to be due primarily (70-80%) to the activity of threonine dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.103) that oxidizes threonine to 2-amino-3-oxobutyrate, which forms glycine and acetyl CoA, whereas threonine dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.16) that catabolizes threonine into 2-oxobutyrate and ammonia, is significantly less active. Increasing the threonine plasma concentrations leads to accumulation of threonine and glycine in the brain. Such accumulation affects the neurotransmitter balance which may have consequences for the brain development during early postnatal life. Thus, excessive threonine intake during infant feeding should be avoided.

Bile acids are physiological detergents that facilitate excretion, absorption, and transport of fats and sterols in the intestine and liver. Bile acids are also steroidal amphipathic molecules derived from the catabolism of cholesterol. They modulate bile flow and lipid secretion, are essential for the absorption of dietary fats and vitamins, and have been implicated in the regulation of all the key enzymes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Bile acids recirculate through the liver, bile ducts, small intestine and portal vein to form an enterohepatic circuit. They exist as anions at physiological pH and, consequently, require a carrier for transport across the membranes of the enterohepatic tissues. The unique detergent properties of bile acids are essential for the digestion and intestinal absorption of hydrophobic nutrients. Bile acids have potent toxic properties (e.g., membrane disruption) and there are a plethora of mechanisms to limit their accumulation in blood and tissues.

One effect of administering the thyronamines is a severe drop in body temperature. Iodide is actively absorbed from the bloodstream and concentrated in the thyroid follicles. (If there is a deficiency of dietary iodine, the thyroid enlarges in an attempt to trap more iodine, resulting in goitre.) Via a reaction with the enzyme thyroperoxidase, iodine is covalently bound to tyrosine residues in the thyroglobulin molecules, forming monoiodotyrosine (MIT) and diiodotyrosine (DIT). Linking two moieties of DIT produces thyroxine. Combining one particle of MIT and one particle of DIT produces triiodothyronine. Both T3 and T4 are used to treat thyroid hormone deficiency (hypothyroidism). They are both absorbed well by the gut, so can be given orally. Levothyroxine, the most commonly used synthetic thyroxine form, is a stereoisomer of physiological thyroxine, which is metabolized more slowly and hence usually only needs once-daily administration.

Trimethylamine has a boiling point of 2.9 degree centigrade and is a gas at room temperature. Trimethylamine usually comes in pressurized gas cylinders or as a 40% solution in water. Trimethylamine is a nitrogenous base and its positively charged cation is called trimethylammonium cation. A common salt of trimethylamine is trimethylammonium chloride, a hygroscopic colorless solid (Wikipedia). Trimethylamine is a product of decomposition of plants and animals. It is the substance mainly responsible for the fishy odor often associated with fouling fish, bacterial vagina infections, and bad breath. It is also associated with taking large doses of choline (Wikipedia). Trimethylaminuria is a genetic disorder in which the body is unable to metabolize trimethylamine from food sources. Patients develop a characteristic fish odour of their sweat, urine, and breath after the consumption of choline-rich foods.

tmao,62637-93-8,15724,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is an oxidation product of trimethylamine and a common metabolite in animals and humans. In particular, trimethylamine-N-oxide is biosynthesized endogenously from trimethylamine, which is derived from choline, which can be derived from dietary lecithin (phosphatidylcholines) or dietary carnitine. TMAO decomposes to trimethylamine (TMA), which is the main odorant that is characteristic of degrading seafood. TMAO is an osmolyte that the body will use to counteract the effects of increased concentrations of urea (due to kidney failure) and high levels can be used as a biomarker for kidney problems. Fish odor syndrome or trimethylaminuria is a defect in the production of the enzyme flavin containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3) causing incomplete breakdown of trimethylamine from choline-containing food into trimethylamine oxide. Trimethylamine then builds up and is released in the person's sweat, urine, and breath, giving off a strong fishy odor. The concentration of TMAO in the blood increases after consuming foods containing carnitine or lecithin (phosphatidylcholines), if the bacteria that convert those substances to TMAO are present in the gut (PMID: 23614584). High concentrations of carnitine are found in red meat, some energy drinks, and certain dietary supplements; lecithin is found in eggs and is commonly used as an ingredient in processed food. High levels of TMAO are found in many seafoods.  Some types of normal gut bacteria (e.g. species of Acinetobacter) in the human gut convert dietary carnitine and dietary lecithin to TMAO (PMID: 21475195). TMAO alters cholesterol metabolism in the intestines, in the liver and in arterial wall. When TMAO is present, cholesterol metabolism is altered and there is an increased deposition of cholesterol within, and decreased removal of cholesterol from, peripheral cells such as those in the artery wall (PMID: 23563705). Urinary TMAO is a biomarker for the consumption of fish, especially cold-water fish.

tolbutamide,64-77-7,27999,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Tolbutamide is an oral antihyperglycemic agent used for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). It is structurally similar to acetohexamide, chlorpropamide and tolazamide and belongs to the sulfonylurea class of insulin secretagogues, which act by stimulating cells of the pancreas to release insulin. Sulfonylureas increase both basal insulin secretion and meal-stimulated insulin release. Medications in this class differ in their dose, rate of absorption, duration of action, route of elimination and binding site on their target pancreatic cell receptor. Sulfonylureas also increase peripheral glucose utilization, decrease hepatic gluconeogenesis and may increase the number and sensitivity of insulin receptors. Sulfonylureas are associated with weight gain, though less so than insulin. Due to their mechanism of action, sulfonylureas may cause hypoglycemia and require consistent food intake to decrease this risk. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased in elderly, debilitated and malnourished individuals. Tolbutamide appears to be metabolized in the liver. Tolbutamide and its metabolites are excreted in urine (75-85%) and feces.

tre,99-20-7,16551,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Trehalose, also known as mycose, is a 1-alpha (disaccharide) sugar found extensively but not abundantly in nature. It is thought to be implicated in anhydrobiosis - the ability of plants and animals to withstand prolonged periods of desiccation. The sugar is thought to form a gel phase as cells dehydrate, which prevents disruption of internal cell organelles by effectively splinting them in position. Rehydration then allows normal cellular activity to be resumed without the major, generally lethal damage that would normally follow a dehydration/reyhdration cycle. Trehalose is a non-reducing sugar formed from two glucose units joined by a 1-1 alpha bond giving it the name of alpha-D-glucopyranoglucopyranosyl-1,1-alpha-D-glucopyranoside. The bonding makes trehalose very resistant to acid hydrolysis, and therefore stable in solution at high temperatures even under acidic conditions. The bonding also keeps non-reducing sugars in closed-ring form, such that the aldehyde or ketone end-groups do not bind to the lysine or arginine residues of proteins (a process called glycation). The enzyme trehalase, present but not abundant in most people, breaks it into two glucose molecules, which can then be readily absorbed in the gut.

trp_L,73-22-3,16828,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Tryptophan is an essential amino acid that is the precursor of both serotonin and melatonin. Melatonin is a hormone that is produced by the pineal gland in animals, which regulates sleep and wakefulness. Serotonin is a brain neurotransmitter, platelet clotting factor, and neurohormone found in organs throughout the body. Metabolism of tryptophan into serotonin requires nutrients such as vitamin B6, niacin, and glutathione. Niacin (also known as vitamin B3) is an important metabolite of tryptophan. It is synthesized via kynurenine and quinolinic acids, which are products of tryptophan degradation. There are a number of conditions or diseases that are characterized tryptophan deficiencies. For instance, fructose malabsorption causes improper absorption of tryptophan in the intestine, which reduces levels of tryptophan in the blood and leads to depression. High corn or other tryptophan-deficient diets can cause pellagra, which is a niacin-tryptophan deficiency disease with symptoms of dermatitis, diarrhea, and dementia. Hartnup's disease is a disorder in which tryptophan and other amino acids are not absorbed properly. Symptoms of Hartnup's disease include skin rashes, difficulty coordinating movements (cerebellar ataxia), and psychiatric symptoms such as depression or psychosis. Tryptophan supplements may be useful for treating Hartnup's. Assessment of tryptophan deficiency is done through studying excretion of tryptophan metabolites in the urine or blood. Blood may be the most sensitive test because the amino acid tryptophan is transported in a unique way. Increased urination of tryptophan breakdown products (such as kynurenine) correlates with increased tryptophan degradation, which occurs with oral contraception, depression, mental retardation, hypertension, and anxiety states. The requirement for tryptophan and protein decreases with age. The minimum daily requirement for adults is 3 mg/kg/day or about 200 mg a day. There is 400 mg of tryptophan in a cup of wheat germ. A cup of low fat cottage cheese contains 300 mg of tryptophan and chicken and turkey contain up to 600 mg of tryptophan per pound (http://www.dcnutrition.com). Tryptophan plays a role in ""feast-induced"" drowsiness. Ingestion of a meal rich in carbohydrates triggers the release of insulin. Insulin, in turn, stimulates the uptake of large neutral branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) into muscle, increasing the ratio of tryptophan to BCAA in the bloodstream. The increased tryptophan ratio reduces competition at the large neutral amino acid transporter (which transports both BCAAs and tryptophan), resulting in greater uptake of tryptophan across the blood-brain barrier into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Once in the CSF, tryptophan is converted into serotonin and the resulting serotonin is further metabolized into melatonin by the pineal gland, which promotes sleep. Under certain situations, tryptophan can be a neurotoxin and a metabotoxin. A neurotoxin is a compound that causes damage to the brain and nerve tissues. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of tryptophan can be found in glutaric aciduria type I (glutaric acidemia type I or GA1). GA1 is an inherited disorder in which the body is unable to completely break down the amino acids lysine, hydroxylysine, and tryptophan. Babies with glutaric acidemia type I are often born with unusually large heads (macrocephaly). Affected individuals may also have difficulty moving and may experience spasms, jerking, rigidity or decreased muscle tone, and muscle weakness. High levels of tryptophan have also been implicated in eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS), an incurable and sometimes fatal flu-like neurological condition linked to the ingestion of large amounts of L-tryptophan. The risk of developing EMS increases with larger doses of tryptophan and increasing age. Some research suggests that certain genetic polymorphisms may be related to the development of EMS. The presence of eosinophilia is a core feature of EMS, along with unusually severe myalgia (muscle pain). It is thought that both tryptophan and certain unidentified tryptophan contaminants may contribute to EMS (PMID: 1763543). It has also been suggested that excessive tryptophan or elevation of its metabolites could play a role in amplifying some of the pathological features of EMS (PMID: 10721094). This pathological damage is further augmented by metabolites of the kynurenine pathway (a tryptophan degradation pathway).",L-Tryptophan,HMDB0000929,,,C00078,TRP,FDB002250,trp_L,[H]N1C([H])=C(C2=C([H])C([H])=C([H])C([H])=C12)C([H])([H])[C@@]([H])(C([O-])=O)[N+]([H])([H])[H],(2S)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)Propanoic acid***(S)-alpha-amino-1H-Indole-3-propanoic acid***(S)-alpha-amino-beta-(3-Indolyl)-propionic acid***(S)-Tryptophan***L-(-)-Tryptophan***L-beta-3-Indolylalanine***Trp***Tryptophan***W***(2S)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)Propanoate***(S)-a-amino-1H-Indole-3-propanoate***(S)-a-amino-1H-Indole-3-propanoic acid***(S)-alpha-amino-1H-Indole-3-propanoate***(S)-α-amino-1H-indole-3-propanoate***(S)-α-amino-1H-indole-3-propanoic acid***(S)-a-amino-b-(3-Indolyl)-propionate***(S)-a-amino-b-(3-Indolyl)-propionic acid***(S)-alpha-amino-beta-(3-Indolyl)-propionate***(S)-α-amino-β-(3-indolyl)-propionate***(S)-α-amino-β-(3-indolyl)-propionic acid***L-b-3-Indolylalanine***L-β-3-indolylalanine***(-)-Tryptophan***(L)-Tryptophan***(S)-1H-Indole-3-alanine***(S)-2-amino-3-(3-Indolyl)propionic acid***(S)-a-amino-b-Indolepropionate***(S)-a-amino-b-Indolepropionic acid***(S)-a-Aminoindole-3-propionate***(S)-a-Aminoindole-3-propionic acid***(S)-alpha-amino-beta-Indolepropionate***(S)-alpha-amino-beta-Indolepropionic acid***(S)-alpha-Aminoindole-3-propionate***(S)-alpha-Aminoindole-3-propionic acid***1-beta-3-Indolylalanine***1beta-3-Indolylalanine***1H-Indole-3-alanine***2-amino-3-Indolylpropanoate***2-amino-3-Indolylpropanoic acid***3-(1H-indol-3-yl)-L-Alanine***3-indol-3-Ylalanine***Alpha'-amino-3-indolepropionic acid***alpha-Aminoindole-3-propionic acid***Ardeytropin***H-TRP-OH***Indole-3-alanine***Kalma***L-alpha-amino-3-Indolepropionic acid***L-alpha-Aminoindole-3-propionic acid***L-Tryptofan***L-Tryptophane***Lopac-T-0254***Lyphan***Optimax***Pacitron***Sedanoct***Triptofano***Trofan***Tryptacin***Tryptan***Tryptophane***Tryptophanum***Ardeydorm***L Tryptophan***L-Tryptophan-ratiopharm***Merck brand OF tryptophan***Niddapharm brand OF tryptophan***ICN brand OF tryptophan***Levotryptophan***PMS Tryptophan***PMS-Tryptophan***Ratiopharm brand OF tryptophan***Esparma brand OF tryptophan***ratio-Tryptophan***L Tryptophan ratiopharm***Naturruhe***Tryptophan metabolism alterations***Ardeypharm brand OF tryptophan***Kalma brand OF tryptophan***Pharmascience brand OF tryptophan***Upsher-smith brand OF tryptophan***ratio Tryptophan,QIVBCDIJIAJPQS-VIFPVBQESA-N,"InChI=1S/C11H12N2O2/c12-9(11(14)15)5-7-6-13-10-4-2-1-3-8(7)10/h1-4,6,9,13H,5,12H2,(H,14,15)/t9-/m0/s1"

ts3,17592-07-3,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Tachysterol 3 is a normal human secosterooid metabolite from the class of vitamin D3 photoisomer derivatives. It is synthesized from 7-Dehydrocholesterol in the epidermis in response to ultraviolet irradiation. When human skin is exposed to ultraviolet radiation, epidermal 7-dehydrocholesterol is converted to previtamin D, and during prolonged exposure, the synthesis of previtamin D3 reaches a plateau at about 10 to 15 percent of the original 7-dehydrocholesterol content, and previtamin D3 is photoisomerized to two biologically inert isomers and tachysterol 3 is one of them (the other one being lumisterol 3). Therefore, tachysterol is a metabolite to chronic exposure to sunlight. Tachysterol 3, as well as other photoisomers of vitamin D3 and previtamin D3 has been demonstrated to have inhibited keratinocyte proliferation. Thus, sunlight provides vitamin D3 photoproducts that may act directly to regulate epidermal proliferation and differentiation under physiologic conditions.

Testosterone is synthesized and released by the Leydig cells that lie between the tubules and comprise less than 5% of the total testicular volume. testosterone diffuses into the seminiferous tubules where it is essential for maintaining spermatogenesis. Some binds to an androgen-binding protein (ABP) that is produced by the Sertoli cells and is homologous to the sex-hormone binding globulin that transports testosterone in the general circulation. The ABP carries testosterone in the testicular fluid where it maintains the activity of the accessory sex glands and may also help to retain testosterone within the tubule and bind excess free hormone. Some testosterone is converted to estradiol by Sertoli cell-derived aromatase enzyme. Leydig cell steroidogenesis is controlled primarily by luteinizing hormone with negative feedback of testosterone on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. The requirement of spermatogenesis for high local concentrations of testosterone means that loss of androgen production is likely to be accompanied by loss of spermatogenesis. Indeed, if testicular androgen production is inhibited by the administration of exogenous androgens then spermatogenesis ceases. This is the basis of using exogenous testosterone as a male contraceptive. testosterone is converted to dihydrotestosterone by 5a-reductase type 2 (EC 1.3.1.22, SRD5A2), the androgen with the highest affinity for the androgen receptor. SRD5A2 deficiency illustrates the importance of dihydrotestosterone for external virilization, as individuals with this condition have normal male internal structures but their external genitalia are of female appearance. There is now clear evidence that the human fetal testis and also the fetal adrenal gland is capable of testosterone biosynthesis during the first trimester. Regardless of the source of androgen production, the target tissue responds by male sexual differentiation of the external genitalia by the end of the first trimester. It is clear that testicular damage may result in loss of testosterone production or the loss of spermatogenesis or both. Loss of androgen production results in hypogonadism, the symptoms of which reflect the functions of testosterone. Male hypogonadism is defined as failure of the testes to produce normal amounts of testosterone, combined with signs and symptoms of androgen deficiency. Systemic testosterone levels fall by about 1% each year in men. Therefore, with increasing longevity and the aging of the population, the number of older men with testosterone deficiency will increase substantially over the next several decades. Serum testosterone levels decrease progressively in aging men, but the rate and magnitude of decrease vary considerably. Approximately 1% of healthy young men have total serum testosterone levels below normal; in contrast, approximately 20% of healthy men over age 60 years have serum testosterone levels below normal.

Testosterone is primarily secreted in the testes of males and the ovaries of females although small amounts are secreted by the adrenal glands. It is the principal male sex hormone and an anabolic steroid. In both males and females, it plays key roles in health and well-being. There is a sex difference in the median values of testosterone glucuronide in the amniotic fluid specimens 15-19 wk gestation between female (median 160 pM, range 64-465 pM) and male (median 817 pM, range 68-3707 pM). This difference, when used in conjunction with amniotic fluid unconjugated testosterone values, increase the predictive accuracy of fetal sexing from 95.4 to 98.9%. In human newborns and young infants, urinary testosterone sulfate is higher than glucuronide. The high sulfokinase activity in fetal and neonatal testes is more likely responsible for this phenomenon than an impaired glucuronizing capacity of the liver. Urinary excretion of testosterone glucuronide increases significantly during puberty. The level of testosterone glucuronide exceeds the level of unconjugated testosterone in human seminal plasma. Urinary testosterone glucuronide excretion is increased in women with virilizing adrenocortical tumors. Concentration of testosterone glucuronide in urine from women with breast tumor in urine samples is not different from patients with benign or malignant breast disease, either before or after the menopause.

It is the principal male sex hormone and an anabolic steroid. In both males and females, it plays key roles in health and well-being. On average, the adult male body produces about twenty times the amount of testosterone that an adult female's body does. Free testosterone (T) is transported into the cytoplasm of target tissue cells, where it can bind to the androgen receptor, or can be reduced to 5-alpha -dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by the cytoplasmic enzyme 5-alpha-reductase(5-alpha-reduktas). DHT binds to the same androgen receptor even more strongly than T, so that its androgenic potency is about 2.5 times that of T. The T-receptor or DHT-receptor complex undergoes a structural change that allows it to move into the cell nucleus and bind directly to specific nucleotide sequences of the chromosomal DNA. The areas of binding are called hormone response elements (HREs), and influence transcriptional activity of certain genes, producing the androgen effects. It is important to note that if there is a too low amount of 5-alpha-reductase(5-alfa-reduktas), the body (of a human) will continue growing into a female with testicles.",Testosterone sulfate,HMDB0002833,,,,,FDB023072,tststerones,[H]C1=C2C([H])([H])C([H])([H])[C@@]3([H])[C@]4([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])[C@]([H])(OS([O-])(=O)=O)[C@@]4(C([H])([H])[H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])[C@]3([H])[C@@]2(C([H])([H])[H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C1=O,"Testosterone-17beta-sulfate***Testosterone-17b-sulfate***Testosterone-17b-sulfuric acid***Testosterone-17b-sulphate***Testosterone-17b-sulphuric acid***Testosterone-17beta-sulfuric acid***Testosterone-17beta-sulphate***Testosterone-17beta-sulphuric acid***Testosterone-17β-sulfate***Testosterone-17β-sulfuric acid***Testosterone-17β-sulphate***Testosterone-17β-sulphuric acid***Testosterone sulfuric acid***Testosterone sulphate***Testosterone sulphuric acid***17-O-Sulfotestosterone***17beta-(Sulfooxy)androst-4-en-3-one***Testosterone 17-sulfate***Testosterone 17-sulphate***Testosterone 17b-sulfate***Testosterone 17b-sulphate***Testosterone hydrogen sulfate***Testosterone hydrogen sulphate***Testosterone monosulfate***Testosterone monosulphate***Testosterone-17-sulfate***Testosterone-17-sulphate***AndroGel***AstraZeneca brand OF testosterone***GlaxoSmithKline brand OF testosterone***Hauck brand OF testosterone***Schering brand OF testosterone***Testolin***Testosterone-17-sulfate, (17alpha)-isomer***Testosterone-17-sulfate, ammonium salt***Testosterone-17-sulfate, sodium salt***17 beta Hydroxy 4 androsten 3 one***17 beta Hydroxy 8 alpha 4 androsten 3 one***Histerone***Sustanon***17-beta-Hydroxy-4-androsten-3-one***Faulding brand OF testosterone***Ferring brand OF testosterone***8 Isotestosterone***8-Isotestosterone***Paladin brand OF testosterone***Pasadena brand OF testosterone***Solvay brand OF testosterone***Sterotate***Testosterone***Unimed brand OF testosterone***Dr. kade brand OF testosterone***Testim***Testopel***Andropatch***CEPA brand OF testosterone***ortho Brand OF testosterone***17-beta-Hydroxy-8 alpha-4-androsten-3-one***Auxilium pharmaceuticals inc. brand OF testosterone***Bartor brand OF testosterone***Ulmer brand OF testosterone***Watson brand OF testosterone***Androderm***Androtop***SmithKline beecham brand OF testosterone***Testoderm",WAQBISPOEAOCOG-DYKIIFRCSA-M,"InChI=1S/C19H28O5S/c1-18-9-7-13(20)11-12(18)3-4-14-15-5-6-17(24-25(21,22)23)19(15,2)10-8-16(14)18/h11,14-17H,3-10H2,1-2H3,(H,21,22,23)/p-1/t14-,15-,16-,17-,18-,19-/m0/s1"
tsul,,16094,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Thiosulfate occurs naturally in hot springs and geysers, and is produced by certain biochemical processes. In the body, thiosulfate converts small amounts of cyanide ion into harmless products and plays a role in the biosynthesis of cysteine, a sulfur-containing amino acid that locks proteins into their correct three-dimensional shapes. Thiosulfate is not found in large quantities in nature. Solutions of thiosulfate break down into sulfur, sulfites, and sulfates when exposed to acids, light, metal ions, and bacteria. Thiosulfate is sometimes used as an antidote for cyanide poisoning. It reacts with cyanide to produce sulfite and thiocyanate ions: CN- + S2O32- SCN- + SO32- This reaction is catalyzed by an enzyme produced by cell mitochondria to neutralize small quantities of ingested cyanide (which occurs naturally in cassava root, lima beans, and almonds!). Thiosulfate is an intermediate in several biochemical pathways, including the synthesis of L-cysteine. Thiosulfate is manufactured by some cells by oxidation of elemental sulfur and by degradation of L-cysteine.

The eicosanoids consist of the prostaglandins (PGs), thromboxanes (TXs), leukotrienes (LTs) and lipoxins (LXs). The PGs and TXs are collectively identified as prostanoids. Prostaglandins were originally shown to be synthesized in the prostate gland, thromboxanes from platelets (thrombocytes) and leukotrienes from leukocytes, hence the derivation of their names. All mammalian cells except erythrocytes synthesize eicosanoids. These molecules are extremely potent, able to cause profound physiological effects at very dilute concentrations.

tym,51-67-2,15760,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Tyramine is a monoamine compound derived from the amino acid tyrosine. Tyramine is metabolized by the enzyme monoamine oxidase. In foods, it is often produced by the decarboxylation of tyrosine during fermentation or decay. Foods containing considerable amounts of tyramine include fish, chocolate, alcoholic beverages, cheese, soy sauce, sauerkraut, and processed meat. A large dietary intake of tyramine can cause an increase in systolic blood pressure of 30 mmHg or more. Tyramine acts as a neurotransmitter via a G protein-coupled receptor with high affinity for tyramine called TA1. The TA1 receptor is found in the brain as well as peripheral tissues including the kidney. An indirect sympathomimetic, Tyramine can also serve as a substrate for adrenergic uptake systems and monoamine oxidase so it prolongs the actions of adrenergic transmitters. It also provokes transmitter release from adrenergic terminals.

tyr_L,60-18-4,17895,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Tyrosine is an essential amino acid that readily passes the blood-brain barrier. Once in the brain, it is a precursor for the neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine, better known as adrenalin. These neurotransmitters are an important part of the body's sympathetic nervous system, and their concentrations in the body and brain are directly dependent upon dietary tyrosine. Tyrosine is not found in large concentrations throughout the body, probably because it is rapidly metabolized. Folic acid, copper and vitamin C are cofactor nutrients of these reactions. Tyrosine is also the precursor for hormones, thyroid, catecholestrogens and the major human pigment, melanin. Tyrosine is an important amino acid in many proteins, peptides and even enkephalins, the body's natural pain reliever. Valine and other branched amino acids, and possibly tryptophan and phenylalanine may reduce tyrosine absorption. A number of genetic errors of tyrosine metabolism occur, such as hawkinsinuria and tyrosinemia I. Most common is the increased amount of tyrosine in the blood of premature infants, which is marked by decreased motor activity, lethargy and poor feeding. Infection and intellectual deficits may occur. Vitamin C supplements reverse the disease. Some adults also develop elevated tyrosine in their blood. This indicates a need for more vitamin C. More tyrosine is needed under stress, and tyrosine supplements prevent the stress-induced depletion of norepinephrine and can cure biochemical depression. However, tyrosine may not be good for psychosis. Many antipsychotic medications apparently function by inhibiting tyrosine metabolism. L-dopa, which is directly used in Parkinson's, is made from tyrosine. Tyrosine, the nutrient, can be used as an adjunct in the treatment of Parkinson's. Peripheral metabolism of tyrosine necessitates large doses of tyrosine, however, compared to L-dopa (http://www.dcnutrition.com).",L-Tyrosine,HMDB0000158,,,C00082,TYR,FDB000446,tyr_L,[H]OC1=C([H])C([H])=C(C([H])=C1[H])C([H])([H])[C@@]([H])(C([O-])=O)[N+]([H])([H])[H],"(-)-alpha-amino-P-Hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid***(2S)-2-amino-3-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid***(S)-(-)-Tyrosine***(S)-2-amino-3-(P-Hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid***(S)-3-(P-Hydroxyphenyl)alanine***(S)-alpha-amino-4-Hydroxybenzenepropanoic acid***(S)-Tyrosine***4-Hydroxy-L-phenylalanine***L-Tyrosin***Tyr***TYROSINE***Y***(-)-a-amino-P-Hydroxyhydrocinnamate***(-)-a-amino-P-Hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid***(-)-alpha-amino-P-Hydroxyhydrocinnamate***(-)-α-amino-P-hydroxyhydrocinnamate***(-)-α-amino-P-hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid***(2S)-2-amino-3-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)propanoate***(S)-2-amino-3-(P-Hydroxyphenyl)propionate***(S)-a-amino-4-Hydroxybenzenepropanoate***(S)-a-amino-4-Hydroxybenzenepropanoic acid***(S)-alpha-amino-4-Hydroxybenzenepropanoate***(S)-α-amino-4-hydroxybenzenepropanoate***(S)-α-amino-4-hydroxybenzenepropanoic acid***(S)-a-amino-4-Hydroxy-benzenepropanoate***(S)-a-amino-4-Hydroxy-benzenepropanoic acid***(S)-alpha-amino-4-Hydroxy-benzenepropanoate***(S)-alpha-amino-4-Hydroxy-benzenepropanoic acid***2-amino-3-(4-Hydroxyphen yl)-2-amino-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propanoate***2-amino-3-(4-Hydroxyphen yl)-2-amino-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propanoic acid***3-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)-L-alanine***Benzenepropanoate***Benzenepropanoic acid***L-P-Tyrosine***P-Tyrosine***L Tyrosine***Tyrosine, L-isomer***Tyrosine, L isomer***Para tyrosine***Para-tyrosine",OUYCCCASQSFEME-QMMMGPOBSA-N,"InChI=1S/C9H11NO3/c10-8(9(12)13)5-6-1-3-7(11)4-2-6/h1-4,8,11H,5,10H2,(H,12,13)/t8-/m0/s1"

UDP-GlcNAc is the donor substrate for modification of nucleocytoplasmic proteins at serine and threonine residues with N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc). Nutrient sensing in mammals is done through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HSP), which produces uridine 5'-diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-Glc-NAc) as its end product. Mammals respond to nutrient excess by activating O-GlcNAcylation (addition of O-linked N-acetylglucosamine). O-GlcNAc addition (and removal) is key to histone remodeling, transcription, proliferation, apoptosis, and proteasomal degradation. This nutrient-responsive signaling pathway also modulates important cellular pathways, including the insulin signaling cascade in. Alterations in O-GlcNAc metabolism are associated with various human diseases including diabetes mellitus and neurodegeneration. (PMID: 16317114) Due to the chemical makeup of UDP-GlcNAc, it is well positioned to serve as a glucose sensor in that it is a high-energy compound that requires and/or responds to glucose, amino acid, fatty acid and nucleotide metabolism for synthesis. Elevated levels of O-GlcNAc have an effect on insulin-stimulated glucose uptake.

udcpdp,,,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): It is noteworthy that in spite of the similarity of the reactions catalyzed by these prenyltransferases, the modes of expression of catalytic function are surprisingly different, varying according to the chain length and stereochemistry of reaction products. These enzymes are summarized and classified into four groups, as shown in Figure 13. Short-chain prenyl diphosphates synthases such as FPP and GGPP synthases require no cofactor except divalent metal ions, Mg2+ or Mn2+, which are commonly required by all prenyl diphosphate synthases. Medium-chain prenyl diphosphate synthases, including the enzymes for the synthesis of all-E-HexPP and all-E-HepPP, are unusual because they each consist of two dissociable dissimilar protein components, neither of which has catalytic activity. The enzymes for the synthesis of long-chain all-E-prenyl diphosphates, including octaprenyl (C40), nonaprenyl-(C45), and decaprenyl (C50) diphosphates, require polyprenyl carrier proteins that remove polyprenyl products from the active sites of the enzymes to maintain efficient turnovers of catalysis. The enzymes responsible for Z-chain elongation include Z,E-nonaprenyl-(C45) and Z,E-undecaprenyl (C55) diphosphate synthases, which require a phospholipid. The classification of mammalian synthases seems to be fundamentally similar to that of bacterial synthases except that no medium-chain prenyl diphosphate synthases are included. The Z-prenyl diphosphate synthase in mammalian cells is dehydrodolichyl PP synthase, which catalyzes much longer chain elongations than do bacterial enzymes. Dehydrodolichyl PP synthase will be a major target of future studies in this field in view of its involvement in glycoprotein biosynthesis.

udpgal,2956-16-3,67119,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Uridine diphosphategalactose (UDPgal) is a nucleoside diphosphate sugar which can be epimerized into UDPglucose for entry into the mainstream of carbohydrate metabolism. UDPgal is a pivotal compound in the metabolism of galactose. UDPgal is a product of the galactose-l-phosphate uridyl transferase (EC 2.7.7.10) reaction but may also be made from Glucose-l-P, involving uridine diphosphate galactose-4-epimerase (EC 5.1.3.2). UDPgal is the necessary galactosyl donor of galactose in the metabolism to incorporate it into complex oligosaccharides, glycoproteins and glycolipids (galactosides). Defective galactosylation of complex glycoconjugates exists in tissues from galactosemic patients. There is a tendency for galactosemic red cell UDPgal to be in the low normal range with a high uridine diphosphate glucose to UDP-gal ratio. This may reflect an inability of red cell UDPgal-4'-epimerase to maintain a normal ratio and consequently higher levels of UDPgal.

urcan,104-98-3,30817,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Urocanic acid is a breakdown (deamination) product of histidine. In the liver, urocanic acid is an intermediate in the conversion of histidine to glutamic acid, whereas in the epidermis, it accumulates and may be both a UV protectant and an immunoregulator. Urocanic acid (UA) exists as a trans isomer (t-UA, approximately 30 mg/cm2) in the uppermost layer of the skin (stratum corneum). t-UA is formed as the cells of the second layer of skin become metabolically inactive. During this process, proteins and membranes degrade, histidine is released, and histidase (histidine ammonia lyase) catalyzes the deamination of histidine to form t-UA. t-UA accumulates in the epidermis until removal by either the monthly skin renewal cycle or sweat. Upon absorption of UV light, the naturally occurring t-UA isomerizes to its cis form, c-UA. Because DNA lesions (e.g., pyrimidine dimers) in the lower epidermis can result from UV-B absorption, initial research proposed that t-UA acted as a natural sunscreen absorbing UV-B in the stratum corneum before the damaging rays could penetrate into lower epidermal zones.

uri,58-96-8,16704,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Uridine, also known as beta-uridine or 1-beta-D-ribofuranosylpyrimidine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione, is a member of the class of compounds known as pyrimidine nucleosides. Pyrimidine nucleosides are compounds comprising a pyrimidine base attached to a ribosyl or deoxyribosyl moiety. More specifically, uridine is a nucleoside consisting of uracil and D-ribose and a component of RNA. Uridine is soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Uridine can be synthesized from uracil. It is one of the five standard nucleosides which make up nucleic acids, the others being adenosine, thymidine, cytidine and guanosine. The five nucleosides are commonly abbreviated to their one-letter codes U, A, T, C and G respectively. Uridine is also a parent compound for other transformation products, including but not limited to, nikkomycin Z, 3'-(enolpyruvyl)uridine 5'-monophosphate, and 5-aminomethyl-2-thiouridine. Uridine can be found in most biofluids, including urine, breast milk, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and blood. Within the cell, uridine is primarily located in the mitochondria, in the nucleus and the lysosome. It can also be found in the extracellular space. As an essential nucleoside, uridine exists in all living species, ranging from bacteria to humans. In humans, uridine is involved in several metabolic disorders, some of which include dhydropyrimidinase deficiency,  MNGIE (mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy), and beta-ureidopropionase deficiency. Moreover, uridine is found to be associated with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, which is an inborn error of metabolism. Uridine is a nucleoside consisting of uracil and D-ribose and a component of RNA. Uridine plays a role in the glycolysis pathway of galactose. In humans there is no catabolic process to metabolize galactose. Therefore, galactose is converted to glucose and metabolized via the normal glucose metabolism pathways. More specifically, consumed galactose is converted into galactose 1-phosphate (Gal-1-P). This molecule is a substrate for the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase which transfers a UDP molecule to the galactose molecule. The end result is UDP-galactose and glucose-1-phosphate. This process is continued to allow the proper glycolysis of galactose. Uridine is found in many foods (anything containing RNA) but is destroyed in the liver and gastrointestinal tract, and so no food, when consumed, has ever been reliably shown to elevate blood uridine levels. On the other hand, consumption of RNA-rich foods may lead to high levels of purines (adenine and guanosine) in blood. High levels of purines are known to increase uric acid production and may aggravate or lead to conditions such as gout.",Uridine,HMDB0000296,,,C00299,URIDINE,FDB007411,uri,[H]OC([H])([H])[C@@]1([H])O[C@@]([H])(N2C([H])=C([H])C(=O)N([H])C2=O)[C@]([H])(O[H])[C@]1([H])O[H],"1-beta-D-Ribofuranosylpyrimidine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione***1-beta-D-Ribofuranosyluracil***beta-Uridine***u***Urd***Uridin***1-b-D-Ribofuranosylpyrimidine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione***1-β-D-ribofuranosylpyrimidine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione***1-b-D-Ribofuranosyluracil***1-β-D-ribofuranosyluracil***b-Uridine***β-uridine***1-b-D-Ribofuranosyl-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione***1-beta-delta-Ribofuranosyl-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione***1-beta-delta-Ribofuranosyluracil***b-D-Ribofuranoside 2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione-1***beta-delta-Ribofuranoside 2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione-1***allo Uridine***allo-Uridine***Allouridine",DRTQHJPVMGBUCF-XVFCMESISA-N,"InChI=1S/C9H12N2O6/c12-3-4-6(14)7(15)8(17-4)11-2-1-5(13)10-9(11)16/h1-2,4,6-8,12,14-15H,3H2,(H,10,13,16)/t4-,6-,7-,8-/m1/s1"

val_L,72-18-4,16414,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): Valine (abbreviated as Val or V) is an -amino acid with the chemical formula HO2CCH(NH2)CH(CH3)2. It is named after the plant valerian. L-Valine is one of 20 proteinogenic amino acids. Its codons are GUU, GUC, GUA, and GUG. This essential amino acid is classified as nonpolar. Along with leucine and isoleucine, valine is a branched-chain amino acid. Branched chain amino acids (BCAA) are essential amino acids whose carbon structure is marked by a branch point. These three amino acids are critical to human life and are particularly involved in stress, energy and muscle metabolism. BCAA supplementation as therapy, both oral and intravenous, in human health and disease holds great promise. ""BCAA"" denotes valine, isoleucine and leucine which are branched chain essential amino acids. Despite their structural similarities, the branched amino acids have different metabolic routes, with valine going solely to carbohydrates, leucine solely to fats and isoleucine to both. The different metabolism accounts for different requirements for these essential amino acids in humans: 12 mg/kg, 14 mg/kg and 16 mg/kg of valine, leucine and isoleucine respectively. Furthermore, these amino acids have different deficiency symptoms. Valine deficiency is marked by neurological defects in the brain, while isoleucine deficiency is marked by muscle tremors. Many types of inborn errors of BCAA metabolism exist, and are marked by various abnormalities. The most common form is the maple syrup urine disease, marked by a characteristic urinary odor. Other abnormalities are associated with a wide range of symptoms, such as mental retardation, ataxia, hypoglycemia, spinal muscle atrophy, rash, vomiting and excessive muscle movement. Most forms of BCAA metabolism errors are corrected by dietary restriction of BCAA and at least one form is correctable by supplementation with 10 mg of biotin daily. BCAA are decreased in patients with liver disease, such as hepatitis, hepatic coma, cirrhosis, extrahepatic biliary atresia or portacaval shunt; aromatic amino acids (AAA)â€”tyrosine, tryptophan and phenylalanine, as well as methionineâ€”are increased in these conditions. Valine in particular, has been established as a useful supplemental therapy to the ailing liver. All the BCAA probably compete with AAA for absorption into the brain. Supplemental BCAA with vitamin B6 and zinc help normalize the BCAA:AAA ratio (http://www.dcnutrition.com). In sickle-cell disease, valine substitutes for the hydrophilic amino acid glutamic acid in hemoglobin. Because valine is hydrophobic, the hemoglobin does not fold correctly. Hypervalinemia is another example of an inborn error of metabolism involving Valine.

Cytochrome P450 enzymes of the 4A and 4F families catalyze the omega-hydroxylation of arachidonic acid and produce 20-HETE. 20-HETE is a potent constrictor or renal, cerebral and mesenteric arteries. The vasoconstrictor response to 20-HETE is associated with activation of protein kinase, Rho kinase and the mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway C. 20-HETE also increases intracellular Ca2+ by causing the depolarization of vascular smooth muscle membrane secondary to blocking the large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+-channels and by a direct effect on L-type Ca channels. Elevations in the production of 20-HETE mediate the myogenic response of skeletal, renal and cerebral arteries to elevations in transmural pressure. There is an important interaction between nitric oxide (NO) and the formation of 20-HETE production. NO inhibits the formation of 20-HETE formation in renal and cerebral arteries and that a fall in levels of 20-HETE contributes the cyclic GMP-independent dilator effect of NO to activate the large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+-channels and to dilate the cerebral arteries.

xol24oh,474-73-7,34310,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): 24-Hydroxycholesterol (24OHC) is almost exclusively formed in the brain. The enzymatic conversion of CNS cholesterol to 24OHC, which readily crosses the blood-brain barrier, is the major pathway for brain cholesterol elimination and brain cholesterol homeostasis maintenance. The enzyme mediating this conversion has been characterized at the molecular level as cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.13.98, CYP46) and is mainly located in neurons. Like other oxysterols, 24OHC is efficiently converted into normal bile acids or excreted in bile in its sulfated and glucuronidated form. Levels of 24OHC in the circulation decrease with age in infants and children. In adults, however, the levels appear to be stable. There is accumulating evidence pointing toward a potentially important link between cholesterol, beta-amyloid, and Alzheimer's disease. Patients with active demyelinating diseases had increased levels of 24OHC in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Patients with Alzheimer's disease have slightly increased levels of 24OHC in CSF. Patients with multiple sclerosis have a tendency to have higher levels of 24OHC during active periods.

xol27oh,20380-11-4,387060,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): 27-hydroxycholesterol is an oxygenated derivative of cholesterol and a major oxysterol in circulation. 27-hydroxycholesterol is the product of the enzyme sterol 27-hydroxylase. The enzyme is critical for degradation of the steroid side-chain and a genetic deficiency of the enzyme leads to reduced formation of bile acids in humans. There is a correlation between 27-hydroxycholesterol and cholesterol in the circulation, and females have lower levels of 27-hydroxycholesterol than males. A strong correlation is observed between circulating levels of 27-hydroxycholesterol and cholesterol, in both healthy subjects and subjects with hypercholesterolemia and documented atherosclerosis. 27-hydroxycholesterol is metabolized by an oxysterol 7a-hydroxylase in the liver, and changes in the activity of this enzyme may lead to accumulation of 27-hydroxycholesterol in the circulation. It has been reported that patients with a genetic deficiency of oxysterol 7a-hydroxylase in the liver had markedly increased levels of 27-hydroxycholesterol in the circulation. Under normal conditions, however, and in the absence of liver or kidney disease, changes in the levels of 27-hydroxycholesterol in the circulation are likely to be caused by changes in the rate of synthesis of these steroids rather than by the rate of metabolism. Three possible explanations for the high concentrations of 27-hydroxycholesterol found in the circulation of the three subjects with atherosclerosis could be: 1) Increased expression of sterol 27-hydroxylase owing to a genetic factor or some other factor completely unrelated to atherosclerosis. 2) The extrahepatic sterol 27-hydroxylase may be up-regulated by circulating factors (e.g. cytokines) that are directly or indirectly related to the development of atherosclerosis. 3) The high amounts of cholesterol accumulating in macrophages in some patients with atherosclerosis may result in increased flux of 27-hydroxycholesterol from the macrophages to the circulation. Since there is a close relation between levels of cholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol in the circulation, the possibility must be considered that the flux of 27-hydroxycholesterol into the brain may be part of the yet unexplained link between hypercholesterolemia and Alzheimer's disease. 27-hydroxysterol is the most dominant oxysterol in human ateromas where it may reflect a mechanism for eliminating excessive cholesterol and thus have a protective role. Hypercholesterolemia and chronic low-grade immunological activation are pivotal in the development of atherosclerosis. However, the interconnections between these two factors are not well known. The CD40 system, as measured by the plasma level of soluble CD40 (sCD40), is associated with cholesterol metabolism in hypercholesterolemic patients. When combined, a decreased cholesterol synthesis rate and increased levels of 27-hydroxycholesterol may be a consequence of high levels of cellular cholesterol and, therefore, be related to sCD40. However, sCD40 had no significant correlation with total plasma cholesterol. This suggests that the cellular cholesterol synthesis rate and 27-hydroxycholesterol production are more importantly linked with the plasma levels of sCD40 than total cholesterol.

Bile acids are steroid acids found predominantly in bile of mammals. The distinction between different bile acids is minute, depends only on presence or absence of hydroxyl groups on positions 3, 7, and 12. Bile acids are physiological detergents that facilitate excretion, absorption, and transport of fats and sterols in the intestine and liver. Bile acids are also steroidal amphipathic molecules derived from the catabolism of cholesterol. They modulate bile flow and lipid secretion, are essential for the absorption of dietary fats and vitamins, and have been implicated in the regulation of all the key enzymes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Bile acids recirculate through the liver, bile ducts, small intestine and portal vein to form an enterohepatic circuit. They exist as anions at physiological pH and, consequently, require a carrier for transport across the membranes of the enterohepatic tissues. The unique detergent properties of bile acids are essential for the digestion and intestinal absorption of hydrophobic nutrients. Bile acids have potent toxic properties (e.g., membrane disruption) and there are a plethora of mechanisms to limit their accumulation in blood and tissues.

xolest183_hs,,88756,"Human Metabolome Database (HMDB): CE(18:3(6Z,9Z,12Z)) is a cholesterol fatty acid ester or simply a cholesterol ester (CE). Cholesterol esters are cholesterol molecules with long-chain fatty acids linked to the hydroxyl group. They are much less polar than free cholesterol and appear to be the preferred form for transport in plasma and for storage. Cholesterol esters do not contribute to membranes but are packed into intracellular lipid particles or lipoprotein particles. Because of the mechanism of synthesis, plasma cholesterol esters tend to contain relatively high proportions of C18 fatty acids. Cholesterol esters are major constituents of the adrenal glands and they also accumulate in the fatty lesions of atherosclerotic plaques. Cholesterol esters are also major constituents of the lipoprotein particles carried in blood (HDL, LDL, VLDL). The cholesterol esters in high-density lipoproteins (HDL) are synthesized largely by transfer of fatty acids to cholesterol from position sn-2 (or C-2) of phosphatidylcholine catalyzed by the enzyme lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT). The enzyme also promotes the transfer of cholesterol from cells to HDL. As cholesterol esters accumulate in the lipoprotein core, cholesterol is removed from its surface thus promoting the flow of cholesterol from cell membranes into HDL. This in turn leads to morphological changes in HDL, which grow and become spherical. Subsequently, cholesterol esters are transferred to the other lipoprotein fractions LDL and VLDL, a reaction catalyzed by cholesteryl ester transfer protein. Another enzyme, acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) synthesizes cholesterol esters from CoA esters of fatty acids and cholesterol. Cholesterol ester hydrolases liberate cholesterol and free fatty acids when required for membrane and lipoprotein formation, and they also provide cholesterol for hormone synthesis in adrenal cells.","CE(18:3(6Z,9Z,12Z))",HMDB0010369,,,,,FDB027521,xolest183_hs,[H]\C(=C(/[H])C([H])([H])C(\[H])=C(\[H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])[H])C([H])([H])C(\[H])=C(\[H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C(=O)O[C@]1([H])C([H])([H])C2=C([H])C([H])([H])C3([H])C4([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([C@]([H])(C([H])([H])[H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])(C([H])([H])[H])C([H])([H])[H])[C@@]4(C([H])([H])[H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C3([H])[C@@]2(C([H])([H])[H])C([H])([H])C1([H])[H],"1-g-Linolenoyl-cholesterol***1-gamma-Linolenoyl-cholesterol***18:3(6Z,9Z,12Z) Cholesterol ester***CE(18:3)***CE(18:3/0:0)***CE(18:3n6/0:0)***CE(18:3W6/0:0)***Cholesterol 1-(6Z,9Z,12Z-octadecatrienoate***Cholesterol 1-(6Z,9Z,12Z-octadecatrienoate)***Cholesterol 1-(6Z,9Z,12Z-octadecatrienoic acid***Cholesterol 1-(6Z,9Z,12Z-octadecatrienoic acid)***Cholesterol 1-g-linolenoate***Cholesterol 1-g-linolenoic acid***Cholesterol 1-gamma-linolenoate***Cholesterol 1-gamma-linolenoic acid***Cholesterol ester(18:3)***Cholesterol ester(18:3/0:0)***Cholesterol ester(18:3n6/0:0)***Cholesterol ester(18:3W6/0:0)***Cholesteryl 1-(6Z,9Z,12Z-octadecatrienoate***Cholesteryl 1-(6Z,9Z,12Z-octadecatrienoate)***Cholesteryl 1-(6Z,9Z,12Z-octadecatrienoic acid***Cholesteryl 1-(6Z,9Z,12Z-octadecatrienoic acid)***Cholesteryl 1-g-linolenoate***Cholesteryl 1-g-linolenoic acid***Cholesteryl 1-gamma-linolenoate***Cholesteryl 1-gamma-linolenoic acid***CE(18:3(6Z,9Z,12Z))***1-(6Z,9Z,12Z-octadecatrienoyl)-cholesterol",GOHHVMNZYOLIPQ-GHOVPUJYSA-N,"InChI=1S/C45H74O2/c1-7-8-9-10-11-12-13-14-15-16-17-18-19-20-21-25-43(46)47-38-30-32-44(5)37(34-38)26-27-39-41-29-28-40(36(4)24-22-23-35(2)3)45(41,6)33-31-42(39)44/h11-12,14-15,17-18,26,35-36,38-42H,7-10,13,16,19-25,27-34H2,1-6H3/t36-,38+,39?,40?,41?,42?,44+,45-/m1/s1"

It has chemical formula C5H10O5 and is 40% as sweet as sucrose. Xylose is found in the embryos of most edible plants. The polysaccharide xylan, which is closely associated with cellulose, consists practically entirely of d-xylose. Corncobs, cottonseed hulls, pecan shells, and straw contain considerable amounts of this sugar. Xylose is also found in mucopolysaccharides of connective tissue and sometimes in the urine. Xylose is the first sugar added to serine or threonine residues during proteoglycan type O-glycosylation. Therefore xylose is involved in the biosythetic pathways of most anionic polysaccharides such as heparan sulphate and chondroitin sulphate. In medicine, xylose is used to test for malabsorption by administering a xylose solution to the patient after fasting. If xylose is detected in the blood and/or urine within the next few hours, it has been absorbed by the intestines. Xylose is said to be one of eight sugars which are essential for human nutrition, the others being galactose, glucose, mannose, N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetylgalactosamine, fucose, and sialic acid.

It is an intermediate in the pentose and glucuronate interconversion pathway and can be formed from either D-xylonic acid or D-xylose. D-xylose is a simple 5 carbon sugar that is found in a variety of edible plants. It is also frequently used in intestinal absorption tests to help diagnose problems that prevent the small intestine from absorbing nutrients in food. Xylose is also the first saccharide added to the serine or threonine in the proteoglycan type O-glycosylation and so it is the first saccharide in biosynthetic pathways of most anionic polysaccharides such as heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate. D-xylose is normally easily absorbed by the intestines where it can be converted to D-xylonolactone by intestinal D-xylose 1-dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.175).,D-Xylonolactone,HMDB0011676,,,,,,,,,,

Xylitol is used as a diabetic sweetener which is roughly as sweet as sucrose with 33% fewer calories. Xylitol is naturally found in many fruits (strawberries, plums, raspberries) and vegetables (e.g. cauliflower). Because of fruit and vegetable consumption the human body naturally processes 15 grams of xylitol per day. Xylitol can be produced industrially starting from primary matters rich in xylan which is hydrolyzed to obtain xylose. It is extracted from hemicelluloses present in the corn raids, the almond hulls or the barks of birch (or of the by-products of wood: shavings hard, paper pulp). Of all polyols, it is the one that has the sweetest flavor (it borders that of saccharose). It gives a strong refreshing impression, making xylitol an ingredient of choice for the sugarless chewing gum industry. In addition to his use in confectionery, it is used in the pharmaceutical industry for certain mouthwashes and toothpastes and in cosmetics (creams, soaps, etc.). Xylitol is produced starting from xylose, the isomaltose, by enzymatic transposition of the saccharose (sugar). Xylitol is not metabolized by cariogenic (cavity-causing) bacteria and gum chewing stimulates the flow of saliva; as a result, chewing xylitol gum may prevent dental caries. Chewing xylitol gum for 4 to 14 days reduces the amount of dental plaque. The reduction in the amount of plaque following xylitol gum chewing within 2 weeks may be a transient phenomenon. Chewing xylitol gum for 6 months reduced mutans streptococci levels in saliva and plaque in adults (PMID: 17426399 , 15964535 ). Studies have also shown xylitol chewing gum can help prevent acute otitis media (ear aches and infections) as the act of chewing and swallowing assists with the disposal of earwax and clearing the middle ear, while the presence of xylitol prevents the growth of bacteria in the eustachian tubes. Xylitol is well established as a life-threatening toxin to dogs. The number of reported cases of xylitol toxicosis in dogs has significantly increased since the first reports in 2002. Dogs that have ingested foods containing xylitol (greater than 100 milligrams of xylitol consumed per kilogram of bodyweight) have presented with low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), which can be life-threatening.

It is estimated that 3000 of the hundreds of thousands of proteins in the human body contain zinc prosthetic groups. In addition, there are over a dozen types of cells in the human body that secrete zinc ions, and the roles of these secreted zinc signals in medicine and health are now being actively studied. Intriguingly, brain cells in the mammalian forebrain are one type of cell that secretes zinc, along with its other neuronal messenger substances. Cells in the salivary gland, prostate, immune system and intestine are other types that secrete zinc. Obtaining a sufficient zinc intake during pregnancy and in young children is a problem, especially among those who cannot afford a good and varied diet. Brain development is stunted by zinc deficiency in utero and in youth. Zinc is an activator of certain enzymes, such as carbonic anhydrase. Carbonic anhydrase is important in the transport of carbon dioxide in vertebrate blood. Even though zinc is an essential requirement for a healthy body, too much zinc can be harmful. Excessive absorption of zinc can also suppress copper and iron absorption. The free zinc ion in solution is highly toxic to plants, invertebrates, and even vertebrate fish.
