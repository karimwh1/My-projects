The average adult ingests 3 to 5 grams of glycine daily. Glycine is involved in the body's production of DNA, phospholipids and collagen, and in release of energy. Glycine levels are effectively measured in plasma in both normal patients and those with inborn errors of glycine metabolism (http://www.dcnutrition.com/AminoAcids/). Nonketotic hyperglycinaemia (OMIM 606899) is an autosomal recessive condition caused by deficient enzyme activity of the glycine cleavage enzyme system (EC 2.1.1.10). The glycine cleavage enzyme system comprises four proteins: P-, T-, H- and L-proteins (EC 1.4.4.2, EC 2.1.2.10 and EC 1.8.1.4 for P-, T- and L-proteins). Mutations have been described in the GLDC (OMIM 238300), AMT (OMIM 238310), and GCSH (OMIM 238330) genes encoding the P-, T-, and H-proteins respectively. The glycine cleavage system catalyses the oxidative conversion of glycine into carbon dioxide and ammonia, with the remaining one-carbon unit transferred to folate as methylenetetrahydrofolate. It is the main catabolic pathway for glycine and it also contributes to one-carbon metabolism. Patients with a deficiency of this enzyme system have increased glycine in plasma, urine and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with an increased CSF: plasma glycine ratio (PMID 16151895). Glycine is also found to be associated with carbamoyl phosphate synthetase deficiency, iminoglycinuria, maple syrup urine disease, phenylketonuria, propionic acidemia, sarcosinemia, and tyrosinemia I, which are inborn errors of metabolism.","Aminoacetic acid***Aminoessigsaeure***Aminoethanoic acid***G***Gly***Glycin***Glycocoll***Glykokoll***Glyzin***H2N-CH2-COOH***Hgly***Leimzucker***Aminoacetate***Aminoethanoate***2-Aminoacetate***2-Aminoacetic acid***Aciport***amino-Acetate***amino-Acetic acid***Glicoamin***Glycolixir***Glycosthene***Gyn-hydralin***Padil***Glycine carbonate (1:1), monosodium salt***Glycine carbonate (2:1), monopotassium salt***Glycine sulfate (3:1)***Glycine, monoammonium salt***Glycine, monosodium salt***Glycine, sodium hydrogen carbonate***Monoammonium salt glycine***Calcium salt glycine***Glycine hydrochloride (2:1)***Glycine phosphate (1:1)***Glycine, monopotasssium salt***Monopotasssium salt glycine***Monosodium salt glycine***Glycine carbonate (2:1), monolithium salt***Glycine carbonate (2:1), monosodium salt***Glycine hydrochloride***Glycine, copper salt***Hydrochloride, glycine***Salt glycine, monoammonium***Acid, aminoacetic***Cobalt salt glycine***Copper salt glycine***Glycine phosphate***Glycine, calcium salt***Glycine, calcium salt (2:1)***Glycine, cobalt salt***Phosphate, glycine***Salt glycine, monosodium",Glycine,,C2H5NO2,0,75.0666,75.03202841,http://identifiers.org/vmhmetabolite/gly,gly,,,HC00045,C00037,750.0,15428.0,CHEMBL773,"InChI=1S/C2H5NO2/c3-1-2(4)5/h1,3H2,(H,4,5)",DHMQDGOQFOQNFH-UHFFFAOYSA-N,[H][N+]([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([O-])=O,HMDB0000123,MNXM29,cpd00033,glycine,gly,gly,,,gly,,gly,,FDB000484,730.0,GLY,Glycine,DB00145,C00001361,1062.0,20.0,56-40-6,DTXSID9020667,100.000.248,727.0,TE7660XO1C,D005998,gly,True,True,2018-05-31T15:53:21.702280Z,2018-09-24T15:08:53.357771Z,NKH,Glycine Encephalopathy/ Nonketotic Hyperglycinemia,Inherited metabolic disorder,Amino acid disorders,Autosomal recessive,605899,605899,605899.0,,"1) Neonatal (classic) presentation-The neonatal form of glycine encephalopathy manifests in the first hours to days of life with progressive lethargy, hypotonia, and myoclonic jerks leading to apnea and often death if not supported by intubation and ventilation.  2) Infantile presentation- These infants do not have lethargy and coma in the neonatal period, but often have a history of hypotonia from early on.

Proline is sometimes called an imino acid, although the IUPAC definition of an imine requires a carbon-nitrogen double bond. Proline is a non-essential amino acid that is synthesized from glutamic acid. It is an essential component of collagen and is important for proper functioning of joints and tendons. Proline is derived from the amino acid L-glutamate in which glutamate-5-semialdehyde is first formed by glutamate 5-kinase and glutamate-5-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (which requires NADH or NADPH). This semialdehyde can then either spontaneously cyclize to form 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylic acid, which is reduced to proline by pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase, or turned into ornithine by ornithine aminotransferase, followed by cyclization by ornithine cyclodeaminase to form proline. L-Proline has been found to act as a weak agonist of the glycine receptor and of both NMDA and non-NMDA ionotropic glutamate receptors. It has been proposed to be a potential endogenous excitotoxin/neurotoxin. Studies in rats have shown that when injected into the brain, proline non-selectively destroys pyramidal and granule cells (PMID: 3409032). Therefore, under certain conditions proline can act as a neurotoxin and a metabotoxin. A neurotoxin causes damage to nerve cells and nerve tissues. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of proline are associated with at least five inborn errors of metabolism, including hyperprolinemia type I, hyperprolinemia type II, iminoglycinuria, prolinemia type II, and pyruvate carboxylase deficiency. People with hyperprolinemia type I often do not show any symptoms even though they have proline levels in their blood between 3 and 10 times the normal level. Some individuals with hyperprolinemia type I exhibit seizures, intellectual disability, or other neurological or psychiatric problems. Hyperprolinemia type II results in proline levels in the blood between 10 and 15 times higher than normal, and high levels of a related compound called pyrroline-5-carboxylate. Hyperprolinemia type II has signs and symptoms that vary in severity, and is more likely than type I to involve seizures or intellectual disability.",(-)-(S)-Proline***(-)-2-Pyrrolidinecarboxylic acid***(-)-Proline***(2S)-Pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid***(S)-2-Carboxypyrrolidine***(S)-2-Pyrrolidinecarboxylic acid***(S)-Pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid***2-Pyrrolidinecarboxylic acid***L-(-)-Proline***L-alpha-Pyrrolidinecarboxylic acid***L-Prolin***L-Pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid***P***Prolina***PROLINE***Prolinum***(-)-2-Pyrrolidinecarboxylate***(2S)-Pyrrolidine-2-carboxylate***(S)-2-Pyrrolidinecarboxylate***(S)-Pyrrolidine-2-carboxylate***2-Pyrrolidinecarboxylate***L-a-Pyrrolidinecarboxylate***L-a-Pyrrolidinecarboxylic acid***L-alpha-Pyrrolidinecarboxylate***L-α-pyrrolidinecarboxylate***L-α-pyrrolidinecarboxylic acid***L-Pyrrolidine-2-carboxylate***(S)-(-)-Proline***(S)-(-)-Pyrrolidine-2-carboxylate***(S)-(-)-Pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid***(S)-2-Pyrralidinecarboxylate***(S)-2-Pyrralidinecarboxylic acid***(S)-Proline***L Proline,L-Proline,,C5H9NO2,0,115.1305,115.0633285,http://identifiers.org/vmhmetabolite/pro_L,pro__L,,,HC00145,C00148,145742.0,17203.0,,"InChI=1S/C5H9NO2/c7-5(8)4-2-1-3-6-4/h4,6H,1-3H2,(H,7,8)/t4-/m0/s1",ONIBWKKTOPOVIA-BYPYZUCNSA-N,[H]C1([H])C([H])([H])[N+]([H])([H])[C@]([H])(C([O-])=O)C1([H])[H],HMDB0000162,MNXM114,cpd00129,,pro_L,pro_L,,,pro_L,,,,FDB000570,128566.0,PRO,L-Proline,DBMET00494,C00001388,,29.0,147-85-3,DTXSID5044021,,,,,pro_L,True,True,2018-05-31T15:53:21.702280Z,2018-09-24T15:08:41.796815Z,GACR,Gyrate Atrophy of the Choroid And Retina,Inherited metabolic disorder,Amino acid disorders,Autosomal recessive,258870,258870,258870.0,258870.0,,150 cases,"Muscle, eye",http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/gyrate-atrophy-of-the-choroid-and-retina,gyrate-atrophy-of-the-choroid-and-retina,414.0,Ornithine_aminotransferase_deficiency,GYRATE%20ATROPHY%20OF%20CHOROID%20AND%20RETINA,3349.0,5411.0,6556.0,,OAT,ENSG00000065154,OAT,OAT,OAT,613349,OAT,gyrate_atrophy_of_choroid_and_retina,258870.0,"Decreased activity of ornithine-delta-aminotransferase in fibroblast.

It is named after the plant valerian. L-Valine is one of 20 proteinogenic amino acids. Its codons are GUU, GUC, GUA, and GUG. This essential amino acid is classified as nonpolar. Along with leucine and isoleucine, valine is a branched-chain amino acid. Branched chain amino acids (BCAA) are essential amino acids whose carbon structure is marked by a branch point. These three amino acids are critical to human life and are particularly involved in stress, energy and muscle metabolism. BCAA supplementation as therapy, both oral and intravenous, in human health and disease holds great promise. ""BCAA"" denotes valine, isoleucine and leucine which are branched chain essential amino acids. Despite their structural similarities, the branched amino acids have different metabolic routes, with valine going solely to carbohydrates, leucine solely to fats and isoleucine to both. The different metabolism accounts for different requirements for these essential amino acids in humans: 12 mg/kg, 14 mg/kg and 16 mg/kg of valine, leucine and isoleucine respectively. Furthermore, these amino acids have different deficiency symptoms. Valine deficiency is marked by neurological defects in the brain, while isoleucine deficiency is marked by muscle tremors. Many types of inborn errors of BCAA metabolism exist, and are marked by various abnormalities. The most common form is the maple syrup urine disease, marked by a characteristic urinary odor. Other abnormalities are associated with a wide range of symptoms, such as mental retardation, ataxia, hypoglycemia, spinal muscle atrophy, rash, vomiting and excessive muscle movement. Most forms of BCAA metabolism errors are corrected by dietary restriction of BCAA and at least one form is correctable by supplementation with 10 mg of biotin daily. BCAA are decreased in patients with liver disease, such as hepatitis, hepatic coma, cirrhosis, extrahepatic biliary atresia or portacaval shunt; aromatic amino acids (AAA)â€”tyrosine, tryptophan and phenylalanine, as well as methionineâ€”are increased in these conditions. Valine in particular, has been established as a useful supplemental therapy to the ailing liver. All the BCAA probably compete with AAA for absorption into the brain. Supplemental BCAA with vitamin B6 and zinc help normalize the BCAA:AAA ratio (http://www.dcnutrition.com). In sickle-cell disease, valine substitutes for the hydrophilic amino acid glutamic acid in hemoglobin. Because valine is hydrophobic, the hemoglobin does not fold correctly.

It is abundant in human plasma, particularly in newborns. Severe deficiency of threonine causes neurological dysfunction and lameness in experimental animals. Threonine is an immunostimulant which promotes the growth of thymus gland. It also can probably promote cell immune defense function. This amino acid has been useful in the treatment of genetic spasticity disorders and multiple sclerosis at a dose of 1 gram daily. It is highly concentrated in meat products, cottage cheese and wheat germ. (http://www.dcnutrition.com/AminoAcids/) The threonine content of most of the infant formulas currently on the market is approximately 20% higher than the threonine concentration in human milk. Due to this high threonine content the plasma threonine concentrations are up to twice as high in premature infants fed these formulas than in infants fed human milk. The whey proteins which are used for infant formulas are sweet whey proteins. Sweet whey results from cheese production. Threonine catabolism in mammals appears to be due primarily (70-80%) to the activity of threonine dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.103) that oxidizes threonine to 2-amino-3-oxobutyrate, which forms glycine and acetyl CoA, whereas threonine dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.16) that catabolizes threonine into 2-oxobutyrate and ammonia, is significantly less active. Increasing the threonine plasma concentrations leads to accumulation of threonine and glycine in the brain. Such accumulation affects the neurotransmitter balance which may have consequences for the brain development during early postnatal life. Thus, excessive threonine intake during infant feeding should be avoided.

In addition to being a substrate for protein synthesis, it is an intermediate in transmethylation reactions, serving as the major methyl group donor in vivo, including the methyl groups for DNA and RNA intermediates. Methionine is a methyl acceptor for 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase (methionine synthase), the only reaction that allows for the recycling of this form of folate, and is also a methyl acceptor for the catabolism of betaine. Methionine is the metabolic precursor for cysteine. Only the sulfur atom from methionine is transferred to cysteine; the carbon skeleton of cysteine is donated by serine (PMID: 16702340). There is a general consensus concerning normal sulfur amino acid (SAA) requirements. WHO recommendations amount to 13 mg/kg per 24 h in healthy adults. This amount is roughly doubled in artificial nutrition regimens. In disease or after trauma, requirements may be altered for methionine, cysteine, and taurine. Although in specific cases of congenital enzyme deficiency, prematurity, or diminished liver function, hypermethioninemia or hyperhomocysteinemia may occur, SAA supplementation can be considered safe in amounts exceeding 2-3 times the minimum recommended daily intake. Apart from some very specific indications (e.g. acetaminophen poisoning) the usefulness of SAA supplementation is not yet established (PMID: 16702341). Methionine is known to exacerbate psychopathological symptoms in schizophrenic patients, but there is no evidence of similar effects in healthy subjects. The role of methionine as a precursor of homocysteine is the most notable cause for concern. Acute doses of methionine can lead to acute increases in plasma homocysteine, which can be used as an index of the susceptibility to cardiovascular disease. Sufficiently high doses of methionine can actually result in death. Longer-term studies in adults have indicated no adverse consequences of moderate fluctuations in dietary methionine intake, but intakes higher than 5 times the normal amount resulted in elevated homocysteine levels. These effects of methionine on homocysteine and vascular function are moderated by supplements of vitamins B-6, B-12, C, and folic acid (PMID: 16702346). When present in sufficiently high levels, methionine can act as an atherogen and a metabotoxin. An atherogen is a compound that when present at chronically high levels causes atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of methionine are associated with at least ten inborn errors of metabolism, including cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency, glycine N-methyltransferase deficiency, homocystinuria, tyrosinemia, galactosemia, homocystinuria-megaloblastic anemia due to defects in cobalamin metabolism, methionine adenosyltransferase deficiency, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency, and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) hydrolase deficiency. Chronically elevated levels of methionine in infants can lead to intellectual disability and other neurological problems, delays in motor skills, sluggishness, muscle weakness, and liver problems. Many individuals with these metabolic disorders tend to develop cardiovascular disease later in life. Studies on feeding rodents high levels of methionine have shown that methionine promotes atherosclerotic plaques independently of homocysteine levels (PMID: 26647293). A similar study in Finnish men showed the same effect (PMID: 16487911).","(2S)-2-amino-4-(Methylsulfanyl)butanoic acid***(S)-2-amino-4-(methylthio)Butanoic acid***(S)-2-amino-4-(methylthio)Butyric acid***(S)-Methionine***L-(-)-Methionine***L-alpha-amino-gamma-Methylmercaptobutyric acid***L-Methionin***M***Met***METHIONINE***(2S)-2-amino-4-(Methylsulfanyl)butanoate***(2S)-2-amino-4-(Methylsulphanyl)butanoate***(2S)-2-amino-4-(Methylsulphanyl)butanoic acid***(S)-2-amino-4-(methylthio)Butanoate***(S)-2-amino-4-(methylthio)Butyrate***L-a-amino-g-Methylmercaptobutyrate***L-a-amino-g-Methylmercaptobutyric acid***L-alpha-amino-gamma-Methylmercaptobutyrate***L-α-amino-γ-methylmercaptobutyrate***L-α-amino-γ-methylmercaptobutyric acid***(L)-Methionine***(S)-(+)-Methionine***(S)-2-amino-4-(methylthio)-Butanoate***(S)-2-amino-4-(methylthio)-Butanoic acid***2-amino-4-(methylthio)Butyrate***2-amino-4-(methylthio)Butyric acid***2-amino-4-Methylthiobutanoate***2-amino-4-Methylthiobutanoic acid***a-amino-g-Methylmercaptobutyrate***a-amino-g-Methylmercaptobutyric acid***Acimethin***alpha-amino-alpha-Aminobutyric acid***alpha-amino-gamma-Methylmercaptobutyrate***alpha-amino-gamma-Methylmercaptobutyric acid***Cymethion***g-methylthio-a-Aminobutyrate***g-methylthio-a-Aminobutyric acid***gamma-methylthio-alpha-Aminobutyrate***gamma-methylthio-alpha-Aminobutyric acid***H-Met-H***H-Met-OH***L(-)-amino-alpha-amino-alpha-Aminobutyric acid***L(-)-amino-gamma-Methylthiobutyric acid***L-2-amino-4-(methylthio)Butyric acid***L-2-amino-4-Methylthiobutyric acid***L-a-amino-g-Methylthiobutyrate***L-a-amino-g-Methylthiobutyric acid***L-alpha-amino-gamma-Methylthiobutyrate***L-alpha-amino-gamma-Methylthiobutyric acid***L-gamma-methylthio-alpha-Aminobutyric acid***L-Methioninum***Liquimeth***Mepron***Methilanin***Methioninum***Metionina***neo-Methidin***Poly-L-methionine***Polymethionine***S-Methionine***S-Methyl-L-homocysteine***Toxin war***L-Isomer methionine***Methionine, L-isomer***Pedameth***Methionine, L isomer",L-Methionine,,C5H11NO2S,0,149.211,149.0510493,http://identifiers.org/vmhmetabolite/met_L,met__L,,,HC00075,C00073,6137.0,16643.0,,"InChI=1S/C5H11NO2S/c1-9-3-2-4(6)5(7)8/h4H,2-3,6H2,1H3,(H,7,8)/t4-/m0/s1",FFEARJCKVFRZRR-BYPYZUCNSA-N,[H]C([H])([H])SC([H])([H])C([H])([H])[C@@]([H])(C([O-])=O)[N+]([H])([H])[H],HMDB0000696,MNXM61,cpd00060,,met_L,met_L,,,met_L,,,,FDB012683,5907.0,MET,MET,DBMET00506,C00001379,,5664.0,63-68-3,DTXSID5040548,,,,,met_L,True,True,2018-05-31T15:53:21.702280Z,2018-09-24T15:08:54.536390Z,HMET,Hypermethioninemia,Inherited metabolic disorder,Amino acid disorders,Autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant,613752,,,,,Only a small number of cases have been reported.many individuals with hypermethioninemia have no symptoms,"Nervous system,  liver,  muscle","PMID: 16702333, http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/hypermethioninemia",hypermethioninemia,88618.0,Hypermethioninemia,HYPERMETHIONINEMIA%20WITH%20S-ADENOSYLHOMOCYSTEINE%20HYDROLASE%20DEFICIENCY,11805.0,8595.0,,,AHCY,ENSG00000101444,AHCY,AHCY,AHCY,180960,AHCY,hypermethioninemia,613752.0,"A deficiency of any of these enzymes (i.e. MAT1A gene provides instructions for producing the enzyme methionine adenosyltransferase, GNMT gene provides instructions for making the enzyme glycine N-methyltransferase, AHCY gene provides instructions for producing the enzyme S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase) results in a build-up of methionine in the body, and may cause signs and symptoms related to hypermethioninemia.

In addition to being a substrate for protein synthesis, it is an intermediate in transmethylation reactions, serving as the major methyl group donor in vivo, including the methyl groups for DNA and RNA intermediates. Methionine is a methyl acceptor for 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase (methionine synthase), the only reaction that allows for the recycling of this form of folate, and is also a methyl acceptor for the catabolism of betaine. Methionine is the metabolic precursor for cysteine. Only the sulfur atom from methionine is transferred to cysteine; the carbon skeleton of cysteine is donated by serine (PMID: 16702340). There is a general consensus concerning normal sulfur amino acid (SAA) requirements. WHO recommendations amount to 13 mg/kg per 24 h in healthy adults. This amount is roughly doubled in artificial nutrition regimens. In disease or after trauma, requirements may be altered for methionine, cysteine, and taurine. Although in specific cases of congenital enzyme deficiency, prematurity, or diminished liver function, hypermethioninemia or hyperhomocysteinemia may occur, SAA supplementation can be considered safe in amounts exceeding 2-3 times the minimum recommended daily intake. Apart from some very specific indications (e.g. acetaminophen poisoning) the usefulness of SAA supplementation is not yet established (PMID: 16702341). Methionine is known to exacerbate psychopathological symptoms in schizophrenic patients, but there is no evidence of similar effects in healthy subjects. The role of methionine as a precursor of homocysteine is the most notable cause for concern. Acute doses of methionine can lead to acute increases in plasma homocysteine, which can be used as an index of the susceptibility to cardiovascular disease. Sufficiently high doses of methionine can actually result in death. Longer-term studies in adults have indicated no adverse consequences of moderate fluctuations in dietary methionine intake, but intakes higher than 5 times the normal amount resulted in elevated homocysteine levels. These effects of methionine on homocysteine and vascular function are moderated by supplements of vitamins B-6, B-12, C, and folic acid (PMID: 16702346). When present in sufficiently high levels, methionine can act as an atherogen and a metabotoxin.

Like tyrosine, phenylalanine is also a precursor for catecholamines including tyramine, dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. Catecholamines are neurotransmitters that act as adrenalin-like substances. Interestingly, several psychotropic drugs (mescaline, morphine, codeine, and papaverine) also have phenylalanine as a constituent. Phenylalanine is highly concentrated in the human brain and plasma. Normal metabolism of phenylalanine requires biopterin, iron, niacin, vitamin B6, copper, and vitamin C. An average adult ingests 5 g of phenylalanine per day and may optimally need up to 8 g daily. Phenylalanine is highly concentrated in a number of high protein foods, such as meat, cottage cheese, and wheat germ. An additional dietary source of phenylalanine is artificial sweeteners containing aspartame. As a general rule, aspartame should be avoided by phenylketonurics and pregnant women. When present in sufficiently high levels, phenylalanine can act as a neurotoxin and a metabotoxin. A neurotoxin is a compound that disrupts or attacks neural cells and neural tissue. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Chronically high levels of phenylalanine are associated with at least five inborn errors of metabolism, including Hartnup disorder, hyperphenylalaninemia due to guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase deficiency, phenylketonuria (PKU), tyrosinemia type 2 (or Richner-Hanhart syndrome), and tyrosinemia type III (TYRO3). Phenylketonurics have elevated serum plasma levels of phenylalanine up to 400 times normal. High plasma concentrations of phenylalanine influence the blood-brain barrier transport of large neutral amino acids. The high plasma phenylalanine concentrations increase phenylalanine entry into the brain and restrict the entry of other large neutral amino acids (PMID: 19191004). Phenylalanine has been found to interfere with different cerebral enzyme systems. Untreated phenylketonuria (PKU) can lead to intellectual disability, seizures, behavioural problems, and mental disorders. It may also result in a musty smell and lighter skin. Classic PKU dramatically affects myelination and white matter tracts in untreated infants; this may be one major cause of neurological disorders associated with phenylketonuria. Mild phenylketonuria can act as an unsuspected cause of hyperactivity, learning problems, and other developmental problems in children. It has been recently suggested that PKU may resemble amyloid diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, due to the formation of toxic amyloid-like assemblies of phenylalanine (PMID: 22706200). Phenylalanine also has some potential benefits. Phenylalanine can act as an effective pain reliever. Its use in premenstrual syndrome and Parkinson's may enhance the effects of acupuncture and electric transcutaneous nerve stimulation (TENS). Phenylalanine and tyrosine, like L-DOPA, produce a catecholamine-like effect. Phenylalanine is better absorbed than tyrosine and may cause fewer headaches. Low phenylalanine diets have been prescribed for certain cancers with mixed results. For instance, some tumours use more phenylalanine than others (particularly melatonin-producing tumours called melanomas).","(S)-2-amino-3-Phenylpropionic acid***(S)-alpha-amino-beta-Phenylpropionic acid***3-Phenyl-L-alanine***beta-Phenyl-L-alanine***F***Phe***PHENYLALANINE***(S)-2-amino-3-Phenylpropionate***(S)-a-amino-b-Phenylpropionate***(S)-a-amino-b-Phenylpropionic acid***(S)-alpha-amino-beta-Phenylpropionate***(S)-α-amino-β-phenylpropionate***(S)-α-amino-β-phenylpropionic acid***b-Phenyl-L-alanine***β-phenyl-L-alanine***(-)-beta-Phenylalanine***(L)-Phenylalanine***(S)-(-)-Phenylalanine***(S)-2-amino-3-Phenylpropanoate***(S)-2-amino-3-Phenylpropanoic acid***(S)-alpha-amino-Benzenepropanoate***(S)-alpha-amino-Benzenepropanoic acid***(S)-alpha-Aminobenzenepropanoate***(S)-alpha-Aminobenzenepropanoic acid***(S)-alpha-Aminohydrocinnamate***(S)-alpha-Aminohydrocinnamic acid***(S)-Phenylalanine***alpha-Aminohydrocinnamate***alpha-Aminohydrocinnamic acid***beta-Phenyl-alpha-alanine***beta-Phenylalanine***L-2-amino-3-Phenylpropionate***L-2-amino-3-Phenylpropionic acid***Phenyl-alanine***Phenylalamine***L-Isomer phenylalanine***Phenylalanine, L isomer***Phenylalanine, L-isomer***Endorphenyl",L-Phenylalanine,,C9H11NO2,0,165.1891,165.0789786,http://identifiers.org/vmhmetabolite/phe_L,phe__L,,,HC00081,C00079,6140.0,17295.0,CHEMBL301523,"InChI=1S/C9H11NO2/c10-8(9(11)12)6-7-4-2-1-3-5-7/h1-5,8H,6,10H2,(H,11,12)/t8-/m0/s1",COLNVLDHVKWLRT-QMMMGPOBSA-N,[H]C1=C([H])C([H])=C(C([H])=C1[H])C([H])([H])[C@@]([H])(C([O-])=O)[N+]([H])([H])[H],HMDB0000159,MNXM97,cpd01400,L-phenylalanine,phe_L,phe_L,,,phe_L,,,,FDB014705,5910.0,PHE,L-Phenylalanine,DB00120,C00001386,,28.0,63-91-2,DTXSID4040763,100.000.517,3313.0,8P946UF12S,,phe_L,True,True,2018-05-31T15:53:21.702280Z,2018-09-24T15:08:43.929164Z,PKU,Phenylketonuria,Inherited metabolic disorder,Amino acid disorders,Autosomal recessive,261600,,,,"Phenylketonuria (PKU), Non-PKU hyperphenylalaninemia (non-PKU HPA), and Variant PKU.

In mammals, arginine is formally classified as a semiessential or conditionally essential amino acid, depending on the developmental stage and health status of the individual. Infants are unable to effectively synthesize arginine, making it nutritionally essential for infants. Adults, however, are able to synthesize arginine in the urea cycle. Arginine can be considered to be a basic amino acid as the part of the side chain nearest to the backbone is long, carbon-containing and hydrophobic, whereas the end of the side chain is a complex guanidinium group. With a pKa of 12.48, the guanidinium group is positively charged in neutral, acidic and even most basic environments. Because of the conjugation between the double bond and the nitrogen lone pairs, the positive charge is delocalized. This group is able to form multiple H-bonds. L-arginine is an amino acid that has numerous functions in the body. It helps dispose of ammonia, is used to make compounds such as nitric oxide, creatine, L-glutamate, L-proline, and it can be converted to glucose and glycogen if needed. In large doses, L-arginine also stimulates the release of hormones, growth hormone and prolactin. Arginine is a known inducer of MTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) and is responsible for inducing protein synthesis through the MTOR pathway. MTOR inhibition by rapamycin partially reduces arginine-induced protein synthesis (PMID: 20841502). Catabolic disease states such as sepsis, injury, and cancer cause an increase in arginine utilization, which can exceed normal body production, leading to arginine depletion. Arginine also activates AMP kinase (AMPK) which then stimulates skeletal muscle fatty acid oxidation and muscle glucose uptake, thereby increasing insulin secretion by pancreatic beta-cells (PMID: 21311355). Moreover, L-arginine is found to be associated with argininemia, cystinuria, hyperdibasic aminoaciduria I, maple syrup urine disease, propionic acidemia, and tyrosinemia I, which are inborn errors of metabolism. Arginine is found in plant and animal proteins, such as dairy products, meat, poultry, fish, and nuts. The ratio of L-arginine to lysine is also important - soy and other plant proteins have more L-arginine than animal sources of protein.","(2S)-2-amino-5-(carbamimidamido)Pentanoic acid***(2S)-2-amino-5-Guanidinopentanoic acid***(S)-2-amino-5-Guanidinopentanoic acid***(S)-2-amino-5-Guanidinovaleric acid***Arg***Arginine***L-(+)-Arginine***L-Arg***L-Arginin***R***(2S)-2-amino-5-(carbamimidamido)Pentanoate***(2S)-2-amino-5-Guanidinopentanoate***(S)-2-amino-5-Guanidinopentanoate***(S)-2-amino-5-Guanidinovalerate***(S)-2-amino-5-[(Aminoiminomethyl)amino]-pentanoate***(S)-2-amino-5-[(Aminoiminomethyl)amino]-pentanoic acid***(S)-2-amino-5-[(Aminoiminomethyl)amino]pentanoate***(S)-2-amino-5-[(Aminoiminomethyl)amino]pentanoic acid***2-amino-5-Guanidinovalerate***2-amino-5-Guanidinovaleric acid***5-[(Aminoiminomethyl)amino]-L-norvaline***L-a-amino-D-Guanidinovalerate***L-a-amino-D-Guanidinovaleric acid***L-alpha-amino-delta-Guanidinovalerate***L-alpha-amino-delta-Guanidinovaleric acid***N5-(Aminoiminomethyl)-L-ornithine***DL-Arginine acetate, monohydrate***L-Isomer arginine***Monohydrate DL-arginine acetate***L Arginine***Arginine, L isomer***Arginine, L-isomer***Hydrochloride, arginine***Arginine hydrochloride***DL Arginine acetate, monohydrate",L-Arginine,,C6H15N4O2,1,174.201,174.1116757,http://identifiers.org/vmhmetabolite/arg_L,arg__L,,,HC00065,C00062,6322.0,16467.0,CHEMBL1485,"InChI=1S/C6H14N4O2/c7-4(5(11)12)2-1-3-10-6(8)9/h4H,1-3,7H2,(H,11,12)(H4,8,9,10)/p+1/t4-/m0/s1",ODKSFYDXXFIFQN-BYPYZUCNSA-O,[H]N([H])C(N([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])[C@@]([H])(C([O-])=O)[N+]([H])([H])[H])=[N+]([H])[H],HMDB0000517,MNXM70,cpd00051,L-Arg,arg_L,arg_L,,,arg_L,,,,FDB002257,6082.0,ARG,L-Arginine,DB00125,C00001340,,5502.0,74-79-3,DTXSID6041056,100.000.738,721.0,94ZLA3W45F,D001120,arg_L,True,True,2018-05-31T15:53:21.702280Z,2018-09-24T15:08:14.641735Z,ARG,Arginase Deficiency,Inherited metabolic disorder,Amino acid disorders,Autosomal recessive,207800,207800,207800.0,207800.0,No genotype-phenotype correlation has been found.

Once in the brain, it is a precursor for the neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine, better known as adrenalin. These neurotransmitters are an important part of the body's sympathetic nervous system, and their concentrations in the body and brain are directly dependent upon dietary tyrosine. Tyrosine is not found in large concentrations throughout the body, probably because it is rapidly metabolized. Folic acid, copper and vitamin C are cofactor nutrients of these reactions. Tyrosine is also the precursor for hormones, thyroid, catecholestrogens and the major human pigment, melanin. Tyrosine is an important amino acid in many proteins, peptides and even enkephalins, the body's natural pain reliever. Valine and other branched amino acids, and possibly tryptophan and phenylalanine may reduce tyrosine absorption. A number of genetic errors of tyrosine metabolism occur, such as hawkinsinuria and tyrosinemia I. Most common is the increased amount of tyrosine in the blood of premature infants, which is marked by decreased motor activity, lethargy and poor feeding. Infection and intellectual deficits may occur. Vitamin C supplements reverse the disease. Some adults also develop elevated tyrosine in their blood. This indicates a need for more vitamin C. More tyrosine is needed under stress, and tyrosine supplements prevent the stress-induced depletion of norepinephrine and can cure biochemical depression.

It is not among the essential amino acids. Glutamate is a key molecule in cellular metabolism. In humans, dietary proteins are broken down by digestion into amino acids, which serves as metabolic fuel or other functional roles in the body. Glutamate is the most abundant fast excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian nervous system. At chemical synapses, glutamate is stored in vesicles. Nerve impulses trigger release of glutamate from the pre-synaptic cell. In the opposing post-synaptic cell, glutamate receptors, such as the NMDA receptor, bind glutamate and are activated. Because of its role in synaptic plasticity, it is believed that glutamic acid is involved in cognitive functions like learning and memory in the brain. Glutamate transporters are found in neuronal and glial membranes. They rapidly remove glutamate from the extracellular space. In brain injury or disease, they can work in reverse and excess glutamate can accumulate outside cells. This process causes calcium ions to enter cells via NMDA receptor channels, leading to neuronal damage and eventual cell death, and is called excitotoxicity. The mechanisms of cell death include: Damage to mitochondria from excessively high intracellular Ca2+. Glu/Ca2+-mediated promotion of transcription factors for pro-apoptotic genes, or downregulation of transcription factors for anti-apoptotic genes. Excitotoxicity due to glutamate occurs as part of the ischemic cascade and is associated with stroke and diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, lathyrism, and Alzheimer's disease. glutamic acid has been implicated in epileptic seizures. Microinjection of glutamic acid into neurons produces spontaneous depolarization around one second apart, and this firing pattern is similar to what is known as paroxysmal depolarizing shift in epileptic attacks. This change in the resting membrane potential at seizure foci could cause spontaneous opening of voltage activated calcium channels, leading to glutamic acid release and further depolarization (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamic_acid). Moreover, glutamic acid is found to be associated with N-acetylglutamate synthetase deficiency, which is an inborn error of metabolism.","(S)-2-Aminopentanedioic acid***(S)-Glutamic acid***Acide glutamique***acido Glutamico***Acidum glutamicum***E***Glu***Glutamate***GLUTAMIC ACID***L-Glu***L-Glutaminic acid***L-Glutaminsaeure***(S)-2-Aminopentanedioate***L-Glutamate***(S)-Glutamate***L-Glutaminate***(2S)-2-Aminopentanedioate***(2S)-2-Aminopentanedioic acid***(S)-(+)-Glutamate***(S)-(+)-Glutamic acid***1-amino-Propane-1,3-dicarboxylate***1-amino-Propane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid***1-Aminopropane-1,3-dicarboxylate***1-Aminopropane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid***2-Aminoglutarate***2-Aminoglutaric acid***2-Aminopentanedioate***2-Aminopentanedioic acid***a-Aminoglutarate***a-Aminoglutaric acid***a-Glutamate***a-Glutamic acid***Aciglut***alpha-Aminoglutarate***alpha-Aminoglutaric acid***alpha-Glutamate***alpha-Glutamic acid***Aminoglutarate***Aminoglutaric acid***Glt***Glusate***Glut***Glutacid***Glutamicol***Glutamidex***Glutaminate***Glutaminic acid***Glutaminol***Glutaton***L-(+)-Glutamate***L-(+)-Glutamic acid***L-a-Aminoglutarate***L-a-Aminoglutaric acid***L-alpha-Aminoglutarate***L-alpha-Aminoglutaric acid***D Glutamate***Glutamate, potassium***Glutamic acid, (D)-isomer***L Glutamic acid***D-Glutamate***L Glutamate***Aluminum L glutamate***Aluminum L-glutamate***L-Glutamate, aluminum***Potassium glutamate",L-Glutamic acid,,C5H8NO4,-1,147.1293,147.0531578,http://identifiers.org/vmhmetabolite/glu_L,glu__L,,,HC00034,C00025,33032.0,16015.0,,"InChI=1S/C5H9NO4/c6-3(5(9)10)1-2-4(7)8/h3H,1-2,6H2,(H,7,8)(H,9,10)/p-1/t3-/m0/s1",WHUUTDBJXJRKMK-VKHMYHEASA-M,[H][N+]([H])([H])[C@]([H])(C([O-])=O)C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([O-])=O,HMDB0000148,MNXM89557,cpd00023,L-Glutamate;L-glutamate;L-glutamic acid,glu_L,glu_L,,glu_L,glu_L,,,glu_L,FDB012535,30572.0,GLT,E,,C00001358,,5174.0,56-86-0,DTXSID5020659,,,,,glu_L,True,True,2018-05-31T15:53:21.702280Z,2018-09-24T15:08:43.065077Z,PC,Pyruvate Carboxylase Deficiency,Inherited metabolic disorder,Carbohydrate disorder,Autosomal recessive,266150,266150,266150.0,266150.0,"1) Type A (infantile form) - infantile onset. 2) Type B (severe neonatal form) -Although the majority of affected infants die within the first three months of life, two are alive at ages nine and 20 years, likely due to mosaicism. 3) Type C (intermittent/benign form). 4) Mosaicism was found in five individuals. 5) Homozygous mutations.

Some cells synthesize it from citrulline, aspartic acid and use it as a precursor for arginine in the urea cycle or Citrulline-NO cycle. The enzyme that catalyzes the reaction is argininosuccinate synthetase. Argininosuccinic acid is a precursor to fumarate in the citric acid cycle via argininosuccinate lyase. Defects in the argininosuccinate lyase enzyme can lead to argininosuccinate lyase deficiency, which is an inborn error of metabolism. Argininosuccinate (ASA) lyase deficiency results in defective cleavage of ASA. This leads to an accumulation of ASA in cells and an excessive excretion of ASA in urine (argininosuccinic aciduria). In virtually all respects, this disorder shares the characteristics of other urea cycle defects. The most important characteristic of ASA lyase deficiency is its propensity to cause hyperammonemia in affected individuals. ASA in affected individuals is excreted by the kidney at a rate practically equivalent to the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Whether ASA itself causes a degree of toxicity due to hepatocellular accumulation is unknown; such an effect could help explain hyperammonemia development in affected individuals. Regardless, the name of the disease is derived from the rapid clearance of ASA in urine, although elevated levels of ASA can be found in plasma. ASA lyase deficiency is associated with high mortality and morbidity rates. Symptoms of ASA lyase deficiency include anorexia, irritability rapid breathing, lethargy and vomiting. Extreme symptoms include coma and cerebral edema.","2-(Nomega-L-arginino)succinate***L-Argininosuccinate***L-Argininosuccinic acid***L-Arginosuccinic acid***2-(Nomega-L-arginino)succinic acid***Argininosuccinate***L-Arginosuccinate***2-(N(Omega)-L-arginine)succinate***2-(N(Omega)-L-arginine)succinic acid***2-(N(Omega)-L-arginino)succinate***2-(N(Omega)-L-arginino)succinic acid***2-(Nw-l-arginino)butanedioate***2-(Nw-l-arginino)butanedioic acid***Arginosuccinate***Arginosuccinic acid***ASA***N(Omega)-(L-arginino)succinate***N(Omega)-(L-arginino)succinic acid***N-(((4-amino-4-Carboxybutyl)amino)iminomethyl)-L-aspartate***N-(((4-amino-4-Carboxybutyl)amino)iminomethyl)-L-aspartic acid***N-(L-arginino) Succinate***N-(L-arginino) Succinic acid***N-(L-arginino)Succinate***N-(L-arginino)Succinic acid***N-[(4-amino-4-Carboxybutyl)amidino]-L-aspartate***N-[(4-amino-4-Carboxybutyl)amidino]-L-aspartic acid***N-[[(4-amino-4-Carboxybutyl)amino]iminomethyl]-L-aspartate***N-[[(4-amino-4-Carboxybutyl)amino]iminomethyl]-L-aspartic acid***Acid, argininosuccinic***N-(4-amino-4-Carboxybutyl)amidino-L-aspartic acid",N-{N'-[(4S)-4-Amino-4-carboxybutyl]carbamimidoyl}-L-aspartic acid,,C10H17N4O6,-1,290.2731,290.1226343,http://identifiers.org/vmhmetabolite/argsuc,argsuc,,,HC01113,C03406,16950.0,15682.0,,"InChI=1S/C10H18N4O6/c11-5(8(17)18)2-1-3-13-10(12)14-6(9(19)20)4-7(15)16/h5-6H,1-4,11H2,(H,15,16)(H,17,18)(H,19,20)(H3,12,13,14)/p-1/t5-,6?/m0/s1",KDZOASGQNOPSCU-ZBHICJROSA-M,[H]N(C(N([H])C([H])(C([O-])=O)C([H])([H])C([O-])=O)=[N+]([H])[H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])[C@@]([H])(C([O-])=O)[N+]([H])([H])[H],HMDB0000052,MNXM550,cpd02152,,argsuc,argsuc,,,,,,,FDB021885,16059.0,,Argininosuccinic acid,,C00019688,,5115.0,2387-71-5,DTXSID80178574,,,,,argsuc,True,True,2018-05-31T15:53:21.702280Z,2018-09-24T15:08:14.806888Z,ASA,Argininosuccinic Aciduria,Inherited metabolic disorder,Amino acid disorders,Autosomal recessive,207900,207900,207900.0,207900.0,Asai et al.

However, it is so important in providing energy to muscles including the heart-that some researchers are now recommending carnitine supplements in the diet, particularly for people who do not consume much red meat, the main food source for carnitine. Carnitine has been described as a vitamin, an amino acid, or a metabimin, i.e., an essential metabolite. Like the B vitamins, carnitine contains nitrogen and is very soluble in water, and to some researchers carnitine is a vitamin (Liebovitz 1984). It was found that an animal (yellow mealworm) could not grow without carnitine in its diet. However, as it turned out, almost all other animals, including humans, do make their own carnitine; thus, it is no longer considered a vitamin. Nevertheless, in certain circumstances-such as deficiencies of methionine, lysine or vitamin C or kidney dialysis--carnitine shortages develop. Under these conditions, carnitine must be absorbed from food, and for this reason it is sometimes referred to as a ""metabimin"" or a conditionally essential metabolite. Like the other amino acids used or manufactured by the body, carnitine is an amine. But like choline, which is sometimes considered to be a B vitamin, carnitine is also an alcohol (specifically, a trimethylated carboxy-alcohol). Thus, carnitine is an unusual amino acid and has different functions than most other amino acids, which are most usually employed by the body in the construction of protein. Carnitine is an essential factor in fatty acid metabolism in mammals. It's most important known metabolic function is to transport fat into the mitochondria of muscle cells, including those in the heart, for oxidation. This is how the heart gets most of its energy. In humans, about 25% of carnitine is synthesized in the liver, kidney and brain from the amino acids lysine and methionine. Most of the carnitine in the body comes from dietary sources such as red meat and dairy products. Inborn errors of carnitine metabolism can lead to brain deterioration like that of Reye's syndrome, gradually worsening muscle weakness, Duchenne-like muscular dystrophy and extreme muscle weakness with fat accumulation in muscles. Borurn et al. (1979) describe carnitine as an essential nutrient for pre-term babies, certain types (non-ketotic) of hypoglycemics, kidney dialysis patients, cirrhosis, and in kwashiorkor, type IV hyperlipidemia, heart muscle disease (cardiomyopathy), and propionic or organic aciduria (acid urine resulting from genetic disease such as propionic acidemia or other anomalies). In all these conditions and the inborn errors of carnitine metabolism, carnitine is essential to life and carnitine supplements are valuable. carnitine therapy may also be useful in a wide variety of clinical conditions. carnitine supplementation has improved some patients who have angina secondary to coronary artery disease. It may be worth a trial in any form of hyperlipidemia or muscle weakness. carnitine supplements may be useful in many forms of toxic or metabolic liver disease and in cases of heart muscle disease. Hearts undergoing severe arrhythmia quickly deplete their stores of carnitine. Athletes, particularly in Europe, have used carnitine supplements for improved endurance. carnitine may improve muscle building by improving fat utilization and may even be useful in treating obesity. carnitine joins a long list of nutrients which may be of value in treating pregnant women, hypothyroid individuals, and male infertility due to low motility of sperm.

However, it is so important in providing energy to muscles including the heart-that some researchers are now recommending carnitine supplements in the diet, particularly for people who do not consume much red meat, the main food source for carnitine. Carnitine has been described as a vitamin, an amino acid, or a metabimin, i.e., an essential metabolite. Like the B vitamins, carnitine contains nitrogen and is very soluble in water, and to some researchers carnitine is a vitamin (Liebovitz 1984). It was found that an animal (yellow mealworm) could not grow without carnitine in its diet. However, as it turned out, almost all other animals, including humans, do make their own carnitine; thus, it is no longer considered a vitamin. Nevertheless, in certain circumstances-such as deficiencies of methionine, lysine or vitamin C or kidney dialysis--carnitine shortages develop. Under these conditions, carnitine must be absorbed from food, and for this reason it is sometimes referred to as a ""metabimin"" or a conditionally essential metabolite. Like the other amino acids used or manufactured by the body, carnitine is an amine. But like choline, which is sometimes considered to be a B vitamin, carnitine is also an alcohol (specifically, a trimethylated carboxy-alcohol). Thus, carnitine is an unusual amino acid and has different functions than most other amino acids, which are most usually employed by the body in the construction of protein. Carnitine is an essential factor in fatty acid metabolism in mammals. It's most important known metabolic function is to transport fat into the mitochondria of muscle cells, including those in the heart, for oxidation. This is how the heart gets most of its energy. In humans, about 25% of carnitine is synthesized in the liver, kidney and brain from the amino acids lysine and methionine. Most of the carnitine in the body comes from dietary sources such as red meat and dairy products. Inborn errors of carnitine metabolism can lead to brain deterioration like that of Reye's syndrome, gradually worsening muscle weakness, Duchenne-like muscular dystrophy and extreme muscle weakness with fat accumulation in muscles. Borurn et al. (1979) describe carnitine as an essential nutrient for pre-term babies, certain types (non-ketotic) of hypoglycemics, kidney dialysis patients, cirrhosis, and in kwashiorkor, type IV hyperlipidemia, heart muscle disease (cardiomyopathy), and propionic or organic aciduria (acid urine resulting from genetic disease such as propionic acidemia or other anomalies). In all these conditions and the inborn errors of carnitine metabolism, carnitine is essential to life and carnitine supplements are valuable. carnitine therapy may also be useful in a wide variety of clinical conditions. carnitine supplementation has improved some patients who have angina secondary to coronary artery disease. It may be worth a trial in any form of hyperlipidemia or muscle weakness. carnitine supplements may be useful in many forms of toxic or metabolic liver disease and in cases of heart muscle disease. Hearts undergoing severe arrhythmia quickly deplete their stores of carnitine. Athletes, particularly in Europe, have used carnitine supplements for improved endurance. carnitine may improve muscle building by improving fat utilization and may even be useful in treating obesity. carnitine joins a long list of nutrients which may be of value in treating pregnant women, hypothyroid individuals, and male infertility due to low motility of sperm. Even the Physician's Desk Reference gives indication for carnitine supplements as ""improving the tolerance of ischemic heart disease, myocardial insufficiencies, and type IV hyperlipoproteinemia. carnitine deficiency is noted in abnormal liver function, renal dialysis patients, and severe to moderate muscular weakness with associated anorexia.""

Isovaleric acidemia is an autosomal recessive inborn error of leucine metabolism caused by a deficiency of the mitochondrial enzyme isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.99.10) resulting in the accumulation of derivatives of isovaleryl-CoA. It was the first organic acidemia recognized in humans and can cause significant morbidity and mortality. Early diagnosis and treatment with a protein restricted diet and supplementation with carnitine and glycine are effective in promoting normal development in severely affected individuals.

Acyl carnitines are organic compounds containing a fatty acid with the carboxylic acid attached to carnitine through an ester bond. Thus, decanoylcarnitine is considered to be a fatty ester lipid molecule. Decanoylcarnitine is practically insoluble (in water) and a weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Decanoylcarnitine can be found primarily in blood, feces, and urine. Within the cell, decanoylcarnitine is primarily located in the membrane. It can also be found in the extracellular space. Acyl carnitines are useful in the diagnosis of genetic disorders such as fatty acid oxidation disorders and differentiation between biochemical phenotypes of medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency (PMID: 12385891).

Acyl carnitines are organic compounds containing a fatty acid with the carboxylic acid attached to carnitine through an ester bond. Thus, decanoylcarnitine is considered to be a fatty ester lipid molecule. Decanoylcarnitine is practically insoluble (in water) and a weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Decanoylcarnitine can be found primarily in blood, feces, and urine. Within the cell, decanoylcarnitine is primarily located in the membrane. It can also be found in the extracellular space. Acyl carnitines are useful in the diagnosis of genetic disorders such as fatty acid oxidation disorders and differentiation between biochemical phenotypes of medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency (PMID: 12385891). Moreover, decanoylcarnitine is found to be associated with very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLAD) deficiency, glutaric aciduria II, and celiac disease, which are inborn errors of metabolism.","Decanoyl-L-carnitine***Decanoylcarnitine, (+-)-isomer***Decanoylcarnitine, (R)-isomer***Decanoylcarnitine, (S)-isomer",3-(decanoyloxy)-4-(trimethylazaniumyl)butanoate,,C17H33NO4,0,315.4482,315.2409585,http://identifiers.org/vmhmetabolite/c10crn,,,,,,10245190.0,68830.0,,"InChI=1S/C17H33NO4/c1-5-6-7-8-9-10-11-12-17(21)22-15(13-16(19)20)14-18(2,3)4/h15H,5-14H2,1-4H3",LZOSYCMHQXPBFU-UHFFFAOYSA-N,[H]C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C([H])([H])C(=O)OC([H])(C([H])([H])C([O-])=O)C([H])([H])[N+](C([H])([H])[H])(C([H])([H])[H])C([H])([H])[H],HMDB0000651,,,,c10crn,c10crn,,,,,,,FDB022162,8420677.0,PALMITOYL-CARNITINE,,,,,5623.0,1492-27-9,,,,,,,True,False,2018-05-31T15:53:21.702280Z,2018-09-24T15:08:54.652472Z,GA2,Glutaric Acidemia Type II,Inherited metabolic disorder,Fatty acid disorders,Autosomal recessive,231680,231680.0,231680.0,231680.0,"1) Neonatal form and 2) late onset form.

L-palmitoylcarnitine, due to its amphipatic character is, like detergents, a surface-active molecule and by changing the membrane fluidity and surface charge can change activity of several enzymes and transporters localized in the membrane. L-palmitoylcarnitine has been also reported to change the activity of certain proteins. On the contrary to carnitine, palmitoylcarnitine was shown to stimulate the activity of caspases 3, 7 and 8 and the level of this long-chain acylcarnitine increased during apoptosis. Palmitoylcarnitine was also reported to diminish completely binding of phorbol esters, the protein kinase C activators and to decrease the autophosphorylation of the enzyme. Apart from these isoform nonspecific phenomena, palmitoylcarnitine was also shown to be responsible for retardation in cytoplasm of protein kinase C isoforms &#946; and &#948; and, in the case of the latter one, to decrease its interaction with GAP-43. Some of the physico-chemical properties of palmitoylcarnitine may help to explain the need for coenzyme A-carnitine-coenzyme A acyl exchange during mitochondrial fatty acid import. The amphiphilic character of palmitoylcarnitine may also explain its proposed involvement in the pathogenesis of myocardial ischemia. L-palmitoylcarnitine accumulates in ischemic myocardium and potentially contribute to myocardial damage through alterations in membrane molecular dynamics, one mechanism through which could play an important role in ischemic injury. Palmitoylcarnitine is characteristically elevated in carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiency, late-onset (OMIM 255110 PMID 2540838, 15363641, 8706815).
